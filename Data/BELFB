Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. ------------------------------------- On March 21, 2003, Bel Fuse Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Registrant"), completed its acquisition of the Passive Components Group of Insilco Technologies, Inc. ("Insilco"). Pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement, dated as of December 15, 2002, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to such stock and asset purchase agreement, dated as of March 21, 2003 (as so amended, the "Purchase Agreement"), among the Registrant, certain subsidiaries of the Registrant, Insilco and certain of Insilco's subsidiaries, the Registrant and Registrant's subsidiaries acquired substantially all of the assets, subject to certain of the liabilities, of Stewart Connector Systems, Inc., InNet Technologies, Inc. and Signal Transformer Co., Inc., as well as the stock of several of Insilco's foreign subsidiaries. The net purchase price paid by the Registrant amounted to $35 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The Registrant funded approximately $10 million of the purchase price by means of a loan made in the ordinary course of business by a banking institution, whose name has been omitted from this Report but furnished by separate correspondence to the SEC, and the remainder of the purchase price from internally generated funds. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement were approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on March 10, 2003 as part of Chapter XI bankruptcy proceedings commenced voluntarily by Insilco and several of its affiliated companies. The Registrant intends to continue the use of the assets acquired in the passive components business. - 2 -

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of Insilco Technologies, Inc. In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related combined statements of operations, of equity and comprehensive income (loss) and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the Passive Components Group (the Companies), wholly owned subsidiaries of Insilco Technologies, Inc. (Insilco), at November 1, 2002 and December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their combined operations and their combined cash flows for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of Insilco's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As explained in Note 1, the combined financial statements include certain costs allocated by Insilco that are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would have been recorded by the Companies on a stand-alone basis. As explained in Note 12, there is substantial doubt about Insilco's and the Companies' ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. January 14, 2003 - 6 -

PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The combined financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Passive Components Group for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The Passive Components Group consists of three business units and their subsidiaries (all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Insilco Technologies, Inc.) (Insilco or the Parent): Signal Transformer Co., Inc. (Signal); InNet Technologies, Inc. (InNet), which was purchased on January 10, 2001; and Stewart Connector Systems, Inc. (SCS), herein referred to as Passive Components or the Companies. The Companies' operations consist of the manufacturing and sale of telecommunications and electrical component products. Passive Components is not a separate legal entity and since no direct ownership in the Companies as a combined group exists, Insilco's net investment and advances in the Companies is shown in lieu of stockholder's equity in the combined financial statements and includes the accumulation of transactions between the Companies and Insilco described below. All intercompany accounts and transactions amongst the Passive Components Group have been eliminated. Sales to other subsidiaries of Insilco were approximately $45,000 for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and $20,000 and $41,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable. However, the combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows presented herein may not be the same as would have occurred had the Companies operated as stand-alone entities during the periods presented and may not be indicative of future financial results. INTERCOMPANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARENT The combined financial statements include allocations of Insilco's corporate overhead, executive management and administrative expenses amounting to $1.2 million for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and $2.0 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which are included in the Allocated corporate costs line in the statement of operations. These allocations include the general administrative expenses of Insilco's corporate office, such as accounting, information technology, human resources, legal, environmental, treasury, and tax. As specific identification of these expenses was not practical, allocations were charged based on a formula factoring in the ratio of the Companies' forecasted annual sales, forecasted assets, and actual number of employees in proportion to Insilco's consolidated numbers for these categories. The resulting ratio was applied to Insilco's forecasted corporate expenses and allocated to the Companies rateably over each year. Insilco's management believes that this allocation method is reasonable, however, the allocations do not necessarily represent what the Companies would have incurred on a stand-alone basis. As the Companies were operated in a decentralized manner with their own administrative infrastructure, and the Companies would likely make different decisions regarding administrative initiatives, their overhead expenses as a separate company would be different than that reflected in the combined financial statements. - 11 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Companies' combined financial statements also include allocations of Insilco's interest expense totalling $2.8 million for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and $7.1 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which are included in the Allocated interest expense line in the statement of operations. Interest expense has been allocated generally based on the Companies' net assets in proportion to Insilco's consolidated net assets. The interest rate applied was 10.0% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, which represents an estimated weighted average cost of capital. The amounts used to calculate interest expense do not necessarily reflect the level of indebtedness the Companies would incur as a separate entity. Insilco's management believes these are reasonable estimates of the cost of financing the Companies' assets and operations in the past. However, the Companies may not be able to obtain financing at interest rates similar to those used for the interest expense calculation. Accordingly, the Companies' interest expense and financing costs as a separate entity may be different than that reflected in the combined financial statements. Insilco uses a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations. The Companies' cash accounts are swept on a daily basis and are netted against the net investment and advances account. As a result, none of Insilco's cash, cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level has been allocated to the Companies in the combined financial statements, other than the $25 million portion of the credit facility drawn specifically to fund the acquisition of InNet in 2001. Cash in the combined financial statements primarily represents amounts held locally by the Companies' operations in their various geographic areas. ACQUISITION On January 10, 2001, Insilco acquired the outstanding equity interests in InNet, excluding approximately 16% of the outstanding equity interests that Insilco already owned. InNet, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Insilco, is a California-based designer, developer and marketer of a broad range of magnetic interface products for networking, computer and telecommunications original equipment manufacturers. The gross purchase price paid for the remaining equity interests was $44.9 million and was financed with cash and additional borrowings of $25.0 million under the Parent's credit facility. The purchase method of accounting has been used to account for the purchase; accordingly, the results of operations of InNet have been included in the Companies' combined financial statements from January 10, 2001. The purchase price, net of cash acquired and including costs incurred directly related to the transaction, was $44.2 million. The excess of the purchase price over identifiable assets acquired was $37.9 million, which was being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. InNet subsequently evaluated the recoverability of the goodwill and recorded a pretax impairment charge of $35.1 million in 2001. For further discussion, see Note 11, Impairment of Goodwill. - 12 -

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents include time deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $1.8 million, $1.5 million and $1.2 million at November 1, 2002, December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is generally determined using the first-in, first-out cost method. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives, which is 25 years for new buildings and ranges from 3 to 9 years for machinery and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management's plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS Deferred financing costs are being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the related debt. Deferred financing costs were $1,134,000, $1,313,000 and $749,000, net of accumulated amortization of approximately $528,000, $289,000 and $45,000 at November 1, 2002 and December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization expense was approximately $239,000 for the period ended November 1, 2002, $244,000 in 2001 and $45,000 in 2000. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers. Provisions for returns and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of the Companies' foreign subsidiaries are translated at the balance sheet date exchange rates and statement of operations accounts are translated at the average rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of equity. - 13 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND COMPLIANCE Environmental remediation and compliance expenditures are expensed or capitalized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Liabilities are recorded when it is probable the obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate book value at November 1, 2002, December 31, 2001 and 2000. Due to the situation described in Notes 12 and 13, management is not able to make a fair determination of the fair value of the debt. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Companies are subject to concentration of credit risk relating to cash and equivalents. The Companies maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions. The Companies monitor the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limit the amounts of credit exposure with any one entity. The Companies also monitor the creditworthiness of the entities to which they grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The Companies are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companies' combined revenues in 2002, 2001 or 2000. INCOME TAXES Passive Components is not a separate tax paying entity. Passive Components is included in Insilco's combined federal and certain state income tax groups for income tax reporting purposes and is responsible for its proportionate share of income taxes calculated upon its federal taxable income at a current estimate of the annual effective tax rate. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse. Determination of the amount of valuation allowance recognized is based upon an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the combined statements of equity and comprehensive income (loss). - 14 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATES In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and, therefore, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Statement No. 146 eliminates the definition and requirement for recognition of exit costs in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 where a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Companies believe that the adoption of this statement will not have a significant impact on the results of operations or financial position. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to the guarantor's accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. This interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of certain types of guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor's fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Companies are assessing the impact the adoption of this interpretation will have on the results of operations or financial position. - 15 -

ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES A summary of accrued expenses and other current liabilities at November 1, 2002 and December 31, 2001 and 2000 follows (in thousands): 6. LONG-TERM DEBT On January 10, 2001, Insilco increased its credit facility by $25.0 million to fund the acquisition of InNet. This debt is reflected in the combined balance sheets of the Companies at December 31, 2001 and November 1, 2002. The related interest expense, deferred financing costs, amortization expense and accumulated amortization have also been reflected on the combined balance sheets and combined statements of operations of the Companies. The outstanding balance under the credit facility is subject to twenty-three mandatory quarterly payments of $62,500 and two payments of $11,781,250 in each of year six and seven. Interest accrues under the credit facility at floating rates calculated with respect to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Bank One's Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The margin, in turn, fluctuates based on Insilco's debt covenant ratios. LIBOR at November 1, 2002 was 1.66%. At November 1, 2002, the applicable margin for the credit facility was LIBOR plus 4.5%. The credit facilities of the Parent are guaranteed by all of Insilco's subsidiaries, including the Companies. In addition, the obligations thereunder are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Companies. The credit facility contains certain financial covenants including, but not limited to, covenants related to minimum EBITDA, maximum debt and a limit on annual capital expenditures. The credit facility also contains certain negative covenants typical of credit agreements of this type including, but not limited to, a prohibition on the ability of Insilco and its domestic subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness in excess of certain agreed upon amounts, and to make investments other than permitted investments, and also restricts Insilco and its subsidiaries from paying any - 17 -

As a result of the situation described in Notes 12 and 13, the outstanding debt obligation under the credit facility has been classified as current. 7. BENEFIT PLANS Certain Signal and SCS employees participate in Insilco's defined benefit pension plans. The benefits under these plans are based primarily on employees' years of service and compensation near retirement. The Companies' funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and regulations. The net periodic pension cost allocated to the Companies associated with Insilco's defined benefit pension plans was $164,000 during the ten months ended November 1, 2002, $127,000 during 2001 and $(71,000) during 2000. Signal also contributes to a multi-employer plan sponsored by a bargaining unit for its union employees. Signal recognized expenses of $201,000 during the ten months ended November 1, 2002, $295,000 in 2001, and $313,000 in 2000 related to contributions to this multi-employer plan. In addition to the defined benefit plans described above, Signal and SCS employees may participate in a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan sponsored by Insilco, which covers substantially all nonunion employees of the Companies and their subsidiaries, and which covers union employees at one of the Companies' subsidiaries. The Companies match 50% of participants' voluntary contributions up to a maximum of 3% of each participant's eligible compensation, subject to limitations required by government laws or regulations. The Companies' expense related to this plan was approximately $76,000 during the ten months ended November 1, 2002, and $119,000 and $174,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. InNet sponsors a SIMPLE IRA plan for its employees. InNet's contributions to this plan on behalf of its employees were $36,000 during the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and $37,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. - 18 -

Such amounts were insignificant for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and the year ended December 31, 2001 and approximately $1,006,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Foreign income tax obligations have been paid directly by the foreign subsidiaries. - 19 -

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities follows (in thousands): Deferred taxes were not provided on cumulative unremitted earnings of $8,961,000 and $9,238,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for certain subsidiaries outside the United States because it was expected that the earnings would be permanently reinvested and determination was not practical. In 2002, current taxes were provided on the earnings of those foreign subsidiaries because it is expected that the earnings will not be permanently reinvested due to financial obligations of Insilco. At November 1, 2002, the Companies had net operating loss carryforwards for Federal tax purposes of $20.9 million, which will begin to expire in 2022. Insilco and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. 9. RESTRUCTURING AND PLANT CLOSING COSTS During the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and the year ended December 31, 2001, the Companies recorded $1,744,000 and $181,000, respectively, of restructuring and plant closing costs relating to the closure of facilities in New York and the Dominican Republic and a sales office located in Japan. These closings were under taken to reduce operating costs. During 2001, the Companies paid approximately $181,000 related to these restructuring charges. There were no charges during 2000. - 21 -

As of November 1, 2002, the Companies had an accrual of $1,728,000 relating to these restructuring charges, which is included in accrued expenses on the balance sheet. A summary of this accrual is as follows (in thousands): The headcount reduction from these activities was approximately 73 employees. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Rental expense for operating leases totaled $1.2 million, $2.0 million, and $824,000 for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These leases primarily relate to production facilities. Future minimum lease payments under contractually noncancelable operating leases (with initial lease terms in excess of one year) for years subsequent to November 1, 2002 are as follows (in thousands): The Companies are subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Companies accrue for amounts related to legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable. No amounts were accrued related to legal matters at November 1, 2002, December 31, 2001 or 2000. The Companies' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials - 22 -

The Companies have a program for monitoring its compliance with applicable environmental regulations, the interpretation of which often is subjective. The Companies have taken significant measures to (1) address emissions, discharges and waste generation and disposal, (2) improve management practices and operations in response to legal requirements, and (3) internally review compliance with applicable environmental regulations and approved practices. In order to achieve these goals, the Companies have instituted several programs including (1) raw material and process substitution, recycling and material management, (2) periodic review of hazardous waste storage and disposal practices, and (3) review of compliance and financial status and management practices of our offsite third-party waste management firms. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of the matters discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on the Companies' combined financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 11. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL During the first half of 2001, the Companies experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth due to a dramatic decline in capital spending in the telecommunications industry. During the second quarter of 2001, major customers further reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed. Management believed that the growth prospects for these business segments were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods. The Companies review the value of their long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may be impaired. As a result of the business conditions noted above, Insilco concluded such a review was required for its recent acquisition of InNet, acquired in January 2001, and the related goodwill. The review was completed in a series of tests. The first test included the following steps: (1) management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset based on estimated growth levels; (2) management estimated the terminal value of the asset based on an appropriate multiple of EBITDA; and (3) management compared the sum of the future cash flows and terminal value to the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if an impairment has occurred. If an impairment had occurred, management performed a second test as follows: (1) management discounted the future cash flows and terminal value, using EBITDA as a proxy for cash flow, to a present value using an appropriate discount rate; and (2) management compared the discounted net present value to the carrying value of long lived assets to determine the amount of the impairment. As a result of this review, management determined that the goodwill related to the acquisition of InNet was impaired and, in accordance with Insilco's policy it was necessary to write down the goodwill. Thus in 2001, InNet recorded a pretax impairment charge of $35.1 million. - 23 -

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. GOING CONCERN MATTERS On February 15, 2002, the Parent failed to make a required interest payment on its 12% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2007 (the 12% Notes). The 30-day grace period for such payment expired on March 18, 2002, resulting in an event of default under the indenture governing the 12% Notes, as well as a cross-default under the Parent's Senior Secured Credit facility (the Amended Credit Agreement). Further, on March 31, 2002, the Parent failed to meet the EBITDA covenant under its Amended Credit Agreement and was in default on its Amended Credit Agreement and its 12% Notes. Subsequently, the Parent did not make the $7.2 million August 15, 2002 required interest payment on its 12% Notes and did not meet the EBITDA covenants under its Amended Credit Agreement for June 30 and September 30, 2002. At September 30, 2002, the Parent continued to operate under these defaults and, therefore, has classified as current, its debt obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 12% Notes and the 14% Senior Discount Notes Due 2008 (the 14% Notes). On May 3, 2002, the Parent and the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement (the Lenders) entered into a forbearance agreement (Forbearance Agreement). Under the Forbearance Agreement, the Lenders agreed that, absent a further default, they would not (a) accelerate the maturity of the debt under the Amended Credit Agreement, (b) take enforcement action against any collateral, including effecting any rights of setoff, or (c) commence any legal action to enforce rights or remedies pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, for the period from May 3, 2002 until July 10, 2002 (the Forbearance Period). This agreement was subsequently amended to extend the Forbearance Period through November 4, 2002. The purpose of the Forbearance Period was to allow the Parent time to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, such as a sale of all or some of the business, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, or other remedies appropriate for the circumstances. To that end, the Parent engaged in active discussions with potential purchasers of substantially all of the assets of its three business segments, including the Passive Components Group, which the Parent anticipates will result in multiple sales of these business segments through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The Parent's recent losses and highly leveraged position raise substantial doubt about the Parent's and the Companies' ability to continue as a going concern. The combined financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Parent and the Companies become unable to continue as a going concern. 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On December 16, 2002, Insilco Holding Co., the parent company of Insilco, Insilco and several of Insilco's subsidiaries, including the Companies, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The debtors continue to manage their properties and operate their businesses as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Code. - 24 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, Insilco Holding Co. completed its review of strategic alternatives for addressing its capital structure issues and its primary operating subsidiary, Insilco, has entered into definitive agreements to sell substantially all of the assets of its three business segments, including the Passive Components Group, for which the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries have agreed to sell to Bel Fuse Ltd. for approximately $35 million. None of Insilco's operations located outside of the United States were included in the Chapter 11 filings, though the shares of certain foreign subsidiaries and certain foreign assets will be included in the sale transactions. The Chapter 11 filings allow the sale of the assets of the domestic entities to be free and clear from certain liabilities that the prospective purchasers do not wish to assume. On January 14, 2003, the Parent notified the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) that a reportable event occurred in regards to the defined benefit pension plan due to the Chapter 11 filing. The Parent intends to terminate the plan as the potential buyers of the various businesses will not sponsor the existing plan. The plan was in an under-funded position of approximately $17 million, on a termination basis, as of December 31, 2002. Management expects the PBGC to take over as trustee of the plan and that the PBGC will make all future benefit payments to the covered employees after such time. - 25 -

PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The combined financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Passive Components Group for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Passive Components Group consists of three business units and their subsidiaries (all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Insilco Technologies, Inc.) (Insilco or the Parent): Signal Transformer Co., Inc. (Signal); InNet Technologies, Inc. (InNet), which was purchased on January 10, 2001; and Stewart Connector Systems, Inc. (SCS), herein referred to as Passive Components or the Companies. The Companies' operations consist of the manufacturing and sale of telecommunications and electrical component products. Passive Components is not a separate legal entity and since no direct ownership in the Companies as a combined group exists, Insilco's net investment and advances in the Companies is shown in lieu of stockholder's equity in the combined financial statements and includes the accumulation of transactions between the Companies and Insilco described below. All intercompany accounts and transactions amongst the Passive Components Group have been eliminated. Sales to other subsidiaries of Insilco were approximately $28,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable. However, the combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows presented herein may not be the same as would have occurred had the Companies operated as stand-alone entities during the period presented and may not be indicative of future financial results. INTERCOMPANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARENT The combined financial statements include allocations of Insilco's corporate overhead, executive management and administrative expenses amounting to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,, which are included in the Allocated corporate costs line in the statement of operations. These allocations include the general administrative expenses of Insilco's corporate office, such as accounting, information technology, human resources, legal, environmental, treasury, and tax. As specific identification of these expenses was not practical, allocations were charged based on a formula factoring in the ratio of the Companies' forecasted annual sales, forecasted assets, and actual number of employees in proportion to Insilco's consolidated numbers for these categories. The resulting ratio was applied to Insilco's forecasted corporate expenses and allocated to the Companies rateably for the year. Insilco's management believes that this allocation method is reasonable, however, the allocations do not necessarily represent what the Companies would have incurred on a stand-alone basis. As the Companies were operated in a decentralized manner with their own administrative infrastructure, and the Companies would likely make different decisions regarding administrative initiatives, their overhead expenses as a separate company would be different than that reflected in the combined financial statements. - 29 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) The Companies' combined financial statements also include allocations of Insilco's interest expense totaling $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, which are included in the Allocated interest expense line in the statement of operations. Interest expense has been allocated generally based on the Companies' net assets in proportion to Insilco's consolidated net assets. The interest rate applied was 10.0%, which represents an estimated weighted average cost of capital. The amounts used to calculate interest expense do not necessarily reflect the level of indebtedness the Companies would incur as a separate entity. Insilco's management believes these are reasonable estimates of the cost of financing the Companies' assets and operations in the past. However, the Companies may not be able to obtain financing at interest rates similar to those used for the interest expense calculation. Accordingly, the Companies' interest expense and financing costs as a separate entity may be different than that reflected in the combined financial statements. Insilco uses a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations. The Companies' cash accounts are swept on a daily basis and are netted against the net investment and advances account. As a result, none of Insilco's cash, cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level has been allocated to the Companies in the combined financial statements, other than the $25 million portion of the credit facility drawn specifically to fund the acquisition of InNet in 2001. Cash in the combined financial statements primarily represents amounts held locally by the Companies' operations in their various geographic areas. ACQUISITION On January 10, 2001, Insilco acquired the outstanding equity interests in InNet, excluding approximately 16% of the outstanding equity interests that Insilco already owned. InNet, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Insilco, is a California-based designer, developer and marketer of a broad range of magnetic interface products for networking, computer and telecommunications original equipment manufacturers. The gross purchase price paid for the remaining equity interests was $44.9 million and was financed with cash and additional borrowings of $25.0 million under the Parent's credit facility. The purchase method of accounting has been used to account for the purchase; accordingly, the results of operations of InNet have been included in the Companies' combined financial statements from January 10, 2001. The purchase price, net of cash acquired and including costs incurred directly related to the transaction, was $44.2 million. The excess of the purchase price over identifiable assets acquired was $37.9 million, which was being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. InNet subsequently evaluated the recoverability of the goodwill and recorded a pretax impairment charge of $35.l million in 2001. For further discussion, see Note 11, Impairment of Goodwill. - 30 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF LNSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents include time deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $1.7 million at December 31, 2002. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is generally determined using the first-in, first-out cost method. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives, which is 25 years for new buildings and ranges from 3 to 9 years for machinery and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management's plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS Deferred financing costs are being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the related debt. Amortization expense was approximately $1,373,000 for 2002 which includes a $1,098,000 write off of the remaining balance during December 2002. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers. Provisions for returns and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of the Companies' foreign subsidiaries are translated at the balance sheet date exchange rates and statement of operations accounts are translated at the average rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of equity. - 31 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND COMPLIANCE Environmental remediation and compliance expenditures are expensed or capitalized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Liabilities are recorded when it is probable the obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate book value at December 31, 2002. Due to the situation described in Notes 12 and 13, management is not able to make a fair determination of the fair value of the debt. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Companies are subject to concentration of credit risk relating to cash and equivalents. The Companies maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions. The Companies monitor the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limit the amounts of credit exposure with any one entity. The Companies also monitor the creditworthiness of the entities to which they grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The Companies are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companies' combined revenues in 2002. INCOME TAXES Passive Components is not a separate tax paying entity. Passive Components is included in Insilco's combined federal and certain state income tax groups for income tax reporting purposes and is responsible for its proportionate share of income taxes calculated upon its federal taxable income at a current estimate of the annual effective tax rate. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse. Determination of the amount of valuation allowance recognized is based upon an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the combined statements of equity and comprehensive income (loss). - 32 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF LNSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) ESTIMATES In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and, therefore, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Statement No. 146 eliminates the definition and requirement for recognition of exit costs in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 where a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Companies believe that the adoption of this statement will not have a significant impact on the results of operations or financial position. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FA SB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to the guarantor's accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. This interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of certain types of guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor's fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Companies are assessing the impact the adoption of this interpretation will have on the results of operations or financial position. - 33 -

LONG-TERM DEBT On January 10, 2001, Insilco increased its credit facility by $25.0 million to fund the acquisition of InNet. This debt is reflected in the combined balance sheet of the Companies at December 31, 2002. The related interest expense, deferred financing costs, amortization expense and accumulated amortization have also been reflected on the combined balance sheets and combined statements of operations of the Companies. The outstanding balance under the credit facility is subject to twenty-three mandatory quarterly payments of $62,500 and two payments of $l1,781,250 in each of year six and seven. Interest accrues under the credit facility at floating rates calculated with respect to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Bank One's Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The margin, in turn, fluctuates based on Insilco's debt covenant ratios. LIBOR at December 31, 2002 was 1.45%. At December 31, 2002, the applicable margin for the credit facility was LJBOR plus 4.5%. The credit facilities of the Parent are guaranteed by all of Insilco's subsidiaries, including the Companies. In addition, the obligations thereunder are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Companies. The credit facility contains certain financial covenants including, but not limited to, covenants related to minimum EBITDA, maximum debt and a limit on annual capital expenditures. The credit facility also contains certain negative covenants typical of credit agreements of this type including, but not limited to, a prohibition on the ability of Insilco and its domestic subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness in excess of certain agreed upon amounts, and to make investments other than permitted investments, and also restricts Insilco and its subsidiaries from paying any - 35 -

As a result of the situation described in Notes 12 and 13, the outstanding debt obligation under the credit facility has been classified as current. 7. BENEFIT PLANS Certain Signal and SCS employees participate in Insilco's defined benefit pension plans. The benefits under these plans are based primarily on employees' years of service and compensation near retirement. The Companies' funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and regulations. The net periodic pension cost allocated to the Companies associated with Insilco's defined benefit pension plans was $213,000 during 2002. Signal also contributes to a multi-employer plan sponsored by a bargaining unit for its union employees. Signal recognized expenses of $249,000 in 2002 related to contributions to this multi-employer plan. In addition to the defined benefit plans described above, Signal and SCS employees may participate in a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan sponsored by lnsilco, which covers substantially all nonunion employees of the Companies and their subsidiaries, and which covers union employees at one of the Companies' subsidiaries. The Companies match 50% of participants' voluntary contributions up to a maximum of 3% of each participant's eligible compensation, subject to limitations required by government laws or regulations. The Companies' expense related to this plan was approximately $79,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. InNet sponsors a SIMPLE IRA plan for its employees. InNet's contributions to this plan on behalf of its employees were $42,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. - 36 -

The Companies accrue for amounts related to legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable. No amounts were accrued related to legal matters at December 31, 2002. The Companies' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. The Companies have a program for monitoring its compliance with applicable environmental regulations, the interpretation of which often is subjective. The Companies have taken significant measures to (1) address emissions, discharges and waste generation and disposal, (2) improve management practices and operations in response to legal requirements, and (3) internally review compliance with applicable environmental regulations and approved practices. In order to achieve these goals, the Companies have instituted several programs including (1) raw material and process substitution, recycling and material management, (2) periodic review of hazardous waste storage and disposal practices, and (3) review of compliance and financial status and management practices of our offsite third-party waste management firms.

PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF LNSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) 11. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL During the first half of 2001, the Companies experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth due to a dramatic decline in capital spending in the telecommunications industry. During the second quarter of 2001, major customers further reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed. Management believed that the growth prospects for these business segments were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods. The Companies review the value of their long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may be impaired. As a result of the business conditions noted above, Insilco concluded such a review was required for its recent acquisition of InNet, acquired in January 2001, and the related goodwill. The review was completed in a series of tests. The first test included the following steps: (1) management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset based on estimated growth levels; (2) management estimated the terminal value of the asset based on an appropriate multiple of EBITDA; and (3) management compared the sum of the future cash flows and terminal value to the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if an impairment has occurred. If an impairment had occurred, management performed a second test as follows: (1) management discounted the future cash flows and terminal value, using EBITDA as a proxy for cash flow, to a present value using an appropriate discount rate; and (2) management compared the discounted net present value to the carrying value of long lived assets to determine the amount of the impairment. As a result of this review, management determined that the goodwill related to the acquisition of InNet was impaired and, in accordance with Insilco's policy it was necessary to write down the goodwill. Thus in 2001, InNet recorded a pretax impairment charge of $35.1 million. - 41 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) 12. GOING CONCERN MATTERS On February 15, 2002, the Parent failed to make a required interest payment on its 12% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2007 (the 12% Notes). The 30-day grace period for such payment expired on March 18, 2002, resulting in an event of default under the indenture governing the 12% Notes, as well as a cross-default under the Parent's Senior Secured Credit facility (the Amended Credit Agreement). Further, on March 31, 2002, the Parent failed to meet the EBITDA covenant under its Amended Credit Agreement and was in default on its Amended Credit Agreement and its 12% Notes. Subsequently, the Parent did not make the $7.2 million August 15, 2002 required interest payment on its 12% Notes and did not meet the EBITDA covenants under its Amended Credit Agreement for June 30 and September 30, 2002. At September 30, 2002, the Parent continued to operate under these defaults and, therefore, has classified as current, its debt obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 12% Notes and the 14% Senior Discount Notes Due 2008 (the 14% Notes). On May 3, 2002, the Parent and the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement (the Lenders) entered into a forbearance agreement (Forbearance Agreement). Under the Forbearance Agreement, the Lenders agreed that, absent a further default, they would not (a) accelerate the maturity of the debt under the Amended Credit Agreement, (b) take enforcement action against any collateral, including effecting any rights of setoff, or (c) commence any legal action to enforce rights or remedies pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, for the period from May 3, 2002 until July 10, 2002 (the Forbearance Period). This agreement was subsequently amended to extend the Forbearance Period through November 4, 2002. The purpose of the Forbearance Period was to allow the Parent time to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, such as a sale of all or some of the business, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, or other remedies appropriate for the circumstances. To that end, the Parent engaged in active discussions with potential purchasers of substantially all of the assets of its three business segments, including the Passive Components Group, which the Parent anticipates will result in multiple sales of these business segments through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The Parent's recent losses and highly leveraged position raise substantial doubt about the Parent's and the Companies' ability to continue as a going concern. The combined financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Parent and the Companies become unable to continue as a going concern. 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On December 16, 2002, Insilco Holding Co., the parent company of Insilco, Insilco and several of Insilco's subsidiaries, including the Companies, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The debtors continue to manage their properties and operate their businesses as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Code. - 42 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF LNSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) In addition, Insilco Holding Co. completed its review of strategic alternatives for addressing its capital structure issues and its primary operating subsidiary, Insilco, has entered into definitive agreements to sell substantially all of the assets of its three business segments, including the Passive Components Group, for which the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries have agreed to sell to Bel Fuse Ltd. for approximately $35 million. None of Insilco's operations located outside of the United States were included in the Chapter 11 filings, though the shares of certain foreign subsidiaries and certain foreign assets will be included in the sale transactions. The Chapter 11 filings allow the sale of the assets of the domestic entities to be free and clear from certain liabilities that the prospective purchasers do not wish to assume. On January 14, 2003, the Parent notified the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) that a reportable event occurred in regards to the defined benefit pension plan due to the Chapter 11 filing. The Parent intends to terminate the plan as the potential buyers of the various businesses will not sponsor the existing plan. The plan was in an under-funded position of approximately $17 million, on a termination basis, as of December 31, 2002. Management expects the PBGC to take over as trustee of the plan and that the PBGC will make all future benefit payments to the covered employees after such time. - 43 -

BEL FUSE INC. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB) announced today that net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 doubled to $3,630,000, or $0.32 per diluted share, from $1,746,000, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2002. Revenue increased 67% to $45,864,000 compared to $27,401,000 for the same period last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, net earnings increased to $8,167,000, or $0.73 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $1,218,000, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2002. Sales increased 68% to $115,632,000 from $68,642,000 for the same period a year earlier. Daniel Bernstein, President, said, "Our strong sales gains largely reflect the acquisition, last Spring, of the Passive Components Group from Insilco Technologies. Profitability has benefited from operating improvements at the Passive Components Group and the introduction of new products, particularly our expanding line of integrated connector modules. Consequently, Bel's third quarter gross margin improved to 29% of sales compared to 23% for the third quarter last year, and income from operations increased to 12% of sales from 7% of sales in the third quarter last year." At September 30, 2003, Bel reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $52,000,000, working capital of approximately $93,700,000, a current ratio of 5.3-to-1, total term debt of $7,000,000 and shareholders' equity of approximately $140,300,000, or $12.63 per share.

PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - 5 -
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of Insilco Technologies, Inc. In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related combined statements of operations, of equity and comprehensive income (loss) and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the Passive Components Group (the Companies), wholly owned subsidiaries of Insilco Technologies, Inc. (Insilco), at November 1, 2002 and December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their combined operations and their combined cash flows for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of Insilco's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As explained in Note 1, the combined financial statements include certain costs allocated by Insilco that are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would have been recorded by the Companies on a stand-alone basis. As explained in Note 12, there is substantial doubt about Insilco's and the Companies' ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ------------------------------ January 14, 2003 Columbus, Ohio - 6 -

PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The combined financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Passive Components Group for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The Passive Components Group consists of three business units and their subsidiaries (all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Insilco Technologies, Inc.) (Insilco or the Parent): Signal Transformer Co., Inc. (Signal); InNet Technologies, Inc. (InNet), which was purchased on January 10, 2001; and Stewart Connector Systems, Inc. (SCS), herein referred to as Passive Components or the Companies. The Companies' operations consist of the manufacturing and sale of telecommunications and electrical component products. Passive Components is not a separate legal entity and since no direct ownership in the Companies as a combined group exists, Insilco's net investment and advances in the Companies is shown in lieu of stockholder's equity in the combined financial statements and includes the accumulation of transactions between the Companies and Insilco described below. All intercompany accounts and transactions amongst the Passive Components Group have been eliminated. Sales to other subsidiaries of Insilco were approximately $45,000 for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and $20,000 and $41,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable. However, the combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows presented herein may not be the same as would have occurred had the Companies operated as stand-alone entities during the periods presented and may not be indicative of future financial results. INTERCOMPANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARENT The combined financial statements include allocations of Insilco's corporate overhead, executive management and administrative expenses amounting to $1.2 million for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and $2.0 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which are included in the Allocated corporate costs line in the statement of operations. These allocations include the general administrative expenses of Insilco's corporate office, such as accounting, information technology, human resources, legal, environmental, treasury, and tax. As specific identification of these expenses was not practical, allocations were charged based on a formula factoring in the ratio of the Companies' forecasted annual sales, forecasted assets, and actual number of employees in proportion to Insilco's consolidated numbers for these categories. The resulting ratio was applied to Insilco's forecasted corporate expenses and allocated to the Companies rateably over each year. Insilco's management believes that this allocation method is reasonable, however, the allocations do not necessarily represent what the Companies would have incurred on a stand-alone basis. As the Companies were operated in a decentralized manner with their own administrative infrastructure, and the Companies would likely make different decisions regarding administrative initiatives, their overhead expenses as a separate company would be different than that reflected in the combined financial statements. - 11 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Companies' combined financial statements also include allocations of Insilco's interest expense totalling $2.8 million for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and $7.1 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which are included in the Allocated interest expense line in the statement of operations. Interest expense has been allocated generally based on the Companies' net assets in proportion to Insilco's consolidated net assets. The interest rate applied was 10.0% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, which represents an estimated weighted average cost of capital. The amounts used to calculate interest expense do not necessarily reflect the level of indebtedness the Companies would incur as a separate entity. Insilco's management believes these are reasonable estimates of the cost of financing the Companies' assets and operations in the past. However, the Companies may not be able to obtain financing at interest rates similar to those used for the interest expense calculation. Accordingly, the Companies' interest expense and financing costs as a separate entity may be different than that reflected in the combined financial statements. Insilco uses a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations. The Companies' cash accounts are swept on a daily basis and are netted against the net investment and advances account. As a result, none of Insilco's cash, cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level has been allocated to the Companies in the combined financial statements, other than the $25 million portion of the credit facility drawn specifically to fund the acquisition of InNet in 2001. Cash in the combined financial statements primarily represents amounts held locally by the Companies' operations in their various geographic areas. ACQUISITION On January 10, 2001, Insilco acquired the outstanding equity interests in InNet, excluding approximately 16% of the outstanding equity interests that Insilco already owned. InNet, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Insilco, is a California-based designer, developer and marketer of a broad range of magnetic interface products for networking, computer and telecommunications original equipment manufacturers. The gross purchase price paid for the remaining equity interests was $44.9 million and was financed with cash and additional borrowings of $25.0 million under the Parent's credit facility. The purchase method of accounting has been used to account for the purchase; accordingly, the results of operations of InNet have been included in the Companies' combined financial statements from January 10, 2001. The purchase price, net of cash acquired and including costs incurred directly related to the transaction, was $44.2 million. The excess of the purchase price over identifiable assets acquired was $37.9 million, which was being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. InNet subsequently evaluated the recoverability of the goodwill and recorded a pretax impairment charge of $35.1 million in 2001. For further discussion, see Note 11, Impairment of Goodwill. - 12 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents include time deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $1.8 million, $1.5 million and $1.2 million at November 1, 2002, December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is generally determined using the first-in, first-out cost method. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives, which is 25 years for new buildings and ranges from 3 to 9 years for machinery and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management's plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS Deferred financing costs are being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the related debt. Deferred financing costs were $1,134,000, $1,313,000 and $749,000, net of accumulated amortization of approximately $528,000, $289,000 and $45,000 at November 1, 2002 and December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization expense was approximately $239,000 for the period ended November 1, 2002, $244,000 in 2001 and $45,000 in 2000. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers. Provisions for returns and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of the Companies' foreign subsidiaries are translated at the balance sheet date exchange rates and statement of operations accounts are translated at the average rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of equity. - 13 -

Liabilities are recorded when it is probable the obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate book value at November 1, 2002, December 31, 2001 and 2000. Due to the situation described in Notes 12 and 13, management is not able to make a fair determination of the fair value of the debt. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Companies are subject to concentration of credit risk relating to cash and equivalents. The Companies maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions. The Companies monitor the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limit the amounts of credit exposure with any one entity. The Companies also monitor the creditworthiness of the entities to which they grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The Companies are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companies' combined revenues in 2002, 2001 or 2000. INCOME TAXES Passive Components is not a separate tax paying entity. Passive Components is included in Insilco's combined federal and certain state income tax groups for income tax reporting purposes and is responsible for its proportionate share of income taxes calculated upon its federal taxable income at a current estimate of the annual effective tax rate. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse. Determination of the amount of valuation allowance recognized is based upon an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the combined statements of equity and comprehensive income (loss). - 14 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATES In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and, therefore, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Statement No. 146 eliminates the definition and requirement for recognition of exit costs in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 where a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Companies believe that the adoption of this statement will not have a significant impact on the results of operations or financial position. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to the guarantor's accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. This interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of certain types of guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor's fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Companies are assessing the impact the adoption of this interpretation will have on the results of operations or financial position. - 15 -

ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES A summary of accrued expenses and other current liabilities at November 1, 2002 and December 31, 2001 and 2000 follows (in thousands): 6. LONG-TERM DEBT On January 10, 2001, Insilco increased its credit facility by $25.0 million to fund the acquisition of InNet. This debt is reflected in the combined balance sheets of the Companies at December 31, 2001 and November 1, 2002. The related interest expense, deferred financing costs, amortization expense and accumulated amortization have also been reflected on the combined balance sheets and combined statements of operations of the Companies. The outstanding balance under the credit facility is subject to twenty-three mandatory quarterly payments of $62,500 and two payments of $11,781,250 in each of year six and seven. Interest accrues under the credit facility at floating rates calculated with respect to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Bank One's Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The margin, in turn, fluctuates based on Insilco's debt covenant ratios. LIBOR at November 1, 2002 was 1.66%. At November 1, 2002, the applicable margin for the credit facility was LIBOR plus 4.5%. The credit facilities of the Parent are guaranteed by all of Insilco's subsidiaries, including the Companies. In addition, the obligations thereunder are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Companies. The credit facility contains certain financial covenants including, but not limited to, covenants related to minimum EBITDA, maximum debt and a limit on annual capital expenditures. The credit facility also contains certain negative covenants typical of credit agreements of this type including, but not limited to, a prohibition on the ability of Insilco and its domestic subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness in excess of certain agreed upon amounts, and to make investments other than permitted investments, and also restricts Insilco and its subsidiaries from paying any - 17 -

BENEFIT PLANS Certain Signal and SCS employees participate in Insilco's defined benefit pension plans. The benefits under these plans are based primarily on employees' years of service and compensation near retirement. The Companies' funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and regulations. The net periodic pension cost allocated to the Companies associated with Insilco's defined benefit pension plans was $164,000 during the ten months ended November 1, 2002, $127,000 during 2001 and $(71,000) during 2000. Signal also contributes to a multi-employer plan sponsored by a bargaining unit for its union employees. Signal recognized expenses of $201,000 during the ten months ended November 1, 2002, $295,000 in 2001, and $313,000 in 2000 related to contributions to this multi-employer plan. In addition to the defined benefit plans described above, Signal and SCS employees may participate in a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan sponsored by Insilco, which covers substantially all nonunion employees of the Companies and their subsidiaries, and which covers union employees at one of the Companies' subsidiaries. The Companies match 50% of participants' voluntary contributions up to a maximum of 3% of each participant's eligible compensation, subject to limitations required by government laws or regulations. The Companies' expense related to this plan was approximately $76,000 during the ten months ended November 1, 2002, and $119,000 and $174,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. InNet sponsors a SIMPLE IRA plan for its employees. InNet's contributions to this plan on behalf of its employees were $36,000 during the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and $37,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. - 18 -

In 2002, current taxes were provided on the earnings of those foreign subsidiaries because it is expected that the earnings will not be permanently reinvested due to financial obligations of Insilco. At November 1, 2002, the Companies had net operating loss carryforwards for Federal tax purposes of $20.9 million, which will begin to expire in 2022. Insilco and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. 9. RESTRUCTURING AND PLANT CLOSING COSTS During the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and the year ended December 31, 2001, the Companies recorded $1,744,000 and $181,000, respectively, of restructuring and plant closing costs relating to the closure of facilities in New York and the Dominican Republic and a sales office located in Japan. These closings were under taken to reduce operating costs. During 2001, the Companies paid approximately $181,000 related to these restructuring charges. There were no charges during 2000. - 21 -

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All of these costs have been reflected in the Restructuring charge line item on the combined statements of operations. As of November 1, 2002, the Companies had an accrual of $1,728,000 relating to these restructuring charges, which is included in accrued expenses on the balance sheet. A summary of this accrual is as follows (in thousands): The headcount reduction from these activities was approximately 73 employees. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Rental expense for operating leases totaled $1.2 million, $2.0 million, and $824,000 for the ten months ended November 1, 2002 and the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These leases primarily relate to production facilities. Future minimum lease payments under contractually noncancelable operating leases (with initial lease terms in excess of one year) for years subsequent to November 1, 2002 are as follows (in thousands): The Companies are subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Companies accrue for amounts related to legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable. No amounts were accrued related to legal matters at November 1, 2002, December 31, 2001 or 2000. The Companies' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials - 22 -

The Companies have a program for monitoring its compliance with applicable environmental regulations, the interpretation of which often is subjective. The Companies have taken significant measures to (1) address emissions, discharges and waste generation and disposal, (2) improve management practices and operations in response to legal requirements, and (3) internally review compliance with applicable environmental regulations and approved practices. In order to achieve these goals, the Companies have instituted several programs including (1) raw material and process substitution, recycling and material management, (2) periodic review of hazardous waste storage and disposal practices, and (3) review of compliance and financial status and management practices of our offsite third-party waste management firms. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of the matters discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on the Companies' combined financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 11. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL During the first half of 2001, the Companies experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth due to a dramatic decline in capital spending in the telecommunications industry. During the second quarter of 2001, major customers further reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed. Management believed that the growth prospects for these business segments were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods. The Companies review the value of their long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may be impaired. As a result of the business conditions noted above, Insilco concluded such a review was required for its recent acquisition of InNet, acquired in January 2001, and the related goodwill. The review was completed in a series of tests. The first test included the following steps: (1) management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset based on estimated growth levels; (2) management estimated the terminal value of the asset based on an appropriate multiple of EBITDA; and (3) management compared the sum of the future cash flows and terminal value to the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if an impairment has occurred. If an impairment had occurred, management performed a second test as follows: (1) management discounted the future cash flows and terminal value, using EBITDA as a proxy for cash flow, to a present value using an appropriate discount rate; and (2) management compared the discounted net present value to the carrying value of long lived assets to determine the amount of the impairment. As a result of this review, management determined that the goodwill related to the acquisition of InNet was impaired and, in accordance with Insilco's policy it was necessary to write down the goodwill. Thus in 2001, InNet recorded a pretax impairment charge of $35.1 million. - 23 -

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. GOING CONCERN MATTERS On February 15, 2002, the Parent failed to make a required interest payment on its 12% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2007 (the 12% Notes). The 30-day grace period for such payment expired on March 18, 2002, resulting in an event of default under the indenture governing the 12% Notes, as well as a cross-default under the Parent's Senior Secured Credit facility (the Amended Credit Agreement). Further, on March 31, 2002, the Parent failed to meet the EBITDA covenant under its Amended Credit Agreement and was in default on its Amended Credit Agreement and its 12% Notes. Subsequently, the Parent did not make the $7.2 million August 15, 2002 required interest payment on its 12% Notes and did not meet the EBITDA covenants under its Amended Credit Agreement for June 30 and September 30, 2002. At September 30, 2002, the Parent continued to operate under these defaults and, therefore, has classified as current, its debt obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 12% Notes and the 14% Senior Discount Notes Due 2008 (the 14% Notes). On May 3, 2002, the Parent and the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement (the Lenders) entered into a forbearance agreement (Forbearance Agreement). Under the Forbearance Agreement, the Lenders agreed that, absent a further default, they would not (a) accelerate the maturity of the debt under the Amended Credit Agreement, (b) take enforcement action against any collateral, including effecting any rights of setoff, or (c) commence any legal action to enforce rights or remedies pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, for the period from May 3, 2002 until July 10, 2002 (the Forbearance Period). This agreement was subsequently amended to extend the Forbearance Period through November 4, 2002. The purpose of the Forbearance Period was to allow the Parent time to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, such as a sale of all or some of the business, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, or other remedies appropriate for the circumstances. To that end, the Parent engaged in active discussions with potential purchasers of substantially all of the assets of its three business segments, including the Passive Components Group, which the Parent anticipates will result in multiple sales of these business segments through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The Parent's recent losses and highly leveraged position raise substantial doubt about the Parent's and the Companies' ability to continue as a going concern. The combined financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Parent and the Companies become unable to continue as a going concern. 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On December 16, 2002, Insilco Holding Co., the parent company of Insilco, Insilco and several of Insilco's subsidiaries, including the Companies, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The debtors continue to manage their properties and operate their businesses as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Code. - 24 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, Insilco Holding Co. completed its review of strategic alternatives for addressing its capital structure issues and its primary operating subsidiary, Insilco, has entered into definitive agreements to sell substantially all of the assets of its three business segments, including the Passive Components Group, for which the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries have agreed to sell to Bel Fuse Ltd. for approximately $35 million. None of Insilco's operations located outside of the United States were included in the Chapter 11 filings, though the shares of certain foreign subsidiaries and certain foreign assets will be included in the sale transactions. The Chapter 11 filings allow the sale of the assets of the domestic entities to be free and clear from certain liabilities that the prospective purchasers do not wish to assume. On January 14, 2003, the Parent notified the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) that a reportable event occurred in regards to the defined benefit pension plan due to the Chapter 11 filing. The Parent intends to terminate the plan as the potential buyers of the various businesses will not sponsor the existing plan. The plan was in an under-funded position of approximately $17 million, on a termination basis, as of December 31, 2002. Management expects the PBGC to take over as trustee of the plan and that the PBGC will make all future benefit payments to the covered employees after such time. - 25 -

PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The combined financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Passive Components Group for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Passive Components Group consists of three business units and their subsidiaries (all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Insilco Technologies, Inc.) (Insilco or the Parent): Signal Transformer Co., Inc. (Signal); InNet Technologies, Inc. (InNet), which was purchased on January 10, 2001; and Stewart Connector Systems, Inc. (SCS), herein referred to as Passive Components or the Companies. The Companies' operations consist of the manufacturing and sale of telecommunications and electrical component products. Passive Components is not a separate legal entity and since no direct ownership in the Companies as a combined group exists, Insilco's net investment and advances in the Companies is shown in lieu of stockholder's equity in the combined financial statements and includes the accumulation of transactions between the Companies and Insilco described below. All intercompany accounts and transactions amongst the Passive Components Group have been eliminated. Sales to other subsidiaries of Insilco were approximately $28,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable. However, the combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows presented herein may not be the same as would have occurred had the Companies operated as stand-alone entities during the period presented and may not be indicative of future financial results. INTERCOMPANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARENT The combined financial statements include allocations of Insilco's corporate overhead, executive management and administrative expenses amounting to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,, which are included in the Allocated corporate costs line in the statement of operations. These allocations include the general administrative expenses of Insilco's corporate office, such as accounting, information technology, human resources, legal, environmental, treasury, and tax. As specific identification of these expenses was not practical, allocations were charged based on a formula factoring in the ratio of the Companies' forecasted annual sales, forecasted assets, and actual number of employees in proportion to Insilco's consolidated numbers for these categories. The resulting ratio was applied to Insilco's forecasted corporate expenses and allocated to the Companies rateably for the year. Insilco's management believes that this allocation method is reasonable, however, the allocations do not necessarily represent what the Companies would have incurred on a stand-alone basis. As the Companies were operated in a decentralized manner with their own administrative infrastructure, and the Companies would likely make different decisions regarding administrative initiatives, their overhead expenses as a separate company would be different than that reflected in the combined financial statements. - 29 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) The Companies' combined financial statements also include allocations of Insilco's interest expense totaling $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, which are included in the Allocated interest expense line in the statement of operations. Interest expense has been allocated generally based on the Companies' net assets in proportion to Insilco's consolidated net assets. The interest rate applied was 10.0%, which represents an estimated weighted average cost of capital. The amounts used to calculate interest expense do not necessarily reflect the level of indebtedness the Companies would incur as a separate entity. Insilco's management believes these are reasonable estimates of the cost of financing the Companies' assets and operations in the past. However, the Companies may not be able to obtain financing at interest rates similar to those used for the interest expense calculation. Accordingly, the Companies' interest expense and financing costs as a separate entity may be different than that reflected in the combined financial statements. Insilco uses a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations. The Companies' cash accounts are swept on a daily basis and are netted against the net investment and advances account. As a result, none of Insilco's cash, cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level has been allocated to the Companies in the combined financial statements, other than the $25 million portion of the credit facility drawn specifically to fund the acquisition of InNet in 2001. Cash in the combined financial statements primarily represents amounts held locally by the Companies' operations in their various geographic areas. ACQUISITION On January 10, 2001, Insilco acquired the outstanding equity interests in InNet, excluding approximately 16% of the outstanding equity interests that Insilco already owned. InNet, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Insilco, is a California-based designer, developer and marketer of a broad range of magnetic interface products for networking, computer and telecommunications original equipment manufacturers. The gross purchase price paid for the remaining equity interests was $44.9 million and was financed with cash and additional borrowings of $25.0 million under the Parent's credit facility. The purchase method of accounting has been used to account for the purchase; accordingly, the results of operations of InNet have been included in the Companies' combined financial statements from January 10, 2001. The purchase price, net of cash acquired and including costs incurred directly related to the transaction, was $44.2 million. The excess of the purchase price over identifiable assets acquired was $37.9 million, which was being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. InNet subsequently evaluated the recoverability of the goodwill and recorded a pretax impairment charge of $35.l million in 2001. For further discussion, see Note 11, Impairment of Goodwill. - 30 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF LNSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents include time deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $1.7 million at December 31, 2002. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is generally determined using the first-in, first-out cost method. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives, which is 25 years for new buildings and ranges from 3 to 9 years for machinery and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management's plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS Deferred financing costs are being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the related debt. Amortization expense was approximately $1,373,000 for 2002 which includes a $1,098,000 write off of the remaining balance during December 2002. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers. Provisions for returns and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of the Companies' foreign subsidiaries are translated at the balance sheet date exchange rates and statement of operations accounts are translated at the average rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of equity. - 31 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND COMPLIANCE Environmental remediation and compliance expenditures are expensed or capitalized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Liabilities are recorded when it is probable the obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate book value at December 31, 2002. Due to the situation described in Notes 12 and 13, management is not able to make a fair determination of the fair value of the debt. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Companies are subject to concentration of credit risk relating to cash and equivalents. The Companies maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions. The Companies monitor the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limit the amounts of credit exposure with any one entity. The Companies also monitor the creditworthiness of the entities to which they grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The Companies are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companies' combined revenues in 2002. INCOME TAXES Passive Components is not a separate tax paying entity. Passive Components is included in Insilco's combined federal and certain state income tax groups for income tax reporting purposes and is responsible for its proportionate share of income taxes calculated upon its federal taxable income at a current estimate of the annual effective tax rate. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse. Determination of the amount of valuation allowance recognized is based upon an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the combined statements of equity and comprehensive income (loss). - 32 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF LNSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) ESTIMATES In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and, therefore, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Statement No. 146 eliminates the definition and requirement for recognition of exit costs in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 where a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Companies believe that the adoption of this statement will not have a significant impact on the results of operations or financial position. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FA SB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to the guarantor's accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. This interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of certain types of guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor's fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Companies are assessing the impact the adoption of this interpretation will have on the results of operations or financial position. - 33 -

LONG-TERM DEBT On January 10, 2001, Insilco increased its credit facility by $25.0 million to fund the acquisition of InNet. This debt is reflected in the combined balance sheet of the Companies at December 31, 2002. The related interest expense, deferred financing costs, amortization expense and accumulated amortization have also been reflected on the combined balance sheets and combined statements of operations of the Companies. The outstanding balance under the credit facility is subject to twenty-three mandatory quarterly payments of $62,500 and two payments of $l1,781,250 in each of year six and seven. Interest accrues under the credit facility at floating rates calculated with respect to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Bank One's Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The margin, in turn, fluctuates based on Insilco's debt covenant ratios. LIBOR at December 31, 2002 was 1.45%. At December 31, 2002, the applicable margin for the credit facility was LJBOR plus 4.5%. The credit facilities of the Parent are guaranteed by all of Insilco's subsidiaries, including the Companies. In addition, the obligations thereunder are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Companies. The credit facility contains certain financial covenants including, but not limited to, covenants related to minimum EBITDA, maximum debt and a limit on annual capital expenditures. The credit facility also contains certain negative covenants typical of credit agreements of this type including, but not limited to, a prohibition on the ability of Insilco and its domestic subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness in excess of certain agreed upon amounts, and to make investments other than permitted investments, and also restricts Insilco and its subsidiaries from paying any - 35 -

As a result of the situation described in Notes 12 and 13, the outstanding debt obligation under the credit facility has been classified as current. 7. BENEFIT PLANS Certain Signal and SCS employees participate in Insilco's defined benefit pension plans. The benefits under these plans are based primarily on employees' years of service and compensation near retirement. The Companies' funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and regulations. The net periodic pension cost allocated to the Companies associated with Insilco's defined benefit pension plans was $213,000 during 2002. Signal also contributes to a multi-employer plan sponsored by a bargaining unit for its union employees. Signal recognized expenses of $249,000 in 2002 related to contributions to this multi-employer plan. In addition to the defined benefit plans described above, Signal and SCS employees may participate in a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan sponsored by lnsilco, which covers substantially all nonunion employees of the Companies and their subsidiaries, and which covers union employees at one of the Companies' subsidiaries. The Companies match 50% of participants' voluntary contributions up to a maximum of 3% of each participant's eligible compensation, subject to limitations required by government laws or regulations. The Companies' expense related to this plan was approximately $79,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. InNet sponsors a SIMPLE IRA plan for its employees. InNet's contributions to this plan on behalf of its employees were $42,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. - 36 -

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) The tax effects of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset by valuation allowances resulting in no net deferred tax assets or liabilities. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities follows (in thousands): In 2002, current taxes were provided on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is expected that the earnings will not be permanently reinvested due to financial obligations of Insilco. At December 31, 2002, the Companies had net operating loss carryforwards for Federal tax purposes of $20.9 million, which will begin to expire in 2022. Insilco and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. 9. RESTRUCTURING AND PLANT CLOSING COSTS During the years ended December 31, 2002, the Companies recorded $1,744,000 of restructuring and plant closing costs relating to the closure of facilities in New York and the Dominican Republic and a sales office located in Japan. These closings were under taken to reduce operating costs. All of these costs have been reflected in the Restructuring charge line item on the combined statements of operations. As of December 31, 2002, the Companies had an accrual of $l,728,000 relating to these restructuring charges, which is included in accrued expenses on the balance sheet. A summary of this accrual is as follows (in thousands): The headcount reduction from these activities was approximately 73 employees. - 39 -

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Rental expense for operating leases totaled $l.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2002. These leases primarily relate to production facilities. Future minimum lease payments under contractually noncancelable operating leases (with initial lease terms in excess of one year) for years subsequent to December 31, 2002 are as follows (in thousands): 2003 $1,050 2004 540 2005 269 2006 177 2007 -- Thereafter -- The Companies are subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Companies accrue for amounts related to legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable. No amounts were accrued related to legal matters at December 31, 2002. The Companies' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. The Companies have a program for monitoring its compliance with applicable environmental regulations, the interpretation of which often is subjective. The Companies have taken significant measures to (1) address emissions, discharges and waste generation and disposal, (2) improve management practices and operations in response to legal requirements, and (3) internally review compliance with applicable environmental regulations and approved practices. In order to achieve these goals, the Companies have instituted several programs including (1) raw material and process substitution, recycling and material management, (2) periodic review of hazardous waste storage and disposal practices, and (3) review of compliance and financial status and management practices of our offsite third-party waste management firms. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of the matters discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on the Companies' combined financial position, results of operations or liquidity. - 40 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF LNSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) 11. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL During the first half of 2001, the Companies experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth due to a dramatic decline in capital spending in the telecommunications industry. During the second quarter of 2001, major customers further reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed. Management believed that the growth prospects for these business segments were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods. The Companies review the value of their long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may be impaired. As a result of the business conditions noted above, Insilco concluded such a review was required for its recent acquisition of InNet, acquired in January 2001, and the related goodwill. The review was completed in a series of tests. The first test included the following steps: (1) management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset based on estimated growth levels; (2) management estimated the terminal value of the asset based on an appropriate multiple of EBITDA; and (3) management compared the sum of the future cash flows and terminal value to the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if an impairment has occurred. If an impairment had occurred, management performed a second test as follows: (1) management discounted the future cash flows and terminal value, using EBITDA as a proxy for cash flow, to a present value using an appropriate discount rate; and (2) management compared the discounted net present value to the carrying value of long lived assets to determine the amount of the impairment. As a result of this review, management determined that the goodwill related to the acquisition of InNet was impaired and, in accordance with Insilco's policy it was necessary to write down the goodwill. Thus in 2001, InNet recorded a pretax impairment charge of $35.1 million. - 41 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF INSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) 12. GOING CONCERN MATTERS On February 15, 2002, the Parent failed to make a required interest payment on its 12% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2007 (the 12% Notes). The 30-day grace period for such payment expired on March 18, 2002, resulting in an event of default under the indenture governing the 12% Notes, as well as a cross-default under the Parent's Senior Secured Credit facility (the Amended Credit Agreement). Further, on March 31, 2002, the Parent failed to meet the EBITDA covenant under its Amended Credit Agreement and was in default on its Amended Credit Agreement and its 12% Notes. Subsequently, the Parent did not make the $7.2 million August 15, 2002 required interest payment on its 12% Notes and did not meet the EBITDA covenants under its Amended Credit Agreement for June 30 and September 30, 2002. At September 30, 2002, the Parent continued to operate under these defaults and, therefore, has classified as current, its debt obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the 12% Notes and the 14% Senior Discount Notes Due 2008 (the 14% Notes). On May 3, 2002, the Parent and the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement (the Lenders) entered into a forbearance agreement (Forbearance Agreement). Under the Forbearance Agreement, the Lenders agreed that, absent a further default, they would not (a) accelerate the maturity of the debt under the Amended Credit Agreement, (b) take enforcement action against any collateral, including effecting any rights of setoff, or (c) commence any legal action to enforce rights or remedies pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, for the period from May 3, 2002 until July 10, 2002 (the Forbearance Period). This agreement was subsequently amended to extend the Forbearance Period through November 4, 2002. The purpose of the Forbearance Period was to allow the Parent time to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, such as a sale of all or some of the business, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, or other remedies appropriate for the circumstances. To that end, the Parent engaged in active discussions with potential purchasers of substantially all of the assets of its three business segments, including the Passive Components Group, which the Parent anticipates will result in multiple sales of these business segments through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The Parent's recent losses and highly leveraged position raise substantial doubt about the Parent's and the Companies' ability to continue as a going concern. The combined financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Parent and the Companies become unable to continue as a going concern. 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On December 16, 2002, Insilco Holding Co., the parent company of Insilco, Insilco and several of Insilco's subsidiaries, including the Companies, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The debtors continue to manage their properties and operate their businesses as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Code. - 42 -
PASSIVE COMPONENTS GROUP (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF LNSILCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.) NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2002 (Unaudited) In addition, Insilco Holding Co. completed its review of strategic alternatives for addressing its capital structure issues and its primary operating subsidiary, Insilco, has entered into definitive agreements to sell substantially all of the assets of its three business segments, including the Passive Components Group, for which the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries have agreed to sell to Bel Fuse Ltd. for approximately $35 million. None of Insilco's operations located outside of the United States were included in the Chapter 11 filings, though the shares of certain foreign subsidiaries and certain foreign assets will be included in the sale transactions. The Chapter 11 filings allow the sale of the assets of the domestic entities to be free and clear from certain liabilities that the prospective purchasers do not wish to assume. On January 14, 2003, the Parent notified the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) that a reportable event occurred in regards to the defined benefit pension plan due to the Chapter 11 filing. The Parent intends to terminate the plan as the potential buyers of the various businesses will not sponsor the existing plan. The plan was in an under-funded position of approximately $17 million, on a termination basis, as of December 31, 2002. Management expects the PBGC to take over as trustee of the plan and that the PBGC will make all future benefit payments to the covered employees after such time. - 43 -

BEL FUSE INC. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB) today announced higher preliminary and unaudited revenue and net earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS For the fourth quarter of 2003, revenue increased 59% to $42,865,000 from $26,886,000 for the fourth quarter of 2002. Net earnings increased to $5,597,000, or $0.49 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $639,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier. 2003 RESULTS For 2003, revenue increased 66% to $158,498,000 from $95,528,000 for 2002. Net earnings increased to $13,764,000, or $1.23 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $579,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, for 2002. The Company cautions that its fourth quarter and year end results are preliminary and unaudited. OPERATIONS REVIEW President Daniel Bernstein said that the acquisition of the Passive Components Group from Insilco Technologies completed last spring was primarily responsible for the increase in revenue for the fourth quarter and 2003 compared to the comparable prior-year periods. He said that the implementation of operating enhancements at the Passive Components Group contributed to the increase in profitability, as did the launch of Bel's new integrated connector modules and other new products during 2003. At December 31, 2003, Bel had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $62,500,000, working capital of approximately $101,000,000, a current ratio of 6-to-1, total long-term debt of $6,500,000 and shareholders' equity of approximately $146,855,000.

This compares to net earnings of $1,780,000, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, July 26, 2004 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
announced today that net income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004 increased to $7,145,000, or $0.62 per diluted share. Net income for the quarter included net proceeds of $2,395,000 from the settlement of a lawsuit and a fixed asset write down of $1,033,000. The net effect of this settlement and writedown was to increase Bel's net earnings on an after-tax basis by $0.12 per diluted share. For the second quarter of 2003, net income was $2,757,000, or $0.25 per diluted share. Gross margin improved to 31% of revenue from 27% for the second quarter of 2003. Revenue increased to $48,390,000 from $44,821,000 for the same period a year ago.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, net income increased to $11,800,000, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $4,538,000, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the first half of 2003. Revenue increased 30% to $90,747,000 from $69,769,000 for last year's first six months. First half results reflect the contribution of Insilco since its acquisition on March 24, 2003.
 
"Second quarter revenue increased 8% compared to the last year's second quarter and was 14% ahead of this year's first quarter, reflecting sales gains across all of our product lines, led by MagJack
integrated connectors with magnetics. Even without the benefit of the legal settlement, Bel had a strong quarter, with increased profitability fueled primarily by higher gross margin and lower selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the second quarter of 2003," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's president.
 
At June 30, 2004, Bel reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $76,324,000, working capital of approximately $119,726,000, a current ratio of 6-to-1, total long term debt of $5,500,000 and shareholders' equity of approximately $160,758,000.

integrated connectors with magnetics for the consumer electronic market plus gains in the power products group," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's president and CEO.
 
Bernstein also said, "Bel has not increased its holding in Artesyn Technologies Inc. from the position we disclosed in the 13D that we filed on September 9,2004. All unrealized gains on the increase in Artesyn Technologies' stock price are reflected in Bel's balance sheet and are not reflected in Bel's reported profit." Bernstein added, "The Board of Artesyn continues to refuse to meet with Bel to discuss the possible merger."
 
At September 30, 2004, Bel reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $87,232,000, working capital of approximately $129,107,000, a current ratio of 5.5-to-1, total long term debt of $5,000,000 and stockholders' equity of approximately $170,838,000

Inventory Report
) which (i) details, for each type of Raw Material, WIP and FG, the number, amount and/or weight, as applicable, of items of such type identified on the Inventory Certificates, (ii) sets forth the agreed upon per-item values set forth in

Cash Amount
), (B) its prepaid assets as of the Closing Date (the 
Prepaid Assets Amount
) and (C) its current liabilities as of the Closing Date (the 
Liabilities Amount
), in each case determined in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements. The sum of the estimated Accounts Receivable Amount
plus
the Closing RM/WIP/FG Amount
plus
the Cash Amount
plus
the Prepaid Assets Amount and
minus
the Liabilities Amount, as set forth in the Estimated Closing Report, shall be referred to herein as the 
Estimated Working Capital Amount
. The Estimated Working Capital Amount shall be calculated in the same manner as the Benchmark Working Capital Amount, which is calculated as shown on
Schedule 1.7(c)
attached hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Liabilities Amount shall include any and all amounts (i) due and owing to any former employees of the Company pursuant to chapter 149, section 183 of the Massachusetts General Laws to the extent arising from the termination of such employees employment with the Company prior to the Closing; (ii) due and owing to Howard Kaepplein to the extent arising from the termination of his employment (whether resulting from obligations under that certain Employment Severance Agreement dated as of March 31, 2004 by and between Howard Kaepplein and the Company or otherwise); and (iii) required to be expended in order to obtain all those
software licenses necessary to operate the Business in the manner in which it is currently being operated and in compliance with applicable Law

Adjustment at Closing

Benchmark Working Capital Amount
), the Cash Merger Proceeds shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by an amount equal to the difference (the 
Negative Amount
) between the Benchmark Working Capital Amount and the Estimated Working Capital Amount. In the event that the Estimated Working Capital Amount is greater than the Benchmark Working Capital Amount, the Cash Merger Proceeds shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by an amount equal to the difference (the 
Positive Amount
) between the Estimated Working Capital Amount and the Benchmark Working Capital Amount. The amount equal to the Cash Merger Proceeds
plus
the Positive Amount or
minus
the Negative Amount, whichever is applicable, shall be referred to as the 
Adjusted Closing Cash Merger Proceeds
.
 
(e)
 
Post-Closing Adjustmen
t. Concurrently with the delivery of the Estimated Closing Report, the Company shall deliver such documentation and work papers as the Company used to prepare the calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing Report. In the event the Parent disputes the actual sum of the Accounts Receivable Amount
plus
the Closing RM/WIP/FG Amount
plus
the Cash Amount
plus
the Prepaid Assets Amount and
minus
the Liabilities Amount as of the Effective Date (the 
Actual Working Capital Amount
) as shown on the Estimated Closing Report, the Parent shall, within sixty (60) days after the Closing, advise the Stockholder Representative in writing of any objections the Parent may have with respect to the Estimated Closing Report (any such objection shall (i) be set forth in reasonable detail, (ii) include supporting calculations and documentation (if necessary) and (iii) propose an adjustment to the Estimated Working Capital Amount) (a 
WC Objection
). In the event the Parent fails to deliver to the Stockholder Representative a WC Objection within such sixty (60) day period, the Parent shall be deemed to have accepted and consented to the calculations and determinations made in the Estimated Closing Report and the calculation of the Estimated Working Capital Amount contained in the Estimated Closing Report shall be deemed to be final (the 
Final Working Capital Amount
). In the event the Parent delivers a WC Objection within sixty (60) days after the Closing, the Stockholder Representative and the Parent shall utilize commercially reasonable efforts to try to resolve the objections set forth in the WC Objection (the 
Disputed Items
) within sixty (60) days of the Stockholder Representatives receipt of a WC Objection. If the parties are unable to resolve the Parents objections within that period, either party may refer the Disputed Items to the Boston office of Ernst & Young or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to serve, the parties shall engage the Boston office of another internationally known, mutually acceptable accounting firm (the 
Arbiter
) to determine how the Disputed Items should be resolved. By execution of this Agreement, each of the Parent and the Company hereby represents and warrants to the other that Ernst & Young has not performed any services for such party at any time during the five (5) year period immediately preceding the date hereof. The Arbiter shall determine (i) the Actual Working Capital Amount based solely upon
 
-8-
the provisions of this Agreement and the presentations by the parties and their respective representatives, and not by independent review, and (ii) the appropriate amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital Amount should be adjusted as a result of the manner in which the Company calculated the Disputed Items in preparing the Estimated Closing Report. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Arbiter (i) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth in the WC Objection, (ii) shall further limit its review to whether the calculations are mathematically accurate and have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and (iii) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by a party hereto or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by a party hereto. The determinations of the Arbiter shall be final, conclusive and binding (also, the 
Final Working Capital Amount
). The fees and expenses of the Arbiter shall be shared equally between the Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders, on the one hand, the Parent on the other hand, with the Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders portion of such expenses being payable from the WC/Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. On the fifteenth day following the date on which the Final Working Capital Amount is determined, (i) in the event that the Final Working Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Working Capital Amount, the Parent shall deliver to the Company Stockholders and the Company Optionholders their Pro Rata Portion of the amount equal to the difference between (y) the Final Actual Working Capital Amount and (z) the Estimated Working Capital Amount and (ii) in the event that the Final Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Working Capital Amount, the Parent shall be entitled to receive from the WC/Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement an amount equal to the difference between (y) the Estimated Working Capital Amount and (z) the Final Actual Working Capital Amount.
 
Section 1.8.
 
Disposition of the Exchange Fund
.

None of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent or the Company shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock or Eligible Company Options or Company Warrants for any such cash held in the Exchange Fund or in escrow hereunder which is delivered to a public official pursuant to an official request under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

Stockholder Representative
). By virtue of (i) the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (or by written consent in lieu of a meeting) pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the MBCA, each Company Stockholder (regardless of whether or not such Company Stockholder votes in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by written consent) and (ii) each Company Optionholders or Company Warrant Holders receipt of the Adjusted Option/Warrant Per Share Closing Amount, each Company Optionholder and Company Warrant Holder, shall be deemed to agree as follows:
 
(i)
 
the Parent, the Acquirer and the Surviving Corporation shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Stockholder Representative (acting by the majority) as to any actions required or permitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative hereunder, and no party hereunder shall have any cause of action against the Parent, the Acquirer and/or the Surviving Corporation to the extent the Parent, the Acquirer and/or the Surviving Corporation has relied upon the instructions or decisions of the Stockholder Representative;

all actions, decisions and instructions of the Stockholder Representative shall be based on a majority vote of the individuals serving in the capacity of a Stockholder Representative and any and all such actions, decisions and instructions approved by a majority of the individuals serving as a Stockholder Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and Company Warrant Holders, and no Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or Company Warrant Holder shall have any cause of action against the Stockholder Representative for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement (or for any failure to take such action, make such decision or give such instruction), except for fraud or willful misconduct by the Stockholder Representative; and each Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder and Company Warrant Holder, jointly and severally, shall indemnify each Stockholder Representative for any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses which such Stockholder Representative shall suffer and which relate to or arise, directly or indirectly, out of any action taken by him/her in his/her capacity as a Stockholder Representative in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which are asserted by any other Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or Company Warrant Holder against such Stockholder Representative in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

-10-
(iv)
 
remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this
Section 1.9

(c)
 
In the event that any of Howard Kaepplein, Bernhard Schroter and Robert Chmielinski P.C. (or any of their substitutes as Stockholder Representative) dies, becomes unable to perform his or her responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, then David Steadman (or his substitute) shall fill such vacancy and shall be deemed to be a Stockholder Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the documents delivered pursuant hereto. In the event that all of the foregoing individuals are unable or unwilling to serve as a Stockholder Representative, alternate Stockholder Representatives shall be elected by the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, assuming the conversion, exchange and/or exercise of all outstanding Eligible Company Options and Company Warrants which are then currently convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock.

Bel Agrees to Acquire Galaxy Power
 
 
FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATELY
 
March 4, 2005
 
JERSEY CITY, New Jersey,
March 4, 2005 . . .
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced that is has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Westborough, MA based Galaxy Power, Inc. for approximately $18 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $2 million in liabilities. Galaxy, a private company, is
a leading designer and manufacturer of high-density dc-dc converters for distributed power and telecommunications applications. The acquisition is subject to certain customary conditions, including the approval of Galaxys shareholders.
 
By acquiring Galaxy and merging it with our existing Bel Power Products division, we significantly broaden the range of on-board power solutions we can offer our customers, said Dan Bernstein, CEO of Bel. Whereas Bel has historically been strong in non-isolated converters, Galaxy has a strong track record in the development of high-density isolated converters. We believe that the combined portfolio will be second to none in the power industry.
 
We believe that Bels cost-effective manufacturing facilities in China can provide the competitive edge needed to grow the Galaxy business in the coming years, added Marshall Miles, General Manager for Bel Power Products. The combination of strengths in manufacturing, design and packaging coupled with the broad product portfolio should serve to make Bel a formidable competitor in the dc-dc converter market.
 
Unaudited net sales for Galaxy during the year ended December 31, 2004 were approximately $18.6 million. Galaxys unaudited net income for 2004 was approximately $0.8 million. It is expected that this acquisition will be immediately accretive to Bel shareholders. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of this month.
 
Stephens Inc. (
www.stephens.com
), an investment banking firm based in Little Rock, AR, acted as an advisor to Bel for this transaction.
 
About Bel
Bel (
www.BelFuse.com
) and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of products used in networking, telecommunications, high speed data transmission, automotive and consumer electronics. Products include magnetics (discrete components, power transformers and MagJacks) modules (dc/dc converters, integrated analog front end modules, custom designs), circuit protection (miniature, micro and surface mount fuses) and interconnect devices (passive jacks, plugs and cable assemblies). The Company operates facilities around the world.
Except for historical information contained in this news release, the matters discussed (including the anticipated timing of the acquisition, the potential market impact of the acquisition and the expected impact on Bels results of operations) are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements are: the market concerns facing our customers, the continuing viability of sectors that rely on our products, the effect of business and economic conditions; the difficulties inherent in integrating remote businesses that may have followed business practices that differ from the Company's business practices; capacity and supply constraints or difficulties; product development, commercializing or technological difficulties; the regulatory and trade environment; the market's acceptance of the acquisition and competitive responses to the Companys new products, and other risk factors detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. Such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results reflected in such forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will in fact prove to be correct. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey,
April 27, 2005 . . .
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2005.
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2005, revenue increased 7% to $45,438,000 from $42,357,000 for the first quarter of 2004. Net earnings were $4,313,000, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $4,655,000, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
 
"We were pleased by the increase in revenue, especially because the first quarter was our weakest quarter of the year in both 2003 and 2004. Gross margin was reduced slightly compared to prior year by an unfavorable mix of sales, although the unusually high tax rate due to an accrual for higher taxes in Asia was primarily responsible for the decline in earnings for the quarter," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's President.
 
Bernstein continued, "The acquisition of Galaxy Power Inc. we completed on March 23, 2005 brought to Bel a strong team of engineering professionals and an extensive line of custom power products that have proven themselves in the marketplace. We already have eliminated approximately $600,000 of annualized overhead costs, and we anticipate additional savings as we integrate the Galaxy facility and its portfolio of power products into Bel's global manufacturing and sales channels."
 
Bernstein added, "On April 4, 2005, Bel reiterated its interest in pursuing a business combination with Artesyn Technologies, Inc., and our willingness to begin negotiations. However, in light of the recent Galaxy acquisition and additional investments in our power group, we also notified Artesyn that we would not remain open to such discussions indefinitely and that a failure of Artesyn to respond in a timely manner could diminish Bel's valuation of Artesyn. As of today there has been no response from Artesyn."
 
At March 31, 2005, Bel had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $88,600,000, working capital of approximately $115,300,000, a current ratio of 4-to-1, total long-term debt of $6,000,000 (of which $2,000,000 is current) and shareholders' equity of approximately $179,800,000.

JERSEY CITY, NJ,
May 12, 2005 . . .
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ: BELFA & NASDAQ: BELFB)
today announced that it has sent a further letter to the Board of Directors of
Artesyn Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSN)
reiterating Bel's current views regarding its holdings of Artesyn common stock.
 
As previously disclosed, Bel owns 2,037,500 shares of Artesyn's common stock. Based on Artesyn's outstanding shares as of March 31, 2005, Bel's shares represent 5% of Artesyn's outstanding common stock.
 
Bel's letter expresses disappointment with the recent performance of Artesyn's stock price, which closed at $6.57 on NASDAQ on May 11, 2005.
 
The letter to the Artesyn Board also describes Bel's frustration over Artesyn's continuing refusal to even meet with Bel to consider the possibilities of a business combination between Artesyn and Bel.
 
Finally, the letter indicates Bel's intention to either decrease the consideration proposed to be paid by Bel or withdraw its proposal if Artesyn does not arrange a meeting with Bel by June 3, 2005.
 
Daniel Bernstein, President and CEO of Bel, commented: "I cannot understand Artesyn's refusal to even commence a dialogue with us. I fail to see how Artesyn's management and Artesyn's Board can be discharging their duties to the shareholders of Artesyn when they refuse even to pick up the telephone and speak on a substantive basis with us. We have made many requests to establish a framework in which both parties can listen to each other. To date, such requests have gone unanswered."

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, July 27, 2005 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
announced today that net sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005 increased 19% to a record $57,545,000 compared to $48,390,000 for the second quarter of 2004. Net income for this year's second quarter was $6,669,000, or $0.58 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $7,145,000, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2004. Results for the second quarter of 2004 included a net after-tax gain of $0.12 per share from net proceeds of $2,935,000 from the settlement of a lawsuit and a fixed asset write down of $1,033,000.
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, sales increased 13% to a record $102,984,000 from $90,747,000 for the same period last year. Net income was $10,982,000, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to $11,800,000, or $1.03 per diluted share, for last year's first six months. Results for the first six months of 2004 included a net after-tax gain of $0.12 per share from the settlement and fixed asset write-down mentioned above.
"Second quarter revenue growth was paced by continued robust sales of our new DC/DC products, combined with additional power product sales from the acquisition of Galaxy Power in March 2005. We are extremely pleased with the benefits already achieved from the integration of Galaxy into Bel. Computer systems have now been converted, materials costs have been reduced and we have blended both Company's research and development resources. Bel expects to achieve further synergies from this acquisition upon completing the transfer of a key high volume program to our manufacturing operations in Asia," said Daniel Bernstein, president of Bel.
At June 30, 2005, Bel reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $72,508,000, working capital of approximately $115,748,000, a current ratio of 4.5-to-1, total long term obligation of $2,603,000 and shareholders' equity of approximately $186,853,000.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, October 26, 2005 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced operating results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005.
Third Quarter Results
For the three months ended September 30, 2005, revenue increased 13% to $56,248,000 from $49,986,000 for the same period last year. Pre-tax income increased to $7,364,000 for this year's third quarter from $7,102,000 for the third quarter of 2004. Net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $5,986,000, or $0.52 per diluted share, reflecting a 19% effective tax rate. This compares to net income for the third quarter of 2004 of $6,894,000, or $0.60 per diluted share, reflecting a 3% effective tax rate that resulted principally from one-time events.
At September 30, 2005, Bel reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $82,514,000, working capital of approximately $123,283,000, a current ratio of 4.4-to-1, total long term obligations of $3,026,000 and shareholders' equity of approximately $194,439,000.
Nine Month Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, revenue increased 13% to $159,231,000 from $140,733,000 for the first nine months of 2004. Pre-tax income increased to $21,552,000 for the first nine months of 2005. This compares to pre-tax income of $21,858,000 for the same period of the prior year, which included $2,935,000 related to proceeds from a lawsuit. Net income for this year's first nine months was $16,968,000, or $1.47 per diluted share, reflecting a 21% effective tax rate. This compares to net income for the first nine months of 2004 of $18,694,000, or $1.63 per diluted share, reflecting a 14% effective tax rate. Last year's nine month results included a net after-tax gain of $0.12 per share, reflecting proceeds of $2,935,000 from the settlement of a lawsuit and a fixed asset write down of $1,033,000.
Operations Review
"In addition to an increase in magnetics sales, third quarter revenue growth also was driven by higher sales of our latest DC/DC products and the inclusion of products from Galaxy Power, which Bel acquired in March 2005," said Daniel Bernstein, president of Bel.
"We were pleased by our year-to-year comparisons and believe that we made significant progress in the transfer of a key high-volume program from Galaxy to our manufacturing operations in Asia, which we expect to generate additional efficiencies in the future. However, lead times in our industry remain short and pressure on selling prices and certain raw material costs continues. Bel continues to aggressively pursue our new product development programs in power and other attractive markets, and we remain alert for opportunities to expand our business through acquisitions that would enhance shareholder value."

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey,
February 16, 2006 . . .
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced preliminary and unaudited financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005, highlighted by record revenue for the fourth quarter and year as a whole. The Company also reported that it repatriated $45,000,000 in cash in the fourth quarter and a total of $70,600,000 during 2005.
"Organic growth and acquisitions contributed to our solid performance for 2005," said Daniel Bernstein, President of Bel. "Our initiatives in the power products market are beginning to generate significant new business for Bel, and we believe that the Company is well-positioned for the future. We also took advantage of the opportunity to repatriate a significant amount of cash during the year, which increases our flexibility as we continue to implement our strategy for long-term growth."
Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of 2005, revenue increased 15% to $56,684,000 compared to revenue of $49,289,000 for the fourth quarter of 2004. This increase was driven primarily by double-digit growth in sales of DC/DC converter power products and higher sales of MagJack connector modules, and by revenue of approximately $3,600,000 from the acquisitions of Galaxy and NetWatch earlier in the year. Reflecting a change in the mix of sales as well as higher energy, raw materials and transportation costs, gross margin declined to 26% from 29% a year earlier.
Earnings before income tax provision were $6,163,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005 versus $6,513,000 for the fourth quarter of 2004. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $3,265,000, or $0.28 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $6,028,000, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the prior-year period.
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 included taxes of approximately $2,100,000 in connection with the repatriation of $45,000,000 during the period. Before this tax, earnings were approximately $0.46 per diluted share.
At December 31, 2005, Bel had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $93,000,000, working capital of approximately $130,000,000, a current ratio of 4.5-to-1, no long-term debt, and shareholders' equity of approximately $201,600,000.
2005 Results
For 2005, revenue increased 14% to $215,916,000, which included revenue from the acquisitions of Galaxy and NetWatch of approximately $12,000,000. Revenue for 2004 was $190,021,000.

Earnings before provision for income tax for 2005 were $27,715,000 compared to $28,371,000 for 2004. In addition to higher energy, raw materials and transportation costs and the impact of the mix of sales, pre-tax earnings for 2005 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $248,000. Pre-tax earnings for 2004 included $2,935,000 in proceeds from the settlement of legal proceedings.
Net earnings for 2005 were $20,233,000, or $1.75 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for 2004 of $24,722,000, or $2.15 per diluted share.
Net earnings for 2005 included taxes of approximately $3,100,000 in connection with the repatriation of $70,600,000 during the year. Before this tax, earnings were approximately $2.01 per diluted share.
The Company cautions that its fourth quarter and year-end results are preliminary and unaudited.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey,
May 1, 2006 . . .
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2006.
 
First Quarter Results
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2006 increased 20% to $54,626,000, a first quarter record, from $45,438,000 for the same period of 2005. Organic sales growth was approximately 12%, reflecting strong sales of interconnect products and MagJacks. Galaxy Power, which was acquired on March 23, 2005, and NetWatch, which was acquired on July 1, 2005, accounted for the balance of the revenue gain.
"Our hard work to establish Bel's position in interconnect products is delivering the results we anticipated. We are continuing to invest in the development of these products, which we expect to remain important growth drivers for Bel," said Daniel Bernstein, president.
Gross margin declined slightly, to 27% for the first quarter of 2006 from 28% a year earlier, primarily due to higher energy, raw materials, transportation and direct labor costs.
SG&A expenses increased to 17.2% of sales for this year's first quarter compared to 15.9% for the first quarter of 2005, the result of higher selling expenses to support the growth in revenue as well as non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $381,000. The acquisition of Galaxy and NetWatch increased SG&A expense for the quarter by approximately $1,000,000.
Earnings before income tax provision were $4,695,000 for the first quarter of 2006, which include a pre-tax casualty loss of $964,000 for uninsured raw materials destroyed by the fire in February 2006 at the Company's leased manufacturing facility in the Dominican Republic. For the first quarter of 2005, earnings before income tax provision were $5,686,000. Bernstein said that production at Bel's Dominican Republic facility is expected to return to its pre-fire pace by the end of the second quarter of 2006.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2006 were $3,997,000, or $0.34 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $4,313,000, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2005.
At March 31, 2006, Bel had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $96,451,000, working capital of approximately $134,000,000, a current ratio of 4.2-to-1, no long-term debt, and shareholders' equity of approximately $209,392,000.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, July 27, 2006 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2006, highlighted by a 16% increase in net sales to a new record.
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2006, net sales 16% to a record $66,474,000 compared to net sales of $57,545,000 for the second quarter of 2005. Net income was $8,763,000, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to $6,669,000, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2005. This year's second quarter results included a pre-tax gain of $5,240,000 on the sale of the Company's shares in Artesyn Technologies, Inc., offset by a $1,000,000 accrual (classified as an SG&A charge for accounting purposes) for performance bonuses awarded by the Board in connection with the Artesyn investment. Second quarter results also included a casualty loss of $133,000 for costs associated with the previously reported fire at Bel's leased manufacturing facility in the Dominican Republic. Production at this facility has returned to its pre-fire pace.
For the six months ended June 30, 2006, net sales increased 17% to a record $121,100,000 from $102,984,000 for the same period last year. Net income was $12,761,000, or $1.08 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $10,982,000, or $0.95 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2005. Results for this year's first half included a pre-tax gain of $5,151,000 on the sale of marketable securities (offset by the above-mentioned $1,000,000 accrual) and a casualty loss of $1,097,000.
"Second quarter sales of circuit protection products were the best in six years. Record results also benefited from strong sales of DC-DC modules, integrated front end modules acquired from APC and strong growth of interconnect devices manufactured by Stewart, a division we acquired from Insilco. Stewart and APC both achieved record sales for the quarter and we are extremely pleased with their progress since their acquisition three years ago," said Daniel Bernstein, president of Bel.
"Our record revenue is especially noteworthy in view of the difficult environment in the global electronic components industry. The volatility of raw materials prices, higher energy and transportation costs and the fire at the Dominican Republic facility affected Bel's second quarter profitability," Bernstein said.
"We plan to continue to grow our business both internally and through appropriate acquisitions," Bernstein added. On July 13, 2006, Bel announced that its 100% subsidiary Bel Ventures Inc. had acquired 4,900,000 shares of stock of Toko, Inc. (TSE: 6801), corresponding to 5.0% of Toko's total outstanding shares. Toko is a manufacturer of voltage regulators, choke
coils, inductors, inverters and converters, white LED drivers, LC and other filters interface

modules and wireless LAN modules. "Bel has presented to Toko's management ways to combine the respective strengths of the two companies, and we are hopeful that we will resume discussions with Toko to determine how best to maximize shareholder value for both companies. We are reviewing our various strategic options before we determine how best to move forward," Bernstein said.

, February 15, 2007 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced higher revenue and net income for the fourth quarter and 2006 versus the comparable periods of 2005. All information is preliminary and unaudited.
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2006, net sales rose 7% to $60,573,000 from $56,684,000 for the prior year. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 44% to $4,697,000, compared to net earnings of $3,265,000, for the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, revenue increased 18% to a record $254,933,000 compared to $215,916,000 for 2005. Net earnings for 2006 increased 25% to $25,203,000, which included a pre-tax casualty loss of $1,030,000 and a gain on sale of marketable securities of $5,150,000. For 2005, net earnings were 20,233,000.

(a)
 
Payments.

Fees
) shall be made to the Lender, prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date such payment is due at the Payment Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, without set-off, offset, recoupment or counterclaim. The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such time shall not constitute a Default, provided that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 1:00 p.m. on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Business Day for the purpose of calculating interest on the Loans. If any payment under the Loan Documents shall be due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof (except as otherwise provided with respect to Interest Periods) shall be extended to the next Business Day and (except with respect to payments in respect of the Fees) interest shall be payable at the applicable rate specified herein during such extension, provided, however, that if such next Business Day would be after the Revolving Maturity Date, such payment shall instead be due on the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
-15-
 
(b)
 
Set-Off.
In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lender provided by law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and the acceleration of the obligations owing in connection with the Loan Documents, or at any time upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under
Sections 8.1(a) or (b)
hereof, the Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower and each other Loan Party to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, to set-off and apply against any indebtedness, whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower or such other Loan Party, as the case may be, to the Lender any amount owing from the Lender to the Borrower or such other Loan Party, as the case may be, at, or at any time after, the happening of any of the above-mentioned events. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by the Lender against the Borrower or such other Loan Party, as the case may be, or against any trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrower or such other Loan Party, as the case may be, or against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or such other Loan Party, as the case may be, or such trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been exercised by the Lender prior to the making, filing or issuance, or service upon the Lender of, or of notice of, any such petition, assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant. The Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by the Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
 
 
 
Section 3.1
 
Interest Rate and Payment Dates
 
(a)
 
Advances
. Each (i) ABR Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for the applicable Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.
 
(b)
 
Event of Default; Late Charges
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under
Section 8.1(a) or 8.1(b)
hereof, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable thereto as provided in subsection (a) above. If any interest, Fee or other amount payable under the Loan Documents is not paid when due (whether at the stated maturity thereof, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2%, from the date of such nonpayment until paid in full (whether before or after the entry of a judgment thereon). All such interest shall be payable on demand.
 
-16-
 
(c)
 
Payment of Interest.
Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (b)
 above, interest shall be payable in arrears on the following dates and upon each payment (including prepayment) of the Loans:
 
(i)
 
in the case of an ABR Advance, on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December commencing on the first of such days to occur after such ABR Advance is made or any Eurodollar Advance is converted to an ABR Advance;
 
(ii)
 
in the case of a Eurodollar Advance, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, the last Business Day of each three month interval occurring during such Interest Period; and
 
(iii)
 
in the case of all Advances, the Revolving Maturity Date.
 
(d)
 
Computations.
Interest on (i) ABR Advances to the extent based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year (as the case may be), and (ii) ABR Advances to the extent based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate and on Eurodollar Advances shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case, for the actual number of days elapsed. The Lender shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower of the effective date and the amount of each such change in the Prime Rate, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the amounts and on the dates required. Each determination of a rate of interest by the Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto absent manifest error. The Borrower acknowledges that to the extent interest payable on ABR Advances is based on the Prime Rate, such rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the Lender, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the Prime Rate, the Lender has not committed to charge, and the Borrower has not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lender may now or in the future make loans to other borrowers.
 
Section 3.2
 
Fees
 
(a)
 
Commitment Fee.
The Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender, a fee (the

The Commitment Fee shall be payable (i) quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December during such period, commencing on the first such day following the Effective Date, (ii) on the date of any reduction in the Revolving Commitment (to the extent of such reduction) and (iii) on the Revolving Maturity Date. The Commitment Fee shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year, as the case may be, for the actual number of days elapsed.
 
(b)
 
Upfront Fee
. There shall be no upfront fee (the 
Upfront Fee
) due and owing to the Lender in connection with the Revolving Commitment.
 
Section 3.3
 
Conversions
 
(a)
 
The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert one or more Eurodollar Advances to ABR Advances by giving the Lender at least one Business Days prior irrevocable notice of such election, specifying the amount to be converted, provided, that any such conversion of Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. In addition, the Borrower may elect from time to time to (i) convert ABR Advances to Eurodollar Advances and (ii) continue Eurodollar Advances as new Eurodollar Advances by selecting a new Interest Period therefor, in each case by giving the Lender at least three Business Days prior irrevocable notice of such election, in the case of a conversion to, or continuation of, Eurodollar Advances, specifying the amount to be so converted or continued and the initial Interest Period relating thereto, provided that any such conversion of ABR Advances to Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on a Business Day and any such continuation of Eurodollar Advances as new Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the Eurodollar Advances which are to be continued as such new Eurodollar Advances. Each such notice (each a 
Notice of Conversion
) shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit D
, shall be irrevocable and shall be given by facsimile (confirmed promptly, and in any event within five Business Days, by the delivery to the Lender of a Notice of Conversion manually signed by the Borrower). Advances may be converted or continued pursuant to this
Section 3.3
in whole or in part, provided that the amount to be converted to, or continued as, each Eurodollar Advance, when aggregated with any Eurodollar Advance to be made on such date in accordance with
Section 2.2
hereof and having the same Interest Period as such first Eurodollar Advance, shall equal the Minimum Amount.
 
-17-
 
(b)
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrower shall have no right to elect to convert any existing ABR Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance or to continue any existing Eurodollar Advance as a new Eurodollar Advance. In such event, all ABR Advances shall be automatically continued as ABR Advances and all Eurodollar Advances shall be automatically converted to ABR Advances on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance.
 
(c)
 
Each conversion or continuation shall be effected by the Lender by applying the proceeds of the new ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance, as the case may be, to the Advances (or portion thereof) being converted (it being understood that any such conversion or continuation shall not constitute a borrowing for purposes of
Article 4
hereof).
 
Section 3.4
 
Concerning Interest Periods
 
(a)
 
No Interest Period in respect of a Eurodollar Advance shall end after the Revolving Maturity Date.
 
(b)
 
Any Interest Period which begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period) shall end on the last Business Day of a calendar month.
 
(c)
 
If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, unless the result of such extension would be to carry such Interest Period into another calendar month, in which event such Interest Period shall end on the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
(d)
 
If the Borrower shall have failed to timely elect a Eurodollar Advance under
Section 3.3
hereof in connection with any conversion to, or continuation of, a Eurodollar Advance, such Advance requested to be converted to, or continued as, a Eurodollar Advance shall thereafter be an ABR Advance until such time, if any, as the Borrower shall elect a new Eurodollar Advance pursuant to
Section 3.3
hereof.
 
(e)
 
The Borrower shall not be permitted to have more than eight Eurodollar Advances outstanding at any one time.

Section 3.5
 
Funding Loss
 
 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the Borrower shall fail to borrow, convert or continue a Eurodollar Advance on a Borrowing Date or a Conversion Date after it shall have given notice to do so in which it shall have requested a Eurodollar Advance, or if a Eurodollar Advance shall be terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if, while a Eurodollar Advance is outstanding, any repayment or prepayment of such Eurodollar Advance is made for any reason (including as a result of acceleration or illegality) on a date which is prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower agrees to indemnify the Lender against, and to pay on demand to the Lender the amount (calculated by the Lender using any reasonable method chosen by it which is customarily used by it for such purpose) equal to any loss or out-of-pocket expense suffered by the Lender as a result of such failure to convert, or continue, or such termination, repayment or prepayment, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by the Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of such Eurodollar Advance or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which correspond to such Eurodollar Advance and any reasonable internal processing charge customarily charged by the Lender in connection therewith.
 
Section 3.6
 
Increased Costs; Illegality, etc.
 
(a)
 
Increased Costs.
If any Change in Law shall impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, assessment, increased cost or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of the Lender in respect of its Eurodollar Advances which is not otherwise included in the determination of a Eurodollar Rate and the result thereof is to increase the cost to the Lender of making, renewing, converting or maintaining its Eurodollar Advances or its commitment to make such Eurodollar Advances, or to reduce any amount receivable under the Loan Documents in respect of its Eurodollar Advances, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall pay the Lender such additional amounts as is sufficient to compensate the Lender for such additional cost or reduction in such amount receivable which the Lender deems to be material (as determined by the Lender.)
 
(b)
 
Capital Adequacy.
If the Lender determines that any Change in Law relating to capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Lenders capital or on the capital of the Lenders holding company on the Loans to a level below that which the Lender (or its holding company) would have achieved or would thereafter be able to achieve but for such Change in Law (after taking into account the Lenders (or such holding companys) policies regarding capital adequacy), the Borrower shall pay to the Lender (or such holding company) such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender (or such holding company) for such reduction.
 
(c)
 
Illegality
. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if the Lender shall reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for it to make or maintain any Eurodollar Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, the Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof, and (i) the commitment of the Lender to make such Eurodollar Advances or convert ABR Advances to Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (ii) the Lender shall fund each requested Eurodollar Advance as an ABR Advance and (iii) the portion of the Loans then outstanding as such Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Advances on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto or at such earlier time as may be required by law. The commitment of the Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended until the Lender shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice by the Borrower, the Lenders commitment to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances shall be reinstated.
 
-19-
 
(d)
 
Substituted Interest Rate
. In the event that the Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that (i) by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market either adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to
Section 3.1
hereof or (ii) the applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of maintaining or funding loans bearing interest based on such Eurodollar Rate, with respect to any portion of the Loans that the Borrower has requested be made as Eurodollar Advances or Eurodollar Advances that will result from the requested conversion or continuation of any portion of the Advances into or of Eurodollar Advances (each, an 
Affected Advance
), the Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower (by telephone or otherwise, to be promptly confirmed in writing) of such determination, on or, to the extent practicable, prior to the requested Conversion Date for such Affected Advances. If the Lender shall give such notice, (a) any Affected Advances shall be made as ABR Advances, (b) the Advances (or any portion thereof) that were to have been converted to Affected Advances shall be converted to ABR Advances and (c) any outstanding Affected Advances shall be converted, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Advances. Until any notice under
clauses (i) or (ii)
above, as the case may be, of this subsection (d) has been withdrawn by the Lender, no further Eurodollar Advances shall be required to be made by the Lender, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert all or any portion of the Loans to Eurodollar Advances.
 
(e)
 
Payment; Certificates
. Each payment pursuant to
subsections (a) or (b)
 above shall be made within 10 days after demand therefor, which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Lender demanding such payment setting forth the calculations of the additional amounts payable pursuant thereto. Each such certificate shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error. No failure by the Lender to demand, and no delay in demanding, compensation for any increased cost shall constitute a waiver of its right to demand such compensation at any time. Failure or delay on the part of the Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of the Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate the Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that the Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of the Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 
Section 3.7
 
Taxes
 
(a)
 
Payments Free of Taxes
. All payments by or on account of the Borrower under any Loan Document to or for the account of the Lender shall be made free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for or on account of, any and all present or future Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower or any other Person is required by any law, rule, regulation, order, directive, treaty or guideline to make any deduction or withholding in respect of such Indemnified Tax or Other Tax from any amount required to be paid by the Borrower to or on behalf of the Lender under any Loan Document (each, a 
Required Payment
), then (i) the Borrower shall notify the Lender of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as the Borrower becomes aware thereof, (ii) the Borrower shall pay such Indemnified Tax or Other Tax prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (to the extent that the liability to pay is imposed on the Borrower) for its own account or (to the extent that the liability to pay is imposed on the Lender) on behalf and in the name of the Lender, (iii) the Borrower shall pay to the Lender an additional amount such that the Lender shall receive on the due date therefor an amount equal to the Required Payment had no such deduction or withholding been made or required, and (iv) the Borrower shall, within 30 days after paying such Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, deliver to the Lender satisfactory evidence of such payment to the relevant Governmental Authority.
 
-20-
 
(b)
 
Reimbursement for Taxes and Other Taxes Paid by the Lender.
The Borrower shall reimburse the Lender, within ten days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of all Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Lender on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under the Loan Documents (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 3.7
) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (other than any such penalties, interest or expenses that are incurred by the Lenders unreasonably taking or omitting to take action with respect to such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by the Lender shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error. In the event that the Lender determines that it received a refund or credit for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid, or expenses reimbursed, by the Borrower under this
Section 3.7
, the Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of such fact and shall remit to the Borrower the amount of such refund or credit.
 
Section 3.8
 
Changes of Lending Offices
 
If the Lender (or its holding company, if any) requests compensation under
Section 3.6(a) or (b)
 hereof or if the Borrower is required to pay an additional amount to the Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of the Lender pursuant to
Section 3.7
hereof, the Lender will, upon the request of the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to its overall policy considerations) to designate a different lending office for funding or booking the Loans or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in its good faith judgment, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce future amounts payable under
Section 3.6(a) or (b)
hereof or
Section 3.7
hereof, as the case may be, (ii) would not subject the Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to the Lender. The Borrower agrees to pay the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such designation or assignment and the Lender agrees that no assignment fee shall be payable to it pursuant to
Section 9.5(b)

hereof, the Lender shall have the right to sell, assign, transfer or negotiate one hundred percent of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to any subsidiary or affiliate of the Lender or to any other bank, insurance company, financial institution, pension fund, mutual fund or other similar fund, provided that (i) unless the assignee is a subsidiary or affiliate of the Lender (in which case no claims may be made by such assignee pursuant to
Section 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7
hereof, in each case except to the extent that the Lender would otherwise have the right to do so), the Borrower shall have consented thereto in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default) and (ii) the Lender and such assignee shall execute and deliver an assignment and acceptance agreement and cause one photocopy thereof, as executed, to be delivered to the Borrower. From and after the effective date specified in such assignment and acceptance agreement, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and shall, for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, be deemed the Lender, and the assignor thereunder shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
(c)
 
The Lender may grant participations in all or any part of its rights under the Loan Documents to one or more Persons, provided that (i) the Lenders obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Lender in connection with the Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7
hereof to the same extent as if it were the Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
Section 9.5(b)
hereof, provided, however, that (A) no participant shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under such Sections than the Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent, and (B) no participant that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any political subdivision thereof shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.7, unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
Section 3.7
hereof as thought it were the Lender. To the extent permitted by law, each participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.3(b)
hereof as though it were the Lender.

Section 9.6
 
Interest Rate Limitation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Borrower Obligations hereunder.
Section 9.7
 
Counterparts; Integration
 
Each Loan Document (other than the Note) may be executed by one or more of the parties thereto on any number of separate counterparts and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same document. It shall not be necessary in making proof of any Loan Document to produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by the party to be charged. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of any Loan Document by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of such Loan Document. The Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements between the Borrower and the Lender with respect to fees embody the entire agreement and understanding among the Loan Parties and the Lender with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Loan Parties and the Lender with respect to the subject matter thereof.
 
Section 9.8
 
Severability
 
Every provision of the Loan Documents is intended to be severable, and if any term or provision thereof shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof shall not be affected or impaired thereby, and any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.

that: (i) the credit facilities provided for hereunder and any related arranging or other services in connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) are an arms-length commercial transaction between Borrower, each of the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Lender, on the other hand, and Borrower and each of the other Loan Parties is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof); (ii) in connection with the process leading to such transaction, the Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary, for Borrower, any of the other Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other Person; (iii) the Lender has not assumed and will not assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto, including with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document (irrespective of whether the Lender has advised or is currently advising Borrower, any of the other Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates on other matters) and the Lender has no obligation to the Borrower, any of the other Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; (iv) the Lender and its Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of Borrower, the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and the Lender has no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Lender has not provided and will not provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents) and the Borrower and the other Loan Parties has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate.

(a)
 
Subject to
Section 10.1(b)
hereof, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally Guaranties the full and prompt payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Borrower Obligations. The agreements of each Subsidiary Guarantor under this
Article 10

The Lender may, at its option, proceed against the Subsidiary Guarantors, or any one or more of them, in the first instance, to enforce the Guarantor Obligations without first proceeding against the Borrower or any other Person, and without first resorting to any other rights or remedies, as the Lender may deem advisable. In furtherance hereof, if the Lender is prevented by law from collecting or otherwise hindered from collecting or otherwise enforcing any Borrower Obligation in accordance with its terms, the Lender shall be entitled to receive hereunder from the Subsidiary Guarantors after demand therefor, the sums that would have been otherwise due had such collection or enforcement not been prevented or hindered.

Fraudulent Transfer Laws
), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liability (A) in respect of intercompany indebtedness to the Borrower or any affiliate or subsidiary of the Borrower, to the extent that such intercompany indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, and (B) under any Guaranty of (1) senior unsecured indebtedness, or (2) indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to any Borrower Obligation, in either case that contains a limitation as to maximum liability similar to that set forth in this
Section 10.1(b)
 and pursuant to which the liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum liability) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to applicable law or any agreement providing for an equitable allocation among such Subsidiary Guarantor and other affiliates or subsidiaries of the Borrower of obligations arising under Guaranties by such parties.

Section 10.3
 
Repayment in Bankruptcy, etc
 
If, at any time or times subsequent to the payment of all or any part of the Borrower Obligations or the Guarantor Obligations, the Lender shall be required to repay any amounts previously paid by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor in reduction thereof by virtue of an order of any court having jurisdiction in the premises, including as a result of an adjudication that such amounts constituted preferential payments or fraudulent conveyances, the Subsidiary Guarantors unconditionally agree to pay to the Lender, within 10 days after demand, a sum in cash equal to the amount of such repayment, together with interest on such amount from the date of such repayment by the Lender to the date of payment to the Lender at the applicable after-maturity rate set forth in

Section 10.5
 
Miscellaneous

(b)
 
Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 10.1(b)
, the Guarantor Obligations shall be joint and several.
 
(c)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, on and as of the date of any merger, consolidation or Acquisition permitted by
Section 7.3 or 7.5
hereof, as the case may be, that shall result in any Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a Subsidiary, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall, without the consent of the Lender, cease to be a Subsidiary Guarantor and shall have no further liability hereunder.
 
(d)
 
The Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 10756 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the 
Patriot Act
), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow the Lender to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrower agrees to furnish and cause each of its Subsidiaries to promptly furnish to the Lender such information with documentation required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable know your customer and Anti-Money Laundering rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the Patriot Act), as from time to time may be reasonably requested by the Lender.
 
Section 10.6
 
Dispute Resolution.
 
(a)
 
Arbitration
. Except to the extent expressly provided below, any Dispute shall, upon the request of any party thereto, be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9, United States Code (or if not applicable, the applicable state law), the then-current rules for arbitration of financial services disputes of AAA and the Special Rules set forth below. In the event of any inconsistency, the Special Rules shall control. The filing of a court action is not intended to constitute a waiver of the right of the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties or their Affiliates or the Lender, including the suing party, thereafter to require submittal of the Dispute to arbitration. Any party to this Agreement may bring an action, including a summary or expedited proceeding, to compel arbitration of any Dispute in any court having jurisdiction over such action. For the purposes of this Dispute Resolution Section only, the terms party and parties shall include
 
any parent corporation, subsidiary or affiliate of the Lender involved in the servicing, management or administration of any obligation described in or evidenced by this Credit and Guaranty Agreement, together with the officers, employees, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing.
 
-48-
 
(b)
 
Special Rules
.
 
(i)
 
The arbitration shall be conducted in any U.S. state where real or tangible personal property collateral is located, or if there is no such collateral, in the City and County where Lender is located pursuant to its address for notice purposes in this Agreement.
 
(ii)
 
The arbitration shall be administered by AAA, who will appoint an arbitrator. If AAA is unwilling or unable to administer the arbitration, or if AAA is unwilling or unable to enforce or legally precluded from enforcing any and all provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section, then any party to this Agreement may substitute another arbitration organization that has similar procedures to AAA and that will observe and enforce any and all provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section.
All Disputes shall be determined by one arbitrator; however, if the amount in controversy in a Dispute exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00), upon the request of any party, the Dispute shall be decided by three arbitrators (for purposes of this Agreement, referred to collectively as the arbitrator).
 
(iii)
 
All arbitration hearings will be commenced within ninety (90) days of the demand for arbitration and completed within ninety (90) days from the date of commencement; provided, however, that upon a showing of good cause, the arbitrator shall be permitted to extend the commencement of such hearing for up to an additional sixty (60) days.
 
(iv)
 
The judgment and the award, if any, of the arbitrator shall be issued within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing. The arbitrator shall provide a concise written statement setting forth the reasons for the judgment and for the award, if any.
The arbitration award, if any, may be submitted to any court having jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced, and such confirmation and enforcement shall not be subject to arbitration.
 
(v)
 
The arbitrator will give effect to statutes of limitations and any waivers thereof in determining the disposition of any Dispute and may dismiss one or more claims in the arbitration on the basis that such claim or claims is or are barred. For purposes of the application of the statute of limitations, the service on AAA under applicable AAA rules of a notice of Dispute is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit.
 
(vi)
 
Any dispute concerning this arbitration provision, including any such dispute as to the validity or enforceability of this provision, or whether a Dispute is arbitrable, shall be determined by the arbitrator; provided, however, that the arbitrator shall not be permitted to vary the express provisions of these Special Rules or the Reservations of Rights in subsection (c) below.
 
(vii)
 
The arbitrator shall have the power to award legal fees and costs pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
 
(viii)
 
The arbitration will take place on an individual basis without reference to, resort to, or consideration of any form of class or class action.
 
-49-
 
(c)
 
Reservations of Rights
. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) limit the applicability of any otherwise applicable statutes of limitation and any waivers contained in this Credit and Guaranty Agreement, or (ii) apply to or limit the right of the Lender (A) to exercise self help remedies such as (but not limited to) setoff, or (B) to foreclose judicially or nonjudicially against any real or personal property collateral, or to exercise judicial or nonjudicial power of sale rights, (C) to obtain from a court provisional or ancillary remedies such as (but not limited to) injunctive relief, writ of possession, prejudgment attachment, or the appointment of a receiver, or (D) to pursue rights against a party to this Agreement in a third-party proceeding in any action brought against Lender in a state, federal or international court, tribunal or hearing body (including actions in specialty courts, such as bankruptcy and patent courts), or (E) to enforce any assignment of rents contained in the Loan Documents, or (F) to preserve or enforce the Lenders rights and remedies due to possible application of New Jerseys entire controversy doctrine. Lender may exercise the rights set forth in clauses (A) through (F), inclusive, before, during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to this Credit and Guaranty Agreement. Neither the exercise of self help remedies nor the institution or maintenance of an action for foreclosure or provisional or ancillary remedies shall constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the claimant in any such action, to arbitrate the merits of the Dispute occasioning resort to such remedies. No provision in the Loan Documents regarding submission to jurisdiction and/or venue in any court is intended or shall be construed to be in derogation of the provisions in any Loan Document for arbitration of any Dispute.
 
(d)
 
Conflicting Provisions for Dispute Resolution
. If there is any conflict between the terms, conditions and provisions of this Section and those of any other provision or agreement for arbitration or dispute resolution, the terms, conditions and provisions of this Section shall prevail as to any Dispute arising out of or relating to (i) this Credit and Guaranty Agreement, (ii) any other Loan Document, (iii) any related agreements or instruments, or (iv) the transaction contemplated herein or therein (including any claim based on or arising from an alleged personal injury or business tort). In any other situation, if the resolution of a given Dispute is specifically governed by another provision or agreement for arbitration or dispute resolution, the other provision or agreement shall prevail with respect to said Dispute.
 
(e)
 
Jury Trial Waiver in Arbitration
. By agreeing to this Section, the parties irrevocably and voluntarily waive any right they may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Dispute.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey,
March 26, 2007 . . .
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
commented today on the letter it received from Technitrol, Inc. (NYSE:TNL) offering to acquire Bel for $40.30 per share in cash. Bels Board of Directors believes that Technitrols proposal significantly undervalues Bels stock, especially considering Bels cash and cash equivalents of approximately $92 million at December 31, 2006. While the Board is discussing all of its options with its investment bankers in light of Technitrols letter, it is confident in the plans management has implemented for the Companys growth, including its acquisition strategy, and believes that a stock buyback program is in the best interests of Bels shareholders.
Accordingly, Bel announced today that, pursuant to the authorization provided by Bels Board in 2000 to purchase up to 10% of the Companys outstanding common shares, it may commence purchasing up to 1,100,000 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock from time to time in privately negotiated transactions or in the market. To date, a total of 23,600 shares of Bels Class B Common Stock have been purchased under the 2000 Board authorization. Any purchases will be funded from the Companys working capital and will be made in managements discretion. As a result of the purchases, the percentage of the Class A Common Stock owned by Daniel Bernstein (Bels CEO and a director of the Company), Howard Bernstein (a director of Bel and Daniel Bernsteins uncle) and the estate of Elliot Bernstein (Bels founder, who was Daniel Bernsteins father and Howard Bernsteins brother) are expected to increase.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Officers; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e) On April 17, 2007, the Board of Directors of Bel Fuse Inc. (the Registrant) adopted an amended and restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) which provides a limited number of the registrants key management and highly compensated associates, including each of its executive officers, with supplemental retirement and death benefits. Participants in the SERP are selected by our Compensation Committee based upon recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer. The amendments incorporated in the amended and restated plan conform its terms to applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and modify the provisions regarding benefits payable in connection with a change in control of the Registrant.
 
As amended and restated, the SERP provides benefits which vary depending upon when and how a participant terminates employment with the Registrant. If a participant retires on his or her normal retirement date (65 years old, 20 years of service, and five years of participation in the SERP), his or her normal retirement benefit under the SERP would be annual payments equal to 40% of his or her average base compensation -- using compensation from the highest five consecutive calendar years of SERP participation -- payable in monthly installments for the remainder of his or her life. If a participant retires early (at least 55 years old, 20 years of service, and 5 years of participation in the SERP), his or her early retirement benefit would be an amount (i) calculated as if his or her early retirement date were in fact such participants normal retirement date, (ii) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator being the actual years of service the participant has with us and the denominator being the years of service the participant would have had if he or she had retired at his or her normal retirement date, and (iii) actuarially reduced to reflect the early retirement date. If a participant dies prior to receiving 120 monthly payments under the SERP, his or her beneficiary is entitled to continue receiving benefits for the shorter of (i) the time necessary to complete 120 monthly payments or (ii) 60 months. If a participant dies while employed by us, his or her beneficiary will receive, as a survivor benefit, an annual amount equal to (i) 100% of the participants annual base salary at the date of death for one year, and (ii) 50% of the participants annual base salary at the date of death for each of the following four years, each payable in monthly installments. The SERP also provides for disability benefits, and a forfeiture of benefits if a participant terminates employment for reasons other than those contemplated under the SERP.
 
In the event of a change in control (as defined in the SERP), each participant who is employed by the Registrant at the time of the change in control will be entitled to a normal retirement benefit commencing immediately following termination of employment (or in the case of certain participants who are specified employees for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, six months after termination of employment). The normal retirement benefit payable under these circumstances will be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that would commence upon the date that the participant would have attained his or her normal retirement date if he or she had not terminated employment. Further, each participants average base compensation will be deemed to be equal to his or her annual base compensation in effect prior to the change in control. If the Registrant has established a trust to accumulate assets from which to pay SERP benefits, then the Registrant will fully fund the trust in connection with a change in control in order to ensure that there will be sufficient assets set aside to pay all SERP benefits. A change in control for purposes of the SERP includes a merger or consolidation with another corporation whereby the Registrants shareholders do not own a majority of the surviving or successor entity, an acquisition of 50% or more of the Registrants voting securities by one person or a group of persons acting together, a sale of all or substantially all of the Registrants assets to any person, the Registrants dissolution or liquidation or if the members of the Registrants incumbent Board of Directors (or their successors, if approved by them) cease for any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the members of our Board.

Section 14 - Change in Control
 
14.1
 
Change in Control
.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Participant who is employed by Bel Fuse immediately prior to a Change in Control shall be entitled to a normal retirement benefit determined in accordance with Section 5.1 hereof;
provided
,
however
that for purposes of calculating such benefit, the Participants High Average Recognized Compensation shall be deemed to be the greater of (i) his or her High Average Recognized Compensation, or (ii) the annualized rate of base salary in effect for such Participant immediately prior to the Change in Control. Subject to Section 5.6, such normal retirement benefit shall be payable in equal monthly installments commencing on the first day of the month following the Participant's termination of employment and shall continue for the remainder of the Participant's life. The benefit payable at such time shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the normal retirement benefit that would have been payable commencing on the date that would have been the Participants Normal Retirement Date had he or she continued to be employed by the Employer without interruption. Further, if at the time a Change in Control occurs, Bel Fuse had established a trust in accordance with Section 15.8 hereof, Bel Fuse shall be required to transfer cash and/or other assets to said trust in an amount equal to the discounted present value of all of the future benefits payable hereunder to the Participants or Beneficiaries. The discount rate shall be the 5-Year United States Treasury Note rate as published on the first day of the month immediately preceding the date on which the determination is made, compounded annually. If these rates are no longer published, the discount rate shall be some other similar average selected by the Board in its sole discretion.
 
14.2
 
Change in Control Defined
.
 
A Change in Control means:
 
(a)
 
an acquisition (other than directly from Bel Fuse) of any voting securities of Bel Fuse (the Voting Securities) by any Person (as the term person is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) immediately after which such Person has Beneficial Ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Act) of fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of Bel Fuses then outstanding Voting Securities;
provided
,
however
, in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a Non-Control Acquisition (as hereinafter defined) shall not constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in Control. A Non-Control Acquisition shall mean an acquisition by (i) an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (A) Bel Fuse or (B) any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its voting power or its voting equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by Bel Fuse (for purposes of this definition, a Subsidiary), (ii) Bel Fuse or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) any Person in connection with a Non-Control Transaction (as hereinafter defined).
 
(b)
 
The individuals who are members of the board of directors of Bel Fuse (the Board) as of July 1, 2002 (the Incumbent Board), cease for any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the members of the Board;
provided
,
however
, that if the election, or nomination for election by Bel Fuses common stockholders, of any new director was approved by a vote of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of this Plan be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
provided
,
further
,
however
, that no individual shall be considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened Election Contest (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board (a Proxy Contest) including by reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or
 
(c)
 
The consummation of:
 
(i)
 
a merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Bel Fuse, unless such merger, consolidation or reorganization is a Non-Control Transaction. A Non-Control Transaction shall mean a merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Employer where:
 
(A)
 
the stockholders of Bel Fuse, immediately before such merger, consolidation or reorganization, own, directly or indirectly immediately following such merger, consolidation or reorganization, at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or reorganization (the Surviving Corporation) in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately before such merger, consolidation or reorganization;
 
(B)
 
the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the agreement providing for such merger, consolidation or reorganization constitute at least two-thirds of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation, or a corporation beneficially directly or indirectly owning a majority of the Voting Securities of the Surviving Corporation, and
 
(C)
 
no Person other than (i) Bel Fuse, (ii) any Subsidiary, (iii) any employee benefit plan (or any trust forming a part thereof) maintained by Bel Fuse, the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary, or (iv) any Person who, immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities has Beneficial Ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Surviving Corporations then outstanding voting securities;
 
(ii)
 
a complete liquidation or dissolution of Bel Fuse; or
 
(iii)
 
the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Bel Fuse to any Person (other than a transfer to a Subsidiary).
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the Subject Person) acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by Bel Fuse which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares beneficially owned by the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by Bel Fuse, and after such share acquisition by Bel Fuse, the Subject Person become the beneficial owner of any additional Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities beneficially owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.
 
Section 15 - Miscellaneous

15.5
 
Payment to Incompetents
.
 
BEL FUSE shall make the payments provided herein directly to the Participant or Beneficiary entitled thereto or, if such Participant or Beneficiary has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be mentally or physically incompetent, then payment shall be made to the duly appointed guardian, committee or other authorized representative of such Participant or Beneficiary. BEL FUSE shall have the right to make payment directly to a Participant or Beneficiary until it has received actual notice of the physical or mental incapacity of such Participant or Beneficiary and actual notice of the appointment of a duly authorized representative of his or her estate. Any payment to or for the benefit of a Participant or Beneficiary shall be a complete discharge of all liability of BEL FUSE therefore.
 
15.6
 
Interpretation
.
 
The interpretation and construction of the Plan by the Board, and any action taken hereunder, shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties in interest. No member of the Board shall be liable to any person for any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with the interpretation, construction or administration of the Plan, so long as such action or omission be made in good faith.

.
 
The Board, within its discretion, shall have the authority to appoint a committee of not less than three (3) of its members, which shall have authority over the Plan in lieu of the entire Board.
 
15.8
 
Authority to Establish a Trust
.
 
The Board shall have the right at any time to establish a trust to which BEL FUSE may transfer from time to time certain assets to be used by said trustee(s) to satisfy some or all of BEL FUSE's obligations and liabilities under the Plan. All assets held by such trust shall be subject to the claims of BEL FUSE's creditors in the event of BEL FUSE's Insolvency (as defined herein). BEL FUSE shall be considered "Insolvent" for purposes of said trust if: (a) BEL FUSE is unable to pay its debts as they become due; or (b) BEL FUSE is subject to a pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code.
 
15.9
 
Binding Effect
.
 
Obligations incurred by BEL FUSE pursuant to this Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of BEL FUSE, its successors and assigns, and the Participant, his or her Beneficiaries, personal representatives, heirs, and legatees.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, July 27, 2007 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2007.
Second Quarter Results
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2007, net sales were $61,612,000 compared to record net sales of $66,474,000 for the second quarter of 2006. Sales declined due to the Company's refusal to accept very low margins for certain magnetic and interconnect group products. Bel experienced higher sales in its modules group, including DC-DC converters.
 
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were $6,158,000, compared to net earnings of $8,763,000 for the same quarter last year. Net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.49 compared to $0.71 for the year-earlier quarter, and net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.52 compared to $0.75 a year ago.
 
Results for the second quarter of 2007 included a pre-tax gain of $880,000 on the sale of real estate in the Far East and $2,508,000 from the partial disposition of Bel's holdings in Toko Inc. (TSE: 6801), offset by a $500,000 accrual for performance bonuses awarded by the Board in connection with the Toko investment, a $1,200,000 warranty claim and increased legal expenses of approximately $450,000, primarily associated with defending patent claims.
 
Results for the second quarter of 2006 included a pre-tax gain of $5,240,000 on the sale of the Company's shares in Artesyn Technologies, Inc., offset by a $1,000,000 accrual for performance bonuses awarded by the Board in connection with the Artesyn investment, and a casualty loss of $133,000 for costs associated with a fire at manufacturing facility in the Dominican Republic.
 
"The sale of this real estate is the latest step in our program to liquidate non-core assets. We anticipate additional transactions in coming months. At the same time, we continue to evaluate a number of potential acquisition opportunities that would help us accelerate the growth of our business," said Daniel Bernstein, President.
Increases Cash Dividend
 
Bel's Board of Directors demonstrated its confidence in management and optimism for the Company's future growth by voting to increase the dividend $0.02 per share for Class A and Class B common shares, to $0.06 per share and $0.07 per share, respectively, effective with the dividend to be paid on November 1, 2007, and to continue repurchase of Bel's Class A common stock.

For the six months ended June 30, 2007, net sales increased 2% to $123,419,000 compared to $121,100,000 for the first six months of 2006.
 
Net earnings for the first half of 2007 were $10,167,000. This compares to net earnings for the first half of 2006 of $12,761,000.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, October 26, 2007 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 which exceeded analysts' consensus expectations.
Third Quarter Results
 
Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2007 were $66,379,000. This compares to record net sales of $73,260,000 for the third quarter of 2006. "Bel's Magnetics and Modules products performed well during the period, and were the primary driver for the sequential gain in third quarter revenue," said President Daniel Bernstein.
 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $5,914,000 compared to net earnings of $7,745,000 for the third quarter of 2006.
 
Net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.47 for this year's third quarter compared to $0.62 for the year-earlier. Net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.50 for this year's third quarter compared to $0.66 a year ago.
 
Bel's third quarter income tax provision was affected by the release of an accrual resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and the finalization of certain tax audits in Asia, offset by changes in estimates for prior years' taxes, upon finalization of 2006 tax returns.
 
"Labor costs have increased in the PRC due to new regulations and a tight labor market. We have responded by selling several non-manufacturing properties and by closing our Macau manufacturing plant in September 2007 as part of a strategy to consolidate manufacturing in our larger, more efficient facilities. In December, we plan to close another small plant in the PRC. At the same time we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential to stimulate revenue growth and further enhance profitability," Bernstein said.
Nine Month Results
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net sales decreased 2.3% to $189,798,000 compared to $194,360,000 for the first nine months of 2006.
 
Net earnings for the first nine months of 2007 were $16,081,000. This compares to net earnings for the first nine months of 2006 of $20,506,000.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $1.29 compared to $1.66 for the year-earlier period, and net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $1.37 compared to $1.75 last year.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, February 14, 2008 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and 2007, highlighted by higher revenue and net earnings versus the comparable periods of 2006.
Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2007 increased 14% to $69,339,000 compared to net sales of $60,573,000 for the fourth quarter of 2006, and increased sequentially compared to $66,379,000 for the third quarter of 2007. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales in Bel's Modules product group.
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $10,255,000, which included a $3,388,000 (net of tax) gain on the previously announced sale of Bel's manufacturing facility and related properties in Macau. This compares to net earnings of $4,697,000 for the fourth quarter of 2006, and net earnings of $5,914,000 for the third quarter of 2007.
Net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.83 for this year's fourth quarter and excluding the gain on the sale would have approximated $0.55 per share. Diluted Class A common share earnings were $0.38 in the same period last year. Net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.88 for this year's fourth quarter and excluding the gain on the sale would have approximated $0.59 per share. Diluted Class B common share earnings were $0.40 in the same quarter last year.
"This quarter Bel had the second highest quarterly revenue in its history, and demand for our products remains firm. We are seeing PRC labor costs rising, and as previously announced we are taking a number of steps to control our costs. This program will last for twelve months and includes consolidation of our manufacturing operations into our larger, more efficient facilities. In connection with this program was the gain on sale this quarter of our facility in Macau, offset by operating expenses of approximately $500,000 associated with the closure of another manufacturing plant in the PRC. We also continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities with the potential to increase shareholder value," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's president.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, April 25, 2008 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2008.
First Quarter Results
Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2008 decreased 1.5% to $60,869,000 compared to net sales of $61,807,000 for the first quarter of 2007, as higher sales in Bel's Modules product group were offset by lower sales in its Magnetics product group.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were $2,167,000. This compares to net earnings of $4,009,000 for the first quarter of 2007.
Net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.17 for this year's first quarter. For the first quarter of 2007, diluted Class A common share earnings were $0.32. Net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.19 for this year's first quarter. Diluted Class B common share earnings were $0.34 for last year's first quarter.
"To meet a 40% increase in our Magnetics backlog, approximately 3,500 workers were hired after the Chinese New Year holiday, and we expect an additional 1,500 to be hired to bring our backlog down to normal lead times. Inefficiencies associated with training these new workers reduced both revenue and gross margin in this year's first quarter. As these new workers complete their training and become fully productive, a process that typically takes 10 to 12 weeks, we expect to see improvements in our performance beginning in the current quarter. This year's first quarter results also were affected by higher labor and raw materials costs, and a strong Chinese yuan against the dollar.
"We continue to pursue acquisition opportunities with the potential to increase shareholder value," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's CEO and President.
Balance Sheet Highlights
At March 31, 2008, Bel reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $113,736,000, working capital of approximately $173,111,000, a current ratio of 6.4-to-1, total long-term obligations of $16,671,000, and shareholders' equity of $249,421,000. At December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $107,690,000, working capital was approximately $173,171,000, the current ratio was 6.2-to-1, total long-term obligations were $16,273,000, and shareholders' equity was $244,527,000. During the first quarter, Bel repurchased 12,207 Class A shares at a cost of $392,000.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, July 30, 2008 
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2008.
Second Quarter Results
Paced by higher sales in Bel's Modules and Magnetics product groups, net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2008 reached a second quarter record $72,454,000, a sequential increase of 19% when compared to net sales of $60,869,000 for the first quarter of 2008 and 18% higher than net sales of $61,612,000 reported for the second quarter of 2007.
Net earnings for this year's second quarter of $1,811,000 include a non-cash pre-tax charge of $2,353,000 for the other-than-temporary impairment of Bel's holdings in Toko Inc. (TSE: 6801). Excluding this charge, Bel's second quarter net earnings would have sequentially increased 51% for the quarter, compared to net earnings of $2,167,000 for the first quarter of 2008.
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were $6,158,000, which included a pre-tax gain of $880,000 on the sale of real estate in the Far East and a pre-tax gain of $2,508,000 from the partial disposition of Bel's holdings in Toko Inc., offset by a $500,000 accrual for performance bonuses awarded by the Board in connection with the Toko investment, a $1,200,000 warranty claim and increased legal expenses of approximately $450,000, primarily associated with defending patent claims.
Net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.14 for this year's second quarter. For the second quarter of 2007, net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.49. For the first quarter of 2008, net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.17. Net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.16 for this year's second quarter. Diluted Class B common share earnings were $0.52 for last year's second quarter, and $0.19 per diluted Class B common share for this year's first quarter.
"As in the first quarter 2008, our profitability in the second quarter continued to be affected by higher labor and raw materials costs and the weakness of the dollar against the Chinese yuan. We hired a total of approximately 5,000 workers since the Chinese New Year holiday, including approximately 1,500 workers during the second quarter, in order to meet continued strong demand for our products. The inefficiencies and overtime expenses associated with training these new workers contributed to lower gross margin in this year's first half versus last year.
"As these workers complete their training and become more productive, our efficiencies will increase, overtime expenses will decline and gross margin will improve. We will implement a corporate-wide cost reduction plan in the third quarter to further streamline the organization. Finally, we increased product pricing in July, which should help alleviate the strain on margins from the cost increases we absorbed in the year's first half," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's CEO and President.

"We continue to seek acquisition opportunities with the potential to increase shareholder value," Bernstein concluded.
First Half Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net sales increased 8% to $133,323,000. This compares to net sales of $123,419,000 for the first six months of 2007. Net earnings decreased to $3,978,000 compared to net earnings of $10,167,000 for last year's first half.
For the first six months of 2008, net earnings were $0.31 and $0.34 per diluted Class A and Class B common share, respectively. For the first six months of 2007, net earnings were $0.81 and $0.86 per diluted Class A and Class B common share, respectively.
Balance Sheet Highlights
At June 30, 2008, Bel reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $111,449,000, working capital of approximately $177,992,000, a current ratio of 5.8-to-1, total long-term obligations of $17,039,000, and shareholders' equity of $248,075,000.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, July 31, 2008 -- In the latest step in its continuing program to reduce costs and enhance its competitive position,
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
announced today that it will cease manufacturing operations at its Bel Power Inc. facility in Westborough, Massachusetts by January 2009.
"Bel's Westborough facility was designed to produce high mix, low volume power products. While we will maintain design and customer support functions at this facility going forward, declining orders for small-run quantities led us to the decision to curtail production in Westborough," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's President and CEO.
Bel expects to incur severance and other costs related to the layoff of approximately 50 associates over the next few months. Impairment charges, which are required to be recorded as of September 30, 2008 in association with the closing of this facility, have yet to be finalized.

ITEM: Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
On July 31, 2008, the Company filed a Form 8-K (the Original Form 8-K) reporting the Companys decision to cease manufacturing operations at its Bel Power Inc. facility in Westborough, Massachusetts by January 2009. At the time of the Original Form 8-K filing, the Company was unable in good faith to make a determination of an estimate or range of estimates required by paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Item 2.05 of Form 8-K with respect to the costs that may be incurred in connection with the closure of this facility. This Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A is being filed solely to update the Companys disclosure contained in the Original Form 8-K to include certain of those estimates.
 
ITEM 2.05. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.
 
On July 31, 2008, Bel Fuse Inc. (the Company) issued a press release regarding its decision to cease manufacturing operations at its Bel Power Inc. facility in Westborough, Massachusetts by January 2009. The Company is able to estimate certain of the costs associated with the closure of this facility to be up to $2.4 million. The Company estimates that of these costs, up to $0.7 million relates to one-time termination benefits, of which $0.3 million was incurred in the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and $0.4 million is expected to result in future cash expenditures. The remaining estimated cost of up to $1.7 million relates to anticipated non-cash asset impairment charges. The Company is currently in negotiation with the landlord regarding the lease termination. At this time, the Company is still unable in good faith to make a determination of an estimate or range of estimate with respect to the charges related to the lease termination. As permitted by Item 2.05 of Form 8-K, the Company will file an amendment to this Report under Item 2.05 within four business days after the Companys determination of such estimate or range of estimates. Once determined, the Company expects to record the majority of this cost during fiscal 2009 once manufacturing at this facility has ceased and the lease is terminated.
 
This Amendment No. 1 to Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. You can identify these statements by our use of the word estimates and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the Companys and its service providers ability to estimate fees, in addition to factors described under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or described in our other public filings. Our results may also be affected by factors of which we are not currently aware. We may not update these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future, unless we have obligations under the federal securities laws to update and disclose material developments related to previously disclosed information.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
, October 29, 2008 --
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2008.
Third Quarter Results
Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2008 increased 1% to $66,964,000, compared to net sales of $66,379,000 for the third quarter of 2007, as higher sales in Bel's Modules, Magnetics and Interconnect product groups were offset by slightly lower sales of Circuit Protection products.
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $1,946,000 compared to net earnings of $5,914,000 for the third quarter of 2007. Net earnings for this year's third quarter included a pre-tax labor severance charge of $329,000 for the previously announced closure of the Company's manufacturing plant in Westborough, Massachusetts, and a non-cash pre-tax charge of $1,397,000 primarily for the other-than-temporary impairment of Bel's holdings in Toko Inc. (TSE: 6801). In addition, the income tax provision for this year's third quarter was reduced by the reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and the finalization of a tax audit, partially offset by changes in estimates for prior years' taxes upon finalization of 2007 tax returns.
The Company expects to expense additional pre-tax restructuring charges of up to $2,100,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the Westborough manufacturing plant closure.
Net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.16 for this year's third quarter. For the third quarter of 2007, net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.47. Net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.17 for this year's third quarter. Diluted Class B common share earnings were $0.50 for last year's third quarter.
"Third quarter revenue growth was affected by the global economic slowdown, which continues to cloud the outlook as we look forward. Also, margins in the third quarter were pressured by higher labor and raw materials costs and the weakness of the dollar against the Chinese yuan. We expect margins to benefit beginning in the current quarter from recent reductions in commodity prices and higher product pricing schedules, as well as reduced overtime," said President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Bernstein.
Noting that Bel currently owns 7,339,000, or 8.4%, of the outstanding common shares of Power-One, Inc. (NASDAQ:PWER), Bernstein added, "We continue to seek acquisition opportunities with the potential to increase shareholder value."
Nine Months Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net sales increased 5.5% to $200,287,000. This compares to net sales of $189,798,000 for the first nine months of 2007.

Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2008 decreased to $58,063,000 compared to $69,339,000 for the fourth quarter of 2007.
The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $20,853,000 included asset impairment and restructuring charges totaling $21,926,000.  Charges affecting income from operations consisted of $14,066,000 impairment of goodwill, as well as $739,000 for impairment of fixed assets and restructuring charges of $793,000 for the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company's DC-DC manufacturing facility in Massachusetts.  In addition, the Company recognized a charge of $6,328,000 primarily associated with a write-down of the market value of Bel's investment in the common stock of Power One (NASDAQ:PWER).  Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $10,255,000.
The net loss per diluted Class A common share was $1.78 for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to diluted Class A common share earnings of $0.83 for the fourth quarter of 2007.  The net loss per diluted Class B common share was $1.85 for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to diluted Class B common share earnings of $0.88 for the same quarter last year.
"We are taking steps to reduce costs in line with the decrease in demand for our products.  We are consolidating manufacturing facilities in southeast China and relocating the more labor intensive operations to lower labor cost areas in China.  In addition Bel is evaluating other initiatives to streamline operations in other countries," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's president.
"With very limited visibility into our customers' near-term requirements for our products, we must implement these difficult but necessary steps to improve our performance going forward.  Our strong financial position, with cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities of approximately $92.7 million, gives us the flexibility we need to properly position Bel for the future," Bernstein said.
At December 31, 2008, Bel reported working capital of approximately $164,000,000, a current ratio of 6.5-to-1, total long-term obligations of $14,377,000, and shareholders' equity of $217,773,000.  At December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities were approximately $107,700,000, working capital was approximately $173,171,000, the current ratio was 6.2-to-1, total long-term obligations were $16,273,000, and shareholders' equity was $244,527,000.  Bel repurchased 10,822 Class A common shares during the fourth quarter and repurchased a total of 361,714 Class A common shares in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008.

First Quarter Results
 
Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased to $43,871,000 compared to $60,869,000 for the first quarter of 2008.
 
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $816,000.  This compares to net earnings for the first quarter of 2008 of $2,167,000.
 
Income from operations for the first quarter of 2009 was affected by a gain of $4.6 million ($2.9 million or $0.25 per share after tax) on the sale of a building in Jersey City, New Jersey in 2007, which had been deferred until certain environmental and other regulations were resolved during this year's first quarter, and by additional restructuring charges of $0.4 million ($0.3 million or $0.02 per share after tax) related to last year's termination of manufacturing operations at the Company's DC-DC manufacturing facility in Massachusetts.
 
Net income per diluted Class A common share was $0.06 for the first quarter of 2009, compared to diluted Class A common share earnings of $0.17 for the first quarter of 2008.  Net income per diluted Class B common share was $0.07 for the first quarter of 2009, compared to diluted Class B common share earnings of $0.19 for last year's first quarter.
 
"During the first quarter we continued to closely manage costs to reflect the reduced pace of activity in our markets, and moved forward on programs launched last year to consolidate our manufacturing facilities in southeast China and relocate our relatively labor intensive operations to lower labor cost areas in that country.  The business generated more than $15,000,000 in cash during the period despite the decrease in revenue.  Visibility into our customers' near-term requirements for our products is limited, but we remain focused on providing the highest quality products and service while continuing to refine our operations and protect our strong financial position in anticipation of improved business conditions in the future," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's president.
 
At March 31, 2009, Bel reported working capital of approximately $163,000,000, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities of approximately $106,388,000, a current ratio of 8.4, total long-term obligations of $10,213,000, and shareholders' equity of $216,367,000.  At December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents , short-term investments and marketable securities were approximately $92,700,000, working capital was approximately $164,000,000, the current ratio was 6.5, total long-term obligations were $14,377,000, and shareholders' equity was $217,773,000.  Bel repurchased 6,070 Class A common shares during the first quarter.

JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA & NASDAQ:BELFB)
Second Quarter Results
Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2009 decreased to $44,934,000 compared to $72,454,000 for the second quarter of 2008.  The net loss for the second quarter of 2009 was $1,272,000.  This compares to net earnings for the second quarter of 2008 of $1,811,000.
The $2.9 million loss from operations for the second quarter of 2009 was affected by $1.6 million ($1.0 million or $0.08 per share after tax) in severance and other one-time charges.  Labor inefficiencies and moving expenses for the consolidation of Bel's South China manufacturing operations also affected the Company's second quarter performance.  These costs were partially offset by a GAAP net gain of $1.1 million ($0.7 million or $0.06 per share after tax) on the sale of a portion of the Company's equity interest in Power-One, Inc., which reduced Bel's ownership to 4.9%.  This gain represents the difference between the sales price of the Power-One shares and the written down value at December 31, 2008 (based on original cost, the Company actually incurred a loss on the sale of Power-One shares in the amount of $1.2 million ($0.8 million or $0.06 per share after tax)).
The net loss per Class A common share was $0.11 for the second quarter of 2009, compared to diluted earnings per Class A common share of $0.14 for the second quarter of 2008.  The net loss per Class B common share was $0.11 for the second quarter of 2009, compared to diluted earnings per Class B common share of $0.16 for last year's second quarter.
"Conditions in our industry remain challenging.  Sales volumes were down across all of our product lines compared to the second quarter last year.  We are encouraged that second quarter sales increased sequentially, compared to the recent first quarter of 2009, and although we believe that the previous first quarter reflects the bottoming of industry demand, our visibility and our customers' visibility remains limited.  Cash flows from operations, including accounts receivable and inventory, generated more than $5,000,000 in cash during the second quarter, and more than $20,000,000 for the year's first half.  With our increasingly efficient operating platform, strong financial position, and close customer relationships, we are well-positioned to benefit when demand rebounds," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's President and CEO.

At June 30, 2009, Bel reported working capital of approximately $164,500,000, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities of approximately $114,800,000, a current ratio of 8.3, total long-term obligations of $10,408,000, and stockholders' equity of $218,192,000.  At December 31, 2008, Bel reported working capital of approximately $164,000,000, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities of approximately $92,700,000, a current ratio of 6.5, total long-term obligations of $14,377,000, and stockholders' equity of $217,773,000.  Bel did not repurchase any Class A common shares during the second quarter of 2009.
Six Month Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, net sales were $88,805,000 compared to $133,323,000 for the first six months of 2008.  The net loss for the first half of 2009 was $456,000, compared to net earnings of $3,978,000 for the first half of 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
JERSEY CITY, New Jersey, October 29, 2009  Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA and NASDAQ:BELFB) today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009.
"While revenue was lower for this year's third quarter than last year's, revenue increased slightly compared to the second quarter of 2009 and would likely have increased much more but for the shortage of trained labor in China.  Cash flow was strong, as were our core operating results.  Since July, 2009, order lead times have increased, and order backlog is up significantly.  These are positive signs for the future," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's President and CEO.
"Our goal is to hire up to an additional 4,500 workers to meet the surge in backlog and bring our lead times down to normal.  This will temporarily increase labor expense due to inefficiencies during the new workers' training period.  We are adding workers as rapidly as we can in response to the improvement in business conditions, a considerable challenge because of the rapid ramp-up required, labor shortages in Southern China, and difficulties traditionally associated with hiring workers as we approach the Lunar New Year," Bernstein added.
Third Quarter Results
Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2009 decreased to $45,283,000 compared to $66,964,000 for the third quarter of 2008.  The net loss for the third quarter of 2009 was $10,752,000.  This compares to net earnings for the third quarter of 2008 of $1,946,000.
The net loss for the third quarter of 2009 included pre-tax charges of $12.9 million ($12.9 million or $1.12 per share after tax) for impairment of goodwill and a $2.0 million license fee ($1.2 million or $0.11 per share after tax) paid in connection with the pending settlement of a lawsuit.  These costs were partially offset by a GAAP net gain of $0.5 million ($0.3 million or $0.03 per share after tax) on the sale of a portion of the Company's equity interest in Power-One, Inc., which reduced Bel's ownership to 4.1%.  This gain represents the difference between the sales price of the Power-One shares and the written-down value at December 31, 2008 (based on original cost, the Company actually realized a gain on the sale of Power-One shares in the amount of $21,000, or $13,000 after tax).  Net earnings for the third quarter of 2008 included a pre-tax labor severance charge of $0.3 million for the closure of the Company's manufacturing plant in Westborough, Massachusetts, and a non-cash, pre-tax charge of $1.4 million, primarily for the other-than-temporary impairment of Bel's holdings in Toko Inc. (TSE: 6801). In addition, the income tax provisions for both the 2009 and 2008 third quarters were reduced by the reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions, resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and the finalization of tax audits, partially offset by changes in estimates for prior years' taxes upon finalization of tax returns.

Exhibit 99.1
, February 11, 2010  today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and 2009.
JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA and NASDAQ:BELFB)
"The trends in our business are moving in the right direction.  Revenue has now increased for three consecutive quarters.  Expenses are down, our operating loss has narrowed, and net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was up from the prior quarter and prior year.  We are optimistic about the opportunity for further top and bottom-line growth in 2010 as production efficiencies improve and we begin to benefit from the recent acquisition of Cinch Connectors," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's President and CEO.
"Due to the increase in backlog primarily in our magnetics group, we are seeking to hire an additional 2,800 workers at our China facilities.  As anticipated, progress in hiring additional workers has been modest as we approach the Lunar New Year holiday period, but with the new recruitment and retention programs that Bel has implemented we expect a significant improvement in hiring after the holidays," Bernstein said.
Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2009 decreased to $48,665,000 compared to $58,063,000 for the fourth quarter of 2008, but increased 7.5% sequentially compared to $45,283,000 for the third quarter of 2009.  The operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2009 narrowed to $808,000, compared to an operating loss of $18,264,000 for the fourth quarter of 2008 and an operating loss of $15,930,000 for the third quarter of 2009.   The operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2008 was impacted by a $14,066,000 charge for impairment of goodwill, as well as $739,000 for impairment of fixed assets and restructuring charges of $793,000 for the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company's DC-DC manufacturing facility in Massachusetts.  During the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded an additional $12,875,000 charge for impairment of goodwill, and recorded a $2 million settlement of a lawsuit.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 included a pre-tax net gain of $5,390,000 ($3,342,000 or $0.29 per share after tax) primarily from the sale of the Company's equity interest in Power-One, Inc. (NASDAQ:PWER).  This gain represents the difference between the sales price of the Power-One shares and the written-down value at December 31, 2008 (based on original cost, the Company actually realized a gain on the sale of Power-One shares in the amount of $2,860,000, or $1,773,000 after tax).  This gain more than offset an operating loss of $808,000, which included costs of $550,000 ($344,000 or $0.03 per share after tax) related to the Cinch acquisition and severance costs of $130,000 ($81,000 or $0.01 per share after tax).
The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 included a charge of $6,328,000 primarily associated with a write-down of the market value of Bel's investment in the common stock of Power One.
Net earnings per diluted Class A common share for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $0.23, compared to a net loss per Class A common share of $1.75 for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.25 for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a net loss per diluted Class B common share of $1.82 for the fourth quarter of 2008.

At December 31, 2009, Bel reported working capital of approximately $167,800,000, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities of approximately $124,233,000, a current ratio of 7.0, total long-term obligations of $9,017,000, and stockholders' equity of $208,932,000.  In comparison, at December 31, 2008, Bel reported working capital of approximately $164,000,000, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities of approximately $92,700,000, a current ratio of 6.5, total long-term obligations of $14,377,000, and stockholders' equity of $217,773,000.  Bel repurchased a total of 6,070 of its Class A common shares during 2009 for $92,000.
Twelve Month Results
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, net sales were $182,753,000 compared to $258,350,000 for 2008.  The net loss for 2009 was $8,310,000, compared to a net loss of $14,929,000 for 2008.

Acquisition of Cinch Connectors
On January 29, 2010, Bel completed the acquisition of Cinch Connectors from Safran S.A. (ENXTPA:SAF), a leading French industrial group, for approximately $37.5 million in cash plus approximately $1.5 million for the assumption of certain expenses.  The final purchase price remains subject to certain adjustments related to working capital.
Founded in 1920 and headquartered in Lombard, Illinois with manufacturing facilities in Vinita, Oklahoma, Reynosa, Mexico and Worksop, England, Cinch had revenue for 2009 of approximately $56 million.  The transaction, which was funded with cash on hand, is expected to be accretive to Bel's earnings in 2010.
"The addition of Cinch's well-established lines of connector and cable products and extensive customer base provides Bel with immediate access to large and growing aerospace and military markets and strengthens Bel's position as a one-stop supplier of high-performance computing, telecom and data products," Bernstein said.

, April 29, 2010 -- today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2010.
JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA and NASDAQ:BELFB)
Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2010, Bel's seasonally weakest quarter of the year, increased 28% to $56,149,000 compared to $43,871,000 for the first quarter of 2009.  This year's first quarter net sales included $9,883,000 from Cinch Connectors, which was acquired on January 29, 2010. Excluding these Cinch Connector sales, net sales increased 5.5% for this year's first quarter versus prior year and decreased 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $32,000, which included severance costs of $575,000 ($503,000 after tax), and acquisition-related costs and inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments of $1,078,000 ($668,000 after tax).  Net earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $816,000, which included a gain of $4,665,000 ($2,892,000 after tax) on the sale of a building, and restructuring and severance costs of $641,000 ($459,000 after tax).
Adjusted for the severance costs, acquisition-related costs and inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2010 increased to $1,203,000.  This compares to a non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2009 of $1,617,000, which were adjusted for restructuring and severance costs and gains on sale of property, plant and equipment.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures is provided in the table attached to this press release.
Net earnings per diluted Class A common share for the first quarter of 2010 were $0.00, compared to net earnings per diluted Class A common share of $0.06 for the first quarter of 2009.  Adjusted for severance costs, acquisition-related costs and inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments, non-GAAP net earnings per diluted Class A common share were $0.09 for this year's first quarter, compared to a non-GAAP net loss per Class A common share of $0.14 for the first quarter of 2009, which were adjusted for restructuring and severance costs and gains on sale of property, plant and equipment.
Net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.00 for the first quarter of 2010, compared to net earnings per diluted Class B common share of $0.07 for the first quarter of 2009.  Adjusted for severance costs, acquisition-related costs and inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments, non-GAAP net earnings per diluted Class B common share were $0.11 for the first quarter of 2010, compared to a non-GAAP net loss per Class B common share of $0.14 for the first quarter of 2009, which were adjusted for restructuring and severance costs and gains on sale of property, plant and equipment.
Including a loss from operations of $321,000 at Cinch Connectors, the loss from operations for this year's first quarter was $66,000, compared to income from operations of $2,259,000 for the first quarter of 2009.  Adjusted for severance costs, acquisition-related costs and inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments, non-GAAP income from operations for the first quarter of 2010 increased to $1,587,000, compared to a non-GAAP loss from operations of $1,765,000 for the first quarter of 2009, which were adjusted for restructuring and severance costs and gains on sale of property, plant and equipment.  Since its acquisition on January 29, 2010, Cinch Connectors has contributed $788,000 in non-GAAP income from operations during the first quarter of 2010.

At March 31, 2010, Bel reported working capital of approximately $138,300,000, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities of approximately $79,900,000, a current ratio of 5.2, total long-term obligations of $9,260,000, and stockholders' equity of $208,121,000.  In comparison, at December 31, 2009, Bel reported working capital of approximately $167,900,000, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities of approximately $124,233,000, a current ratio of 7.0, total long-term obligations of $9,017,000, and stockholders' equity of $208,932,000.
Daniel Bernstein, Bel's President and CEO, said, "The integration of Cinch Connectors is proceeding smoothly, and we are pleased by the high quality of the people, products, customers and facilities this transaction brings to Bel.  The addition of Cinch's well-established lines of connectors and cable products and extensive customer base helps to diversify our product offerings and provides Bel with immediate access to large and growing aerospace and military markets.  The Cinch acquisition has strengthened Bel's position as a one-stop supplier of high-performance computing, telecom and data products.
"As evidenced by our strong backlog, business conditions in our markets continue to improve. The many steps we took during the past few quarters to streamline our operations and reduce costs are now working to improve profitability and set the stage for better performance going forward.  During the quarter we hired approximately 1,400 new workers at our China facilities toward our goal of 2,800 new hires.  Our operating results in the first quarter are especially noteworthy in view of the inexperience of these new workers, whose efficiency can be expected to increase as they gain experience on the job in coming months."

ITEM: Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
206 Van Vorst Street, Jersey City,  New Jersey                             07302
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
On May 18, 2010, Bel Fuse Inc. (the Company) held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, for which the Board of Directors solicited proxies. At the Annual Meeting, the shareholders voted on the following proposals, as described in the Companys definitive proxy materials filed with the SEC on April 16, 2010.
As indicated in the Companys proxy statement, holders of record of the Companys Class A Common Stock at the close of business on April 9, 2010 (the record date fixed by the Board of Directors) were entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting.  At the close of business on the record date, there were 2,174,912 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding.  However, as a result of protective provisions in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation described in the proxy statement, the voting rights of two shareholders of the Company, FMR LLC (FMR) and GAMCO Investors, Inc. et. al. (GAMCO), were suspended and all of the shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by such shareholders were not included by the Company in determining the number of shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. According to filings made by each of FMR and GAMCO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such shareholders beneficially owned in the aggregate 832,393 shares of Class A Common Stock on the record date. Accordingly, a total of 1,342,519 shares of Class A Common Stock were entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, each of which was entitled to one vote on all matters to come before the meeting.  However, based on the voting results described below, it appears that FMR and GAMCO voted their shares, although the Company is not able to verify which votes were cast by these two entities.
 
A total of 2,110,639 shares were represented in person or by proxy at the Companys Annual Meeting.  The proposals voted on and approved by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting were as follows:
 
Proposal One: The election of three persons, named in the proxy statement, to serve as directors for three year terms.  The following is a list of the directors elected at the Annual Meeting with the number of votes For and Withheld, as well as the number of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes:
 
 
Proposal Two:  The ratification of the designation of Deloitte & Touche LLP to audit the Companys books and accounts for 2010.  This proposal was approved by the following votes:
 
 
For:  2,082,057; Against:  28,406; Abstentions:  176 and Broker Non-Votes:  0.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

, July 30, 2010  today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the second quarter of 2010, highlighted by a 73% increase in net sales and an increase in net earnings to $4.7 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 million for the second quarter of 2009.
JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA and NASDAQ:BELFB)
Daniel Bernstein, Bel's President and CEO, said, "We experienced solid growth in all of our product groups driven by strong demand from high-end telecom, computing and network applications.  Robust business conditions currently appear likely to continue for the balance of the year.   Substantial gains in gross margins are primarily the result of the improved productivity of our new associates in China.   So far this year we have added approximately 2,483 new workers at our China facilities, which has allowed us to shorten our leadtimes.
"Cinch's well-established lines of connectors and cable products represented 45% of the increase in sales and are a natural addition to Bel's traditional product menu.  And its extensive customer base has opened key aerospace and military markets to Bel for the first time, while creating new opportunities for long-term growth."
Second Quarter Results
For the three months ended June 30, 2010, net sales increased 73% to $77,732,000 compared to $44,934,000 for the second quarter of 2009.

Excluding the Cinch Connector sales, net sales increased 40% for this year's second quarter versus prior year, and increased 36% versus the first quarter of 2010.
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $4,695,000, which was net of severance and plant closure costs of $477,000 ($454,000 after tax).  In comparison, the net loss for the second quarter of 2009 was $1,272,000, which included restructuring, severance and unauthorized stock issuance costs of $1,700,000 ($1,160,000 after tax), and an after-tax net gain on sale of investments of $671,000.
Adjusted to exclude severance and plant closure costs, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $5,171,000.

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
(unaudited)
(000s omitted, except for per share data)
 
 
 
(1)    The  non-GAAP measures presented above are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  These measures should not be considered a substitute for, and the reader should also consider, income from operations, net earnings, earnings per share and other measures of performance as defined by GAAP as indicators of our performance or profitability.  Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled captions of other companies due to differences in the method of calculation.
Based upon discussions with investors and analysts, we believe that the reader's understanding of Bel's performance and profitability is enhanced by reference to these non-GAAP measures.  Removal of gains and losses on investments and sales of real estate and charges for severance, plant closure, restructuring, and unauthorized stock issuance costs, inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition-related costs facilitates comparisons of our results among reporting periods.  We believe that such amounts are not reflective of the underlying business in the period in which the gain or charge is recorded for accounting purposes.
(2)  Net of income tax at effective rate in the applicable tax jurisdiction
(3)  Individual amounts of earnings (loss) per share may not agree to the total due to rounding.

"With solid demand for all of our product groups, we delivered the strongest revenue quarter in Bel's 60-year history and one of our most profitable quarters ever," said Daniel Bernstein, Bel's President and CEO.  "Beyond the higher margins associated with our record sales, another major driver of Bel's profitability was the efficiency improvements we have achieved in China.  We increased our workforce by 4,500 associates in just the past 14 months, despite a training period of 13 weeks and an employee fallout rate of 50%.  We are now close to our target labor force and the increased productivity, combined with a more stable workforce, has cut lead times close to normal levels."
 
Noting that Cinch Connectors contributed revenue of $15.5 million for the third quarter, Bernstein said, "The integration of Cinch is essentially complete.  As we anticipated, Cinch's well-established lines of connectors and cable products fit comfortably into Bel's traditional product menu, and its extensive clientele has enabled Bel to diversify its customer base to include aerospace and military markets for the first time."

Exhibit 99.1
 
, December 22, 2010 -- today announced that the jury has reached its verdict in SynQor v. Artesyn Technologies, Inc., et al. In 2007, SynQor filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that eleven defendants, including Bel Fuse, infringed its patents covering certain power products. SynQor asserted 10 claims in 5 patents at trial, but withdrew its willfulness claims and its request for treble damages prior to trial.
JERSEY CITY, New Jersey
Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ:BELFA and NASDAQ:BELFB)
The jury found that certain products of the defendants directly and/or indirectly infringe the SynQor patents. The Bel products accused of infringing the SynQor patents involve unregulated bus converters.  The jury awarded damages of approximately $8.1 million against Bel.
The patents were issued in the United States in 2006-2009. Bel is currently evaluating the impact of the verdict, but does not believe that the impact will be material to its overall business. Bel is also evaluating its grounds for appeal.

On February 28, 2011, Bel Fuse Inc. (the Company) announced via press release that it had delivered a letter to Pulse Electronics Corporation (Pulse Electronics) proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pulse Electronics common stock for per share consideration of $6.00.  The Companys proposal would give Pulse Electronics shareholders the ability to choose whether to receive the consideration in cash or the Companys Class B common stock.  The Company also announced that it has nominated a slate of four highly qualified independent director nominees for election to Pulse Electronics Board of Directors at Pulse Electronics upcoming annual meeting of shareholders, which is expected to be held in May. If elected, these director nominees will constitute a majority of Pulse Electronics Board of Directors.

February 28, 2011 -- and today announced that it has made a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pulse Electronics Corporation (NYSE: PULS) common stock for per share consideration of $6.00. Bels proposal would allow Pulse Electronics shareholders the ability to choose whether to receive the consideration in cash or Bel Class B common stock.
JERSEY CITY, N.J.,
Bel Fuse, Inc. (NASDAQ: BELFA)
(NASDAQ: BELFB)
The strategic and operational rationale for this transaction is even more compelling today than it was in 2007 when Pulse Electronics proposed a merger with Bel said Daniel Bernstein, Bels President and CEO. We believe the offer of cash or Bel common stock provides immediate liquidity to Pulse Electronics shareholders who prefer to accept an all-cash offer and presents others with a very attractive investment opportunity to be shareholders in a combined company with a robust and flexible capital structure available for future expansion.
The combination will create a more competitive global business through lower operating costs, a wider product portfolio, and a stronger platform of engineering capabilities. Furthermore, Bel believes bringing these two companies together would also greatly benefit customers, associates and other important stakeholders of both companies by being part of a larger and stronger global business with greater prospects than either business could achieve on a standalone basis.
Avi Eden, a member of Bels Board of Directors, said, Despite our best efforts Pulse Electronics Board has expressed an unwillingness to engage in meaningful negotiations and has continued to defer discussions to some future time. We believe good corporate governance and their fiduciary responsibilities require the Pulse Electronics Board to seriously consider our value enhancing proposal, which provides immediate and full value to Pulse Electronics shareholders.
Bel also announced today that it has nominated a slate of four highly qualified independent director nominees for election to Pulse Electronics Board at its upcoming annual meeting of shareholders, which is expected to be held in May. If elected, these Directors will constitute a majority of Pulse Electronics Board.
Bel is being advised by Hedge Fund Solutions, LLC and Olshan Grundman Frome Rosenzweig & Wolosky LLP.

February 28, 2011
 
Mr. John Burrows
Lead Independent Director
Pulse Electronics Corporation
1210 Northbrook Drive, Suite 470
Trevose, PA 19053
 
Dear John:
 
I am writing on behalf of the Board of Directors of Bel Fuse Inc. (Bel) to make a compelling proposal for a business combination of Bel and Pulse Electronics. Under our proposal, Bel would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pulse Electronics common stock for per share consideration of $6.00 based on Bels closing share price on February 25, 2011, payable in the form of $6.00 in cash or 0.272 of a share of Bel Class B common stock. Bel would provide each Pulse Electronics shareholder with the ability to choose whether to receive the consideration in cash or Bel Class B common stock. Of course, if Pulse Electronics Board would prefer to negotiate a combined consideration of cash and stock, we are willing to structure a transaction that makes the most sense and provides the greatest tax advantages for your shareholders. Our financial advisors have informed us that the necessary financing arrangements can be obtained to complete this offer and we do not believe there are any significant regulatory impediments to consummating this transaction quickly.
 
Our proposed offer price represents a premium of 11% to Pulse Electronics closing share price on February 25, 2011 and a premium of approximately 22.7% to Pulse Electronics average closing share price for the 60 trading days ended February 25, 2011. Importantly, this offer represents a premium of 37.6% to Pulse Electronics closing share price on December 28, 2010, the last trading day prior to Pulse Electronics public disclosure of Bels interest in discussing a potential business combination and intention to nominate candidates for election to Pulse Electronics Board at the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders.
 
The strategic and operational rationale for this transaction is even more compelling today than it was in 2007 when we last discussed a business combination. We believe the offer of cash or Bel common stock provides immediate liquidity to Pulse Electronics shareholders who prefer to accept the all-cash offer and presents others with a very attractive investment opportunity to be shareholders in a combined company with a robust and flexible capital structure available for future expansion. These shareholders will participate in the significant benefits associated with creating a more competitive global business through lower operating costs, a wider product portfolio, and a stronger platform of engineering capabilities. Furthermore, bringing our two companies together would also greatly benefit our customers, associates and other important stakeholders by being part of a larger and stronger global business with greater prospects than either business could achieve on a standalone basis.
 
As you know, I have recently discussed the possibility of either a complete business combination or a partial asset purchase agreement with several of Pulse Electronics Board members. During these meetings I indicated our flexibility as to the type of purchase and the form of consideration. In fact, I recently proposed that Bel would be willing to consider acquiring Pulse Electronics Network Product Group for cash or Bel shares or a combination thereof. I also discussed some of the exceptional benefits this could have for your shareholders; including managements ability to concentrate their efforts on improving the high growth oriented wireless business. The proposal included a possible stock ownership component in Bel, which would allow your shareholders to participate in the value creation synergies associated wi th the business we would acquire.
 
Despite our best efforts your Board has expressed an unwillingness to engage in meaningful negotiations and has continued to defer discussions to some future time. We believe good corporate governance and your fiduciary responsibilities require the Board to seriously consider our value enhancing proposal, which provides immediate and full value to your shareholders. Toward this end, we believe it is incumbent upon your Board to explain why you will not negotiate with us at this time. Furthermore, if you continue to maintain this position, we believe you should provide shareholders with detailed performance objectives for the business going forward so that the results can be effectively measured against the attractive alternative of the business combination we propose.
 
While we believe it is in the best interests of our respective shareholders to reach an agreement on a friendly basis, and avoid the unnecessary cost and distraction associated with the alternative, know that we are committed to successfully completing this transaction.
 
Our proposal is subject to the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and our having the opportunity to conduct certain limited and confirmatory due diligence. In addition, because a portion of the aggregate merger consideration would consist of Bel stock, we would provide Pulse Electronics the opportunity to conduct appropriate due diligence with respect to Bel. We are prepared to deliver a draft merger agreement to you and begin discussions immediately.
 
As always, I am willing and ready to meet with you at your convenience to discuss next steps.
 
Sincerely,
 
Avi D. Eden
Director
 
Cc:  Pulse Electronics Board of Directors
 
 
 
 
 
Bel urges Pulse Electronics shareholders to take the necessary steps with their custodial banks and brokerage firms to ensure they have the ability to vote at Pulse Electronics upcoming Annual Meeting.
Shares held in margin accounts may be loaned out by brokers and any shares that are subject to a stock loan cannot be voted by the beneficial owner at the upcoming Annual Meeting if they are loaned out as of the March 4th record date. In order to ensure that Pulse Electronics shareholders have the ability to vote their shares, they should move their shares into a cash account in advance of the March 4th record date.
Investors who are interested in adding to their ownership of Pulse Electronics shares and having the ability to vote these shares at the upcoming Annual Meeting should complete any purchases by March 1, 2010 in order to allow for trade settlement by the record date.

Exhibit 99.1
 
JERSEY CITY, N.J. (March 21, 2011) Bel Fuse Inc. (NASDAQ: BELFA) and (NASDAQ: BELFB) today delivered a letter to Ralph Faison, Director, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pulse Electronics Corporation (NYSE: PULS) commenting on the Pulse Boards rejection of Bels proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pulse common stock for per share consideration of $6.00.
For the past several years, Bel has made several exhaustive but unproductive attempts to engage privately and constructively with the Pulse Board about a business combination that makes the most sense for Pulse shareholders.  Each time, Bel was asked to postpone merger discussions to some future date.  And each time, Bel honored these requests; patiently waiting while Pulse churned through four CEOs (including an interim CEO), share value plummeted by more than $750 million and shareholders suffered.
In the letter sent to Pulse today, Daniel Bernstein, the President and CEO of Bel, stated, We were disappointed yet again by your letter dated March 10, 2011 when the Pulse Board summarily rejected our proposal as opportunistic and not in the best interest of Pulse, prior to making any attempt to engage with us to discuss other alternative transactions or suitable valuations that would maximize your shareholders value.
Mr. Bernstein continued, While we continue to hope that the Pulse Board will work with us to structure a transaction that enables shareholders to receive a full and fair value for their investment, we have found no evidence to suggest this will occur under the stewardship of this current Board of Directors.
Bel intends to seek to elect two highly qualified, independent Directors for election to the Pulse Board at Pulses upcoming annual meeting.  If elected, these new Directors will represent a minority of the Pulse Board and are committed to working constructively with the other members of the Board to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are protected.  Specifically, if elected, these candidates intend to urge the other members of the Pulse Board to conduct a comprehensive examination of all strategic alternatives - including a complete sale of the business to the highest and most qualified bidder.
The letter concluded with Mr. Bernstein imploring the Pulse Board to do what is in the best interest of shareholders, stating, Ralph, let me reemphasize what we have said to you and other members of the Pulse Board in the past.  Bel has a strong balance sheet representing over $85 million in cash and no debt; we are ready and willing to negotiate a transaction that makes the most sense for your shareholders, including a revised offer to reflect any incremental value you can demonstrate.
 
 
 
 
The full text of the letter follows:
March 21, 2011
Mr. Ralph Faison
Director, President and CEO
Pulse Electronics Corporation
1210 Northbrook Drive, Suite 470
Trevose, PA 19053
Dear Ralph:
For the past several years, we have repeatedly attempted to privately engage the Board of Directors of Pulse Electronics Corporation in serious discussions about a business combination involving Bel Fuse Inc. and Pulse.  Each time, we were asked to postpone merger discussions to some future date.  And each time, we honored these requests; patiently waiting while Pulse churned through four CEOs (including an interim CEO), share value plummeted and shareholders suffered.
On November 3, 2008, we contacted then Chairman and CEO James Papada, asking if Pulse would be willing to renew discussions regarding a potential business combination.  Mr. Papada responded that while the board still perceives there to be significant upside to such a combination, the timing is just not right for us at this particular time.  Mr. Papada advised us that Pulse would prefer to defer any discussions about this matter until it had a clearer outlook for 2009.  Based on what was happening in the global economy at the time, we understood this position and agreed to restart discussions in the near future.
On October 6, 2009, we wrote to Mr. Papada suggesting that the announcement of his upcoming retirement and the sale of the AMI Doduco business presented an opportune time to renew discussions about a potential merger of our two companies.  At that time, the Pulse Board requested that we postpone discussions until a CEO replacement was identified and the AMI Doduco sale was final.  Again we respectfully obliged.
Ten months later, on August 4, 2010, long after Mr. Papadas retirement and following the completion of the AMI Doduco sale on September 4, 2010, we contacted John Burrows, Pulses Lead Independent Director, to express our continued interest in a business combination.   We were again told that it was not the right time for a conversation.
On December 14, 2010, we sent a letter to Mr. Burrows expressing our interest in renewing discussions about a potential deal that made the most sense for our respective shareholders.  In this letter, we disclosed our desire to commence a meaningful dialogue privately, but also stated our intention to preserve all of our options, including nominating directors for election to the Pulse Board.  This was finally enough to provoke a courtesy meeting with us, at which time we were once again asked to defer merger discussions for another 18 to 24 months.
After exhaustive but unproductive attempts to engage privately and constructively with the Pulse Board, we felt we had no other option but to make our interest in acquiring Pulse public.
 
 
 
 
On February 28, 2011, Bel made a compelling proposal for a business combination under which Bel would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pulse common stock for per share consideration of $6.00, representing a significant premium to market.  Our proposal built in the flexibility to allow Pulse shareholders to choose whether to receive the consideration in cash or Bel Class B common stock and we invited the Pulse Board to enter into negotiations with us to structure a transaction that makes the most sense and provides the greatest tax advantages for Pulse shareholders.
We were disappointed yet again by your letter dated March 10, 2011 when the Pulse Board summarily rejected our proposal as opportunistic and not in the best interest of Pulse, prior to making any attempt to engage with us to discuss other alternative transactions or suitable valuations that would maximize your shareholders value.
The Pulse Boards latest reason for not entering into a business combination with us, discussed in the March 10 letter, is that our offer does not reflect the actions Pulse has taken recently to improve its performance.  These actions, while important and indeed necessary to meet the minimum standard necessary to remain competitive in our industry are, in our view, all long overdue.  In fact, in our letter to Directors Burrows and Barton dated June 28, 2007, we recommended that many of these actions be taken as the best way to generate the greatest return for our combined shareholders (June 28, 2007 letter attached).  Its ironic that Pulse is now claiming that these initiatives are the primary reasons for not entering into a business combination with us today.
Furthermore, the set of strategic actions Pulse commits to undertake over the next 18 to 24 months, such as lowering operating expenses and rationalizing the Companys manufacturing footprint, are hardly compelling reasons for not entering into discussions with us.   In fact, we are confident that a combined entity would have the ability to achieve these objectives more quickly, with far less execution risk and at a much lower cost.  We strongly believe that consummating a combination of our two highly complementary organizations has the potential to achieve significantly more value for shareholders than Pulse can achieve on a standalone basis.  Indeed, it appears to be worth repeating some of these synergistic values again here.  They include:
With regards to your plans to improve the wireless product groups financial performance and to implement a new ERP system, we question (i) how much capital will be necessary to make these projects viable, (ii) the length of time it will take for these investments to return a value above the cost of capital, and (iii) what the ultimate return on these investments is expected to be.
 
 
 
 
Unfortunately for Pulse shareholders, the Pulse Board has a lackluster track record of managing investments.  Over the past five years, Pulse spent approximately $480 million on acquisitions (a total of approximately $590 million including the LK Products acquisition in September 2005) and an additional $180 million on Research and Development, with very little to show for it.  During this same period, Pulses revenue declined 31% from approximately $627 million in FY2006 to approximately $432 million in FY2010, while income from continuing operations fell from approximately $46 million in FY2006 to a loss of approximately $28 million in FY2010. The Boards poor investment record is also reflected in the significant goodwill and intangible asset write-downs, which are primarily related to these failed acqui sitions, totaling approximately $411 million from FY2006-FY2010.
Consequently, shareholders have lost more than $750 million in market value from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2010, while Pulses stock performed poorly relative to Bels stock and other benchmark indices, as illustrated in the graph below.
 
In our opinion, Pulse shareholders deserve better.
 
 
 
 
Adding insult to injury, while Pulse shareholders suffered a precipitous decline in ownership value, the Pulse Board doled out millions of dollars in excessive compensation and fringe benefits to a select few senior managers.
For example, from 2006 to 2009, the Pulse Board rewarded the CEO and the CFO with approximately $14.5 million in salary, stock awards, tax gross ups, social club memberships and other perks.  What is even more appalling is that, as part of this compensation, in June 2009 these two individuals collected one-time change-in-control payments totaling more than $4.0 million following the sale of Pulses Medtech subsidiary, a business acquired under the same management team less than 18 months earlier.  In addition, eight other present and former employees received lump sum payments as a result of this transaction.  Soon after these windfall payments were made, the CEO retired (on April 2, 2010) while the CFO continued to earn the same generous salary as before, despite having responsibilities today for a muc h smaller business.
It appears that corporate governance experts have been equally concerned about Pulses poor performance, declining shareholder returns and troubling pay practices.  In 2009, ISS, a leading corporate governance and proxy vote advisory firm, recommended shareholders withhold voting their shares for the election of the Companys three director nominees because of multiple problematic governance provisions, including entering into new employment agreements with senior managers which contained excise tax gross-ups.  As a result, shareholders representing 44% of the shares voted in the election of directors at the annual meeting did not support these candidates re-election, forcing the Company to take corrective action for some of these governance deficiencies the following year.
Clearly, the status quo is unacceptable.
While we continue to hope that the Pulse Board will work with us to structure a transaction that enables shareholders to receive a full and fair value for their investment, we have found no evidence to suggest this will occur under the stewardship of this current Board of Directors.  Therefore, we intend to solicit proxies to elect two highly qualified, independent candidates to the Pulse Board at the upcoming annual meeting.  If elected, these new Directors will represent a minority of the Pulse Board and are committed to working constructively with the other members of the Board to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are protected.  Specifically, if elected, our candidates intend to urge the other members of the Pulse Board to conduct a comprehensive examination of all strategic alternatives - inc luding a complete sale of the business to the highest and most qualified bidder.
Ralph, let me reemphasize what we have said to you and other members of the Pulse Board in the past.  Bel has a strong balance sheet representing over $85 million in cash and no debt; we are ready and willing to negotiate a transaction that makes the most sense for your shareholders, including a revised offer to reflect any incremental value you can demonstrate.
We implore the Pulse Board to do what is in the best interest of shareholders.
Sincerely,
Daniel Bernstein
Director, President and CEO

The full text of the letter follows:
 
 
April 11, 2011
Dear Pulse Electronics Shareholder:
Bel Fuse Inc. is seeking your support for the election of our two highly-qualified, independent nominees to the Board of Directors of Pulse Electronics Corporation at Pulses 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled to be held on May 18, 2011.    We are seeking representation on the Pulse Board because we believe that the current directors of Pulse have not acted in the best interests of shareholders.  
We are not seeking control of the Pulse Board and these nominees have no agenda other than examining ALL options available to maximize value for Pulse shareholders.
 
Over the past decade, the electronic components industry has become increasingly more cost-competitive and, as a result, it has become incrementally more difficult for businesses within the industry to sustain profitable results.  Consequently, economies of scale and scope of resources have emerged as two extremely important aspects for remaining competitive and for producing long-term, sustainable shareholder wealth.  Recognizing this dynamic, in 2006, representatives from Bel and Pulse began discussing a framework for a potential business combination that made strong strategic sense and that had the potential to create more value than either company could achieve on a standalone basis. Today, with the electronic components industry facing higher operating costs and a more competitive global environment, we are convinced that the strategic rationale for such a combined business entity is even more compelling.
 
Since 2008, we have attempted to renew merger discussions on four different occasions with members of the Pulse Board.  Unfortunately, despite the clear benefits we believe a business combination would yield for both companies and the value such a transaction would create for all shareholders, we were told by members of the Pulse Board that it was either not the right time for a conversation or that they preferred to defer substantive negotiations to a future date.  Each time, we respectfully honored these requests, patiently waiting while (including an interim CEO), the value of Pulse deteriorated (Pulses over the past five years) and the Pulse Board distributed millions in compensation and fringe benefits to a select few senior managers (Pulses in salary, stock awards, tax gross ups, social club memberships, retirement plan benefits and other perks over the past five years).
Pulse churned through four CEOs
market value has declined by more than $750 million
top two senior managers have been paid $25.7 million
 
 
 
 
 
After years of unsuccessful attempts to engage with the Pulse Board, we felt we had no other option but to make our interest public.  On February 28, 2011, we made a compelling proposal for a business combination under which .  In this letter, we expressed our flexibility to negotiate a deal that makes the most sense for Pulse shareholders and invited the Pulse Board to engage with us once again.  Following the delivery of this letter, we contacted Pulses CEO to indicate our if Pulse could demonstrate to us that it was worth more.  On March 10, 2011, prior to making any attempt to discuss any alternative transaction or suitable valuation, we received a letter from Pulse summarily rejecting our proposal.
Bel would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pulse common stock for per share consideration of $6.00 in cash
or
Bel Class B common stock
willingness to revise our offer to reflect a higher price
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If elected, our two highly-qualified director nominees  who are completely independent of Bel and were introduced to us through a specialized corporate governance consulting firm  will represent a minority of the Pulse Board and are committed to working constructively with the other members of the Pulse Board to ensure that the interests of Pulse shareholders are fully protected.
ALL
 
 
The Pulse Board has dismissed our $6.00 offer in cash or Bel Class B common stock as opportunistic and unfair, stating that our proposal would give Pulse shareholders no voting rights in the combined company and does not specify the amount of cash and stock being offered.  Bels offer is not opportunistic nor is it unfair.  We have attempted to enter into merger negotiations with Pulse since 2008.  Furthermore, as we have previously communicated to Pulse, we are willing to revise our offer to reflect a higher price if Pulse can demonstrate to us that it is worth more.
 
We have also stated that
we are open to discussing alternative structures and forms of consideration.  However, the Pulse Board must first agree to discuss such alternatives.
 
 
 
 
 
What should be particularly concerning to shareholders is that, as part of this $25.7 million in total compensation, in June 2009
PULSE HAS LOST $751 MILLION IN MARKET VALUE WHILE THE CEO & CFO HAVE BEEN PAID $25.7 MILLION IN TOTAL COMPENSATION
.
these two individuals collected one-time change-in-control payments totaling more than $4.0 million following the sale of Pulses Medtech subsidiary,
a business acquired under the same management team less than 18 months earlier
.
 
 
 
While we continue to hope that the Pulse Board will work with us to structure a transaction that enables shareholders to receive a full and fair value for their investment, we do not believe this will occur under the stewardship of this current board of directors.  Therefore, we are asking you to vote FOR the election of our two highly-qualified, independent candidates Timothy E. Brog and James Dennedy to the Pulse Board by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope.
GOLD
Sincerely,
 
/s/

Exhibit 99.2
 
April 11, 2011
Dear Pulse Electronics Shareholder:
Bel Fuse Inc. is seeking your support for the election of our two highly-qualified, independent nominees to the Board of Directors of Pulse Electronics Corporation at Pulses 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled to be held on May 18, 2011.    We are seeking representation on the Pulse Board because we believe that the current directors of Pulse have not acted in the best interests of shareholders.  
We are not seeking control of the Pulse Board and these nominees have no agenda other than examining ALL options available to maximize value for Pulse shareholders.
 
Over the past decade, the electronic components industry has become increasingly more cost-competitive and, as a result, it has become incrementally more difficult for businesses within the industry to sustain profitable results.  Consequently, economies of scale and scope of resources have emerged as two extremely important aspects for remaining competitive and for producing long-term, sustainable shareholder wealth.  Recognizing this dynamic, in 2006, representatives from Bel and Pulse began discussing a framework for a potential business combination that made strong strategic sense and that had the potential to create more value than either company could achieve on a standalone basis. Today, with the electronic components industry facing higher operating costs and a more competitive global environment, we are convinced that the strategic rationale for such a combined business entity is even more compelling.
 
Since 2008, we have attempted to renew merger discussions on four different occasions with members of the Pulse Board.  Unfortunately, despite the clear benefits we believe a business combination would yield for both companies and the value such a transaction would create for all shareholders, we were told by members of the Pulse Board that it was either not the right time for a conversation or that they preferred to defer substantive negotiations to a future date.  Each time, we respectfully honored these requests, patiently waiting while (including an interim CEO), the value of Pulse deteriorated (Pulses over the past five years) and the Pulse Board distributed millions in compensation and fringe benefits to a select few senior managers (Pulses in salary, stock awards, tax gross ups, social club memberships, retirement plan benefits and other perks over the past five years).
Pulse churned through four CEOs
market value has declined by more than $750 million
top two senior managers have been paid $25.7 million
 
After years of unsuccessful attempts to engage with the Pulse Board, we felt we had no other option but to make our interest public.  On February 28, 2011, we made a compelling proposal for a business combination under which .  In this letter, we expressed our flexibility to negotiate a deal that makes the most sense for Pulse shareholders and invited the Pulse Board to engage with us once again.  Following the delivery of this letter, we contacted Pulses CEO to indicate our if Pulse could demonstrate to us that it was worth more.  On March 10, 2011, prior to making any attempt to discuss any alternative transaction or suitable valuation, we received a letter from Pulse summarily rejecting our proposal.
Bel would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pulse common stock for per share consideration of $6.00 in cash
or
Bel Class B common stock
willingness to revise our offer to reflect a higher price
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If elected, our two highly-qualified director nominees  who are completely independent of Bel and were introduced to us through a specialized corporate governance consulting firm  will represent a minority of the Pulse Board and are committed to working constructively with the other members of the Pulse Board to ensure that the interests of Pulse shareholders are fully protected.
ALL
 
 
The Pulse Board has dismissed our $6.00 offer in cash or Bel Class B common stock as opportunistic and unfair, stating that our proposal would give Pulse shareholders no voting rights in the combined company and does not specify the amount of cash and stock being offered.  Bels offer is not opportunistic nor is it unfair.  We have attempted to enter into merger negotiations with Pulse since 2008.  Furthermore, as we have previously communicated to Pulse, we are willing to revise our offer to reflect a higher price if Pulse can demonstrate to us that it is worth more.
 
We have also stated that
we are open to discussing alternative structures and forms of consideration.  However, the Pulse Board must first agree to discuss such alternatives.
 
 
 
 
 
What should be particularly concerning to shareholders is that, as part of this $25.7 million in total compensation, in June 2009
PULSE HAS LOST $751 MILLION IN MARKET VALUE WHILE THE CEO & CFO HAVE BEEN PAID $25.7 MILLION IN TOTAL COMPENSATION
.
these two individuals collected one-time change-in-control payments totaling more than $4.0 million following the sale of Pulses Medtech subsidiary,
a business acquired under the same management team less than 18 months earlier
.
 
 
 
While we continue to hope that the Pulse Board will work with us to structure a transaction that enables shareholders to receive a full and fair value for their investment, we do not believe this will occur under the stewardship of this current board of directors.  Therefore, we are asking you to vote FOR the election of our two highly-qualified, independent candidates Timothy E. Brog and James Dennedy to the Pulse Board by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope.

Bel Fuse Inc. (the Company) has posted two letters from the Company to members of the board of directors of Pulse Electronics Corporation dated June 28, 2007 and December 14, 2010, respectively, to www.ProxyProcess.com/BelFuse.
 
Copies of the letters are attached as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
June 28, 2007
 
Mr. Alan E. Barton
Mr. John E. Burrows, Jr.
Technitrol, Inc.
c/o Ms. Ann Marie Janus, Secretary
1210 Northbrook Drive, Suite 470
Trevose, PA 19053
 
Dear Mr. Barton and Mr. Burrows,
 
Due to the recent announcement by C&D Technologies, Inc. that it has agreed to sell its Power Electronic Division to Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., the Bel Board is currently free to pursue other potential strategic alternatives that will enhance shareholder value. Our hope is that we can now have meaningful discussions with Technitrol regarding a business combination which will yield significant potential value to our respective shareholders, without the unnecessary rhetoric.
 
In late April, Technitrol offered to pay $43.00 per share in cash to acquire Bel Fuse. Our Board continues to believe that a cash sale at that price level is not in the best interest of our shareholders. We believe that our shareholders will realize greater value in the long-term by allowing our management to continue to implement its business plan and strategic initiatives. Certainly a stock merger with Technitrol generates an opportunity under the proper conditions that would encourage us to forgo other alternatives, especially if the combined company has significant cash reserves and minimal debt. Such a strategic combination would allow shareholders from both companies the opportunity to fully benefit from the synergies of the combined business.
 
As we have previously disclosed to you, a successful merger requires that we implement a strategy that would gain the greatest return to the combined shareholders. In light of the proposed retirements of Mr. Papada and Mr. Kowalski, we need to have a Board and executive team committed to deliver on the combined companys long-term strategy. Our plan would include, but is not limited to, the following:
 
     The spinning-off of AMI DODUCO after the consummation of the transaction. We commend Technitrol management for taking steps to maximize the potential value of the AMI DODUCO business segment, however, as a combined company our primary focus should be concentrated on business segments where we are or can be a market leader.
 
     Using the proceeds from the sale of AMI DODUCO to buy back shares in the merged company in order to maximize value for the combined companys shareholders.
 
     Reviewing strategic alternatives to Bels Power Group, Pulse Automotive Group and Pulse Consumer Products Group consistent with our views on the ability of these divisions to become market leaders.
 
 
 
 
 
     Making further acquisitions in the antennae area in order to lessen dependence on a single customer.
 
When representatives of Bel and Technitrol last met in May 2007, we discussed a possible business combination in which Bel would hold a post-merger majority membership on the Board of Directors. Mr. Barton stated at the time that this would be the major roadblock from a corporate governance perspective and would be unacceptable to Technitrol shareholders. However, our subsequent conversations with Technitrols largest shareholders confirmed that they would not object to a post-merger majority for Bel. In light of Mr. Graves announced resignation in early April 2007 and the planned retirement of Mr. Papada in December 2008, the road is paved for a Board of Directors in the merged company that is comprised of seven directors from Bel and five directors from Technitrol, thereby, leveraging our respective Board expertise.
 
Technitrol also expressed concern that our Chief Executive Officer Dan Bernstein lacks the ability to manage a company that would be more than four times larger and far more diversified operationally and geographically than Bels. This was also not a concern that is shared by the Technitrol shareholders with whom we met. In addition to Mr. Bernsteins relying on the existing management of both companies, Bels Board will propose that I serve a three-year term as Chairman of the combined company. As former Executive Vice President and Vice Chairman of Vishay Intertechnology, Bels Board is confident that I can provide guidance and the benefit of 30 years of experience to the management team of the combined company. Vishay is a Fortune 1,000 company listed on the NYSE with sales of $2.5 billion and is one of the worlds largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components with operations in seventeen countries and over 25,000 employees. In order to allow us to implement a three-year strategic plan, we suggest that Mr. Papada and Mr. Kowalski be offered early retirement.
 
Please note that Bel has put considerable effort in addressing the concerns that Technitrol has expressed to us over the past months, and we look forward to meaningful discussions. Due to our travel schedule, we request a meeting of two independent directors of each company for the week of July 16, 2007 to discuss a strategic combination of our respective companies.
 
Sincerely,
 
/Avi Eden/
 
Avi Eden Director

December 14, 2010
 
Mr. John Burrows, Lead Independent Director
Pulse Electronics Corporation
1210 Northbrook Drive, Suite 470
Trevose, PA 19053
 
Dear Mr. Burrows:
 
I am writing on behalf of the Board of Directors of Bel Fuse, Inc. to express our interest in restarting discussions about a potential business combination between Pulse Electronics Corporation and Bel Fuse.
 
We believe the strategic and operational rationale underlying a combination of our businesses is profound, and represents a unique opportunity to create superior value for Pulse and Bel Fuse shareholders very quickly. Indeed, the logic and substantial benefits associated with such a transaction appear even more compelling today following your recent sale of AMI Doduco and your continuing search for a reliable, permanent CEO.
 
We firmly believe there are many advantages to consummating a merger as soon as possible. Specifically, the complementary aspects of bringing our respective companies together would establish a position of formidable strength within the industry. The synergies created from a combined enterprise would form the foundation of a more competitive global business through lower operating costs, a wider product portfolio, and a stronger platform of engineering capabilities. Furthermore, the size and scale of a combined company would create a more robust capital structure which would, in turn, permit better access to capital for future expansion.
 
Clearly, a friendly transaction is the most ideal and preferred path forward for all parties involved, and members of the Bel Fuse Board of Directors and management team are available to meet with you at your earliest convenience to construct mutually agreeable terms. However, since we are convinced that a business combination makes extraordinary sense to shareholders of both companies, we are compelled to preserve all of our options  including, but not limited to, nominating directors for election to the Pulse Board at the next annual meeting of shareholders.
 
preferably prior to yearend, we have no present intention to make public the fact that we have nominated these directors until it is legally necessary to do so.
If we commence a meaningful dialogue,
 
I look forward to hearing from you soon to coordinate next steps.
Sincerely,
 
/s/ Avi D. Eden

Director

Exhibit 99.1
 
April 14, 2011
Dear Bel Shareholder:
Under our proposal, Bel would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pulse common stock for per share consideration of $6.00 based on Bels closing share price on February 25, 2011, payable in the form of $6.00 in cash or 0.272 of a share of Bel Class B common stock. Under the terms of our proposal, Bel would provide each Pulse shareholder with the ability to choose whether to receive the consideration in cash or Bel Class B common stock.
As you may have heard by now, Bel has made a compelling proposal to acquire Pulse Electronics Corporation.  
We believe the strategic and operational rationale underlying a combination of these businesses is profound and represents an excellent opportunity to create superior value for Bel and Pulse shareholders.
Going back to 2006, representatives of Bel and Pulse began discussing a framework for a potential business combination that we believe made strong strategic sense and that had the potential to create more value than either company could achieve on a standalone basis.  Since 2008, we have attempted to renew merger discussions on four different occasions with members of the Pulse Board.  Despite our best efforts, and despite the clear benefits we believe this transaction would yield for both companies, Pulse has refused to seriously engage in negotiations with us.  As a result, we have nominated two highly-qualified, independent directors for election to the Pulse Board at Pulses annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for May 18, 2011.
It is important to note that these are only the first few steps in what may prove to be an extended process.  However, you can be confident that this development will not affect our operating focus and our commitment to deliver sustainable value to you.
For more information about this transaction, you can find additional information at , or you can call me or Colin Dunn (201) 432-0463 at any time.  Thank you for your continued support.

Dear Pulse Electronics Shareholder:
 
 
The Board of Directors of Pulse Electronics has recently made statements regarding Bel's solicitation of proxies to elect two independent nominees to the Pulse Board at its upcoming annual meeting of shareholders that we believe are misleading and are intended to divert attention away from Pulse's poor performance and the clear benefits of combining both companies. In response, Bel has issued a shareholder presentation that seeks to address these statements and clarify why now is the right time for Pulse shareholders to act. You are encouraged to read the complete investor presentation, which is available at .

Dear Pulse Electronics Shareholder:
The Board of Directors of Pulse Electronics has recently made statements regarding Bels solicitation of proxies to elect two independent nominees to the Pulse Board at its upcoming annual meeting of shareholders that we believe are misleading and are intended to divert attention away from Pulses poor performance and the clear benefits of combining both companies.  In response, Bel has issued a shareholder presentation that seeks to address these statements and clarify why now is the right time for Pulse shareholders to act.  You are encouraged to read the complete investor presentation, which is available at www.ProxyProcess.com/BelFuse.
Listed below are a few important points you should consider when voting the GOLD proxy card.
      Bel offered a significant premium for Pulse which is well above what analysts indicate Pulse is worth by itself
      Bel is willing to revise the offer price and the form of consideration to include cash and/or stock
      Bel is willing to collapse its A/B share structure if it makes the most sense for all shareholders
      Bel has the ability to finance and close the transaction quickly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have any questions about Bels nominees, or would like to speak with a representative from Bel to discuss this matter further, please contact Waheed Hassan from Alliance Advisors at whassan@allianceadvisorsllc.com or 877-777-5017 to coordinate a meeting.
Sincerely,

On May 17, 2011, Bel Fuse Inc. (the Company) held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, for which the Board of Directors solicited proxies. At the Annual Meeting, the shareholders voted on the following proposals, as described in the Companys definitive proxy materials filed with the SEC on April 15, 2011.
As indicated in the Companys proxy statement, holders of record of the Companys Class A Common Stock at the close of business on April 8, 2011 (the record date fixed by the Board of Directors) were entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting.  At the close of business on the record date, there were 2,174,912 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding.  However, as a result of protective provisions in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation described in the proxy statement, the voting rights of two shareholders of the Company, FMR LLC (FMR), which beneficially owned 346,718 shares of Class A Common Stock on the record date, and GAMCO Investors, Inc. et. al. (GAMCO), which beneficially owned 633,900 shares of Class A Common Stock on the record date, were suspended and were not entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  Accordingly, a total of 1,194,294 shares of Class A Common Stock were entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, each of which was entitled to one vote on all matters.  However, GAMCO has informed the Company that it voted 553,800 shares of Class A Common Stock at the Annual Meeting, and also indicated to the Company how it voted such shares on each Proposal.  The voting results for each of the Proposals reported below do not include the shares voted by GAMCO.  FMR has informed the Company that it rescinded any votes it may have previously submitted prior to the Annual Meeting.  Accordingly, no adjustment in the voting results was required for the FMR shares.
 
  The voting results from the Annual Meeting are as follows:
 
 
 
 
Proposal 1: The election of two persons, named in the proxy statement, to serve as directors for two year terms.  The following is a list of the directors elected at the Annual Meeting with the number of votes For and Withheld, as well as the number of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes:
 
 
 
Proposal 2:  The ratification of the designation of Deloitte & Touche LLP to audit the Companys books and accounts for 2011.  This proposal was approved by the following votes:
 
For: 1,213,399; Against:  1,779; Abstentions:  32,759 and Broker Non-Votes: 0.
 
 
 
 
 Proposal 3:  Approval, on an advisory basis, of the executive compensation of the Companys named executive officers as described in the proxy statement.  This proposal was approved by the following votes:
 
For:  1,023,167; Against:  22,175; Abstentions:  3,225 and Broker Non-Votes: 199,370.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proposal 4:  The vote, on an advisory basis, on how often the Company will conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation.  The vote on this proposal was as follows:
 
Every Year:  553,805; Every Two Years:  22,750; Every Three Years:  470,987; Abstentions:  1,025 and Broker Non-Votes:  199,370.
 
 
 
The Company intends to hold the advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis.
 
 
 
Proposal 5:  Approval of the Bel Fuse Inc. 2011 Equity Compensation Plan.  This proposal was approved by the following votes:
 
For: 665,073; Against:  379,594; Abstentions:  3,900 and Broker Non-Votes: 199,370.

ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
On November 28, 2012, Bel Fuse Inc. ("Bel" or the "Company") entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Tyco Electronics Corporation ("Seller") pursuant to which the Company has agreed to acquire the Transpower magnetics business of TE Connectivity ("TE") from Seller for approximately $22.4 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities.  Included in the Company's purchase of the Transpower magnetics business are the integrated connector module ("ICM") family of products, including RJ45, 10/100 Gigabit, 10G, PoE/PoE+, MRJ21 and RJ.5, a line of modules for smart-grid applications and discrete magnetics.  Bel will also receive a license to produce ICM products using TE's planar embedded magnetics technology.  The Agreement has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors.  The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions.
 
The purchase price of $22.4 million is subject to certain adjustments, including working capital adjustments and those related to the closing cash balance. 
 
The Company and Seller have made customary representations and warranties, which will generally survive for a period of 12 months following the closing of the transaction.  The parties have rights to indemnification for, among other things, breaches of representations and warranties, subject to certain limitations on indemnification, and for non-performance of their respective covenants.
 
The Agreement contains customary termination rights for both the Company and Seller, including in most cases, by either party if the transaction has not closed by May 28, 2013.
 
In addition, the Seller has agreed, subject to certain qualifications, that for a period of three years after the closing, it will not, directly or indirectly, engage in a business that manufactures, sells or distributes certain of the products manufactured by the Transpower magnetics business.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Agreement itself, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.  The Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms.  It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or Seller.  The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of specified dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors.  In addition, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement are qualified by information in a confidental disclosure schedule that the parties have exchanged, which has been omitted pursuant to Item 601(b)(2) of Regulation S-K.
