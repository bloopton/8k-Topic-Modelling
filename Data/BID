Pursuant to this decision, the Commission has imposed a fine of approximately $20.1 million on the Company, payable within three months after the Company receives official notification of the decision, which is expected within a few days.

ITEM 5. Other Events On December 17, 2002, Sotheby's (the "Company") entered into an agreement to sell its headquarters building located at 1334 York Avenue, New York, NY (the "Building") to RFR Holding, LLC ("RFR") for $175 million in cash. A copy of the press release announcing this sale agreement is attached as Exhibit 99(a). The Company will lease the Building back from RFR for an initial 20-year term, with options to extend the lease for two additional 10-year terms. The rental obligation during the initial term will be approximately $18.0 million per year, escalating 7% every three years during the term of the lease. The lease will be classified as a capital lease in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Net cash proceeds received from the sale of the Building will primarily be used to repay $100 million in short-term borrowings under the Term Facility of the Company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement due February 11, 2003 and to fund the $20.1 million fine imposed on the Company by the European Commission due February 8, 2003. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. This sale-leaseback transaction will be dilutive to the Company's earnings in 2003 due to increased charges for interest and depreciation resulting from the capital lease obligation and capital lease asset that will be reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

EXHIBIT 99(a) Sotheby's PRESS RELEASE - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DIANA PHILLIPS MATTHEW WEIGMAN (212) 606-7176 FAX: (212) 606 7381 SOTHEBY'S ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT TO SELL AND LEASE BACK YORK AVENUE HEADQUARTERS FOR $175 MILLION SALE STRENGTHENS BALANCE SHEET $100 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT TO BE REPAID DECEMBER 17, 2002 -- Sotheby's announced today that it has entered into an agreement to sell its York Avenue headquarters for $175 million to RFR Holding, LLC. The Company will lease back the building, widely regarded as the best auction house facility in the world, from RFR Holding for a period of up to 40 years, which includes renewals. "This is an outstanding opportunity for Sotheby's," said Bill Ruprecht, Sotheby's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The attractive price of $175 million reflects the high asset quality, desirable location and Sotheby's bright future prospects. Sotheby's, similar to other major corporations, has decided to enter into a sale-leaseback transaction as a means of financing to provide long-term liquidity for our business. It will also allow Sotheby's to pay down $100 million in short-term debt as well as antitrust fines, which strengthens our balance sheet." Mr. Ruprecht added: "Sotheby's expects to report a gain on the sale of the building in the range of $25 million, which will be amortized over the initial term of the lease as required by the relevant accounting rules. "Sotheby's looks forward to a long and exciting future in our worldwide headquarters that are without equal in the auction world," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "After an architectural makeover, which added six floors and completely redesigned the existing four floors, we have a state-of-the-art auction facility that has received international acclaim,
particularly for its tenth-floor exhibition space. The renovation and expansion were designed with Sotheby's unique auction business in mind and ever since it opened, it has offered us a competitive advantage. All our New York auction operations are centralized in one convenient location and, importantly, the building provides permanent exhibition and storage space for each department, allowing our specialists to `live` with their objects. "We are delighted at the prospect of a future affiliation with RFR Holding whose ownership of premier locations, including the Seagram Building and Lever House, show a clear appreciation for buildings of great quality." "RFR Holding is delighted to add the Sotheby's Building to our expansive portfolio of prime Manhattan commercial real estate," said Aby Rosen, Principal of RFR Holding LLC. "We are privileged to have Sotheby's as our tenant and look forward to a mutually rewarding long-term relationship." J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. acted as exclusive financial advisor to Sotheby's.

ITEM 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets On February 7, 2003, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") sold its headquarters building located at 1334 York Avenue, New York, NY (the "Building") to RFR Holding, LLC ("RFR") for $175 million in cash. Net sale proceeds after deducting taxes and fees related to the transaction were approximately $167 million. The Company leased the Building back from RFR for an initial 20-year term, with options to extend the lease for two additional 10-year terms. Rental payments during the initial term are approximately $18 million per year, escalating 7% every three years during the term of the lease. The lease will be classified as a capital lease. The resulting capital lease asset and capital lease obligation will be recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheet at approximately $173 million. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $24 million, which will be deferred and amortized over the initial 20-year term of the lease. Net cash proceeds received from the sale of the Building enabled the Company to repay $100 million in short-term borrowings under the senior secured term facility (the "Term Facility") of the Company's credit agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") and to fund the $20.1 million fine imposed on the Company by the European Commission. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The expected material impacts of the sale-leaseback transaction on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2003 will be as follows: (i) a net increase in interest expense of approximately $9 million, which consists of approximately $16 million in interest expense attributable to the capital lease obligation partially offset by savings of approximately $7 million as a result of lower short-term borrowings; and (ii) a net increase in depreciation expense of approximately $5 million, which consists of approximately $8 million in depreciation expense attributable to the capital lease asset partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $3 million resulting from the sale of the Building, as well as the amortization of the gain on sale over the initial lease term.
In the future, annual interest expense associated with the capital lease obligation will decrease each year during the initial lease term due to rental payments made by the Company to reduce the capital lease obligation. ITEM 5. Other Events On February 7, 2003, the Company extended the maturity date of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from February 11, 2003 to February 6, 2004 for a total borrowing capacity of $75 million, which includes a $20 million term loan. The reduced borrowing capacity is primarily the result of the Company's decreased borrowing needs subsequent to the closing of the sale-leaseback transaction described in Item 2 above. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 8-K contains certain "forward-looking statements" (as such term is defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) relating to future events and the financial performance of the Company. Such statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties, resulting in the possibility that the actual events or performances will differ materially from such predictions. Major factors, which the Company believes could cause the actual results to differ materially from the predicted results in the "forward-looking statements" include the overall strength of the international economy and financial markets, competition with other auctioneers and art dealers, the volume of consigned property and the marketability at auction of such property, final resolution of antitrust related matters and the successful implementation of the Company's restructuring plans.

EXHIBIT 99(a) [LOGO OF SOTHEBY'S] NEWS RELEASE - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PRESS DEPARTMENT: DIANA PHILLIPS MATTHEW WEIGMAN (212) 606-7176 INVESTOR RELATIONS: SARAH BRIERLEY (212) 894-1023 SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS o FIRST QUARTER AUCTION AND RELATED REVENUES INCREASE 7% TO $38.1 MILLION o SOTHEBY'S LEADS IMPRESSIONIST & MODERN ART SALES WITH $81.1 MILLION May 14, 2003, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID; LSE), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction business, art-related financing and real estate brokerage activities, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003. Net loss for the first quarter of 2003 was ($27.6) million, or ($0.45) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($23.1) million, or ($0.38) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2002. Excluding net restructuring charges of $5.8 million, employee retention costs of $3.5 million and antitrust related special charges of $0.8 million, net loss for the first quarter of 2003 would have been ($21.2)* million, or ($0.34)* per share, which is flat when compared to the same period in 2002 when calculated on the same basis. Due to the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales (hammer price plus buyer's premium) in the first quarter have historically represented approximately 9% - 13% of annual Auction Sales and the first quarter has historically been a loss period for - ------------------- * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B
the Company. Consequently, first quarter results may not be indicative of expected full year results. "During the first quarter of 2003, auction and related revenues increased 7% to $38.1 million when compared to the same period in 2002" said William F. Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. "These increases principally reflect the favorable impact of foreign currency translations, as well as improved February Impressionist and Contemporary art sales in London and the buyer's premium increase that was implemented in January, partially offset by a decline in single-owner sales. Other notable sales in the first quarter include our January Old Master Paintings sale in New York, which totaled $48 million and which was highlighted by the sale of Andrea Mantegna's DESCENT INTO LIMBO for $28.6 million, a record for the artist." For the three months ended March 31, 2003 revenues from the Company's Real Estate segment were $6.8 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 9%, as compared to the first quarter of 2002. This decrease is partially a result of the current market conditions in certain real estate markets in which the Company operates. "Our overall results were adversely effected by the foreign exchange impact of the weakening U.S. dollar," said Mr. Ruprecht. "This resulted in a $1.7 million increase in the Company's operating loss in the first quarter of 2003. It is also important to highlight that the net restructuring charges of $5.8 million, employee retention costs of $3.5 million and antitrust related special charges of $0.8 million, which aggregated $10.1 million in total in 2003, were significantly higher than the equivalent amounts in 2002, which aggregated $3.2 million. Therefore, the net impact of these charges in the first quarter of 2003 resulted in an incremental expense of $6.9 million." 2
SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER SALES "Our spring Impressionist & Modern art sales in New York performed well, despite the pressures of an uncertain economy and the war in Iraq, which made property gathering particularly challenging," said Mr. Ruprecht. "Sotheby's led the competition, achieving a sales total of $81.1 million. Pierre-Auguste Renoir's DANS LES ROSES (PORTRAIT DE MADAME LEON CLAPISSON) sold for $23.5 million and was the highest individual price achieved among all Impressionist and Modern works sold last week. Three works offered by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston sold for a total of $16.3 million and were led by Edgar Degas' DANSEUSE, which brought $10.6 million. Among other highlights was Camille Pissaro's LA ROUTE DE ROCQUENCOURT selling for $5.6 million, surpassing the high estimate of $5 million. "Last night, we held our Part I sale of Contemporary Art in New York, which totaled $27.3 million," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "85% of the lots sold and the highlight of the evening was Jackson Pollock's drip painting NUMBER 17, 1949, which brought $5.3 million and confirmed the resilience of the Contemporary market for fresh works of high quality that are fairly estimated." "We were extremely pleased with the results of our annual spring Hong Kong sales, particularly considering the current health crisis in Asia, which prohibited many of our international clients from traveling. The two days of sales totaled $18.6 million, which achieved the low estimate and our Fine Chinese Paintings sale totaled $4.9 million, above the high estimate of $4.7 million. The World of Qianlong, a thematic offering of ceramics and works of art from the Qianlong Dynasty, brought $8.0 million and was highlighted by A COPPER-RED AND UNDERGLAZE-BLUE 'DRAGON' VASE, TIANQUIPING, SEAL MARK AND PERIOD QIANLONG, which brought $1.3 million -- doubling its pre-sale low estimate. 3
"Looking to the sales ahead, we have several exciting auctions that will take place this month. On Thursday, Sotheby's Paris will offer The Karl Lagerfeld Collection of 20th Century Decorative Arts, estimated to sell in the range of $3 million. Next week in New York, single owner sales of American paintings, drawings and sculpture as well as furniture and decorative arts from the Collection of Meyer and Vivian Potamkin will be offered and are estimated in excess of $10 million. And on May 22nd, our London sale of Music includes the working manuscript of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, arguably the most important musical work ever to appear at auction. Prepared for Beethoven by two copyists, the manuscript is marked throughout by thousands of revisions by Beethoven and is estimated in excess of $3 million. "London will also be offering a number of extraordinary paintings later in the season," said Mr. Ruprecht. "A major landscape by the Austrian Expressionist painter Egon Schiele will be offered in Sotheby's London sale of Impressionist & Modern Art on June 23rd. KRUMAUER LANDSCHAFT (STADT UND FLUSS), estimated at $8 to $11 million, was recently restituted to the heirs of the original Viennese collectors from whom it was looted by the Nazis in 1938. On July 10th, in our London Old Master Paintings sale, a recently discovered Rembrandt self-portrait, estimated at $6.5 to $9.6 million, will be offered for sale. The self-portrait, which has been hidden for over 300 years behind layers of over-paint, has recently emerged after years of painstaking cleaning. It is only one of three Rembrandt self-portraits still left in private hands and the first to come to auction in 30 years." OUTLOOK "Property gathering for our spring season was affected by the current economic environment, uncertainties related to the war in Iraq and the health crisis in Asia resulting from SARS," said Mr. Ruprecht. "Those factors had an unfavorable impact on auction consignments for the Company's spring sales, and will therefore negatively impact the second quarter of 2003. In addition, management believes that the luxury real estate 4
market will continue to remain soft, and may therefore negatively impact Real Estate revenues during the second quarter of 2003. Nevertheless, with the strategic sale-leaseback of our York Avenue headquarters, the successful implementation of our recent restructuring plans, and the resolution of our remaining antitrust litigation, we are confident that Sotheby's is today better positioned to weather this downturn."

EXHIBIT 99.1
August 7, 2003, New YorkSotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID; LSE), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide live auction business, art-related financial services and real-estate brokerage activities, today announced results for the second quarter and first half ended June 30, 2003.
For the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, the aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction by the Company ("Auction Sales"), which includes buyer's premium, decreased $103.9 million, or 15%, compared to the same period in 2002. However, auction revenues over the same period decreased only a fraction of that amount by $4.9 million, or 4%, primarily as a result of the buyer's premium rate increase that became effective in January 2003, as well as improved consignor commission rates. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, net income was $14.2 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to net income of $17.9 million, or $0.29 per share, for the same period in 2002. Results for the second quarter of 2003 include employee retention costs of $2.9 million, a net benefit in restructuring charges of $0.5 million and antitrust related special charges of $0.6 million. Excluding these pre-tax items, the Company's adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2003 would have been $16.1 million, or $0.26* per share. Results for the second quarter of 2002 included pre-tax charges of $6.2 million primarily relating to employee retention costs. Excluding these pre-tax charges, the Company's adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2002 would have been $21.8* million, or $0.35* per share. As a result of the successful completion of the sale-leaseback of Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters in February of this year, the Company's liquidity position has greatly improved. However, as expected, this transaction adversely affected our results for the second quarter of 2003 as compared to the same quarter of 2002, through higher depreciation expense of $0.9 million, or 14%, as well as an increase in interest expense of $2.0 million, or 33%.
*
The Company reported total revenues of $119.0 million for the second quarter of 2003, compared to total revenues of $127.0 million for the same period of 2002. This represents an $8.0 million decrease primarily due to the decrease in Auction Sales discussed above, as well as lower Real Estate revenues.

For the first half of 2003, net loss was ($13.4) million or ($0.22) per share, compared to a net loss of ($5.3) million, or ($0.09) per share, for the first half of 2002. Included in the 2003 first half results are pre-tax retention charges of $6.3 million, net restructuring charges of $5.3 million and antitrust related special charges of $1.4 million. Excluding these items, adjusted net loss for the first half of 2003, would have been ($4.8)* million or ($0.08)* per share. Results for the first half of 2002 included net pre-tax charges of $9.4 million, primarily relating to the Company's employee retention programs. Excluding these items, the Company would have reported adjusted net income of $0.8* million, or $0.01* per share, for the first half of 2002. The Company reported total revenues of $166.7 million for the first half of 2003, compared to total revenues of $172.5 million for the same period of 2002.
Direct costs for the first half of 2003 are down by $4.4 million, or 15%, from the first half of 2002. This is primarily due to lower catalogue production and mailing costs primarily resulting from the lower level of Auction Sales, as well as other catalogue savings initiatives. Also, as anticipated, retention costs were down by $6.2 million in the first half of 2003 compared to the same period of 2002. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements, total operating expenses for the first half of 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002 have decreased by approximately $9.6* million (excluding retention costs, net restructuring charges and antitrust related and special charges), which is in addition to the over $70.0 million in cost savings already achieved in 2001 and 2002.
For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company's Real Estate segment was adversely affected by market conditions in certain real estate markets where the Company operates. Revenues were $15.9 million for the first half of 2003, representing a $2.9 million, or 16%, decrease from the same period of 2002.
Our overall results for the first half of 2003 were favorably impacted by the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound Sterling and the Euro, which resulted in a decrease in the Company's operating loss of approximately $1.1 million.
"We had a profitable second quarter with expenses very well controlled and we are satisfied with the outcome of the second quarter and first half, given the difficult circumstances that prevailed during the period," said William F. Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. "The build up to the war in Iraq occurred at the prime property gathering period for our major spring sales in New York and directly affected New York consignments." Mr. Ruprecht explained: "While we saw a sizable decline in Auction Sales (-15%) in the second quarter of 2003, auction and related revenues over the same period decreased only a fraction of that (-4%), which demonstrates our ability to effectively withstand an unpredictable environment.
"Our spring Impressionist and Modern art sales in New York and London performed well and Sotheby's led in this important auction category with a combined total of $155.1 million. The resilience of the art market was also evident in a number of other sales, most notably in our American Paintings sale in New York which brought $31.9 million, close to the high estimate, and our July Old Masters sales in London, which brought $38.7 million, well exceeding the high estimate. The demand for works of art that are fresh to the market and of high quality was as strong as ever, despite the challenges of the current global economic and political environment."
In looking to the second half of the year, Mr. Ruprecht noted: "We are encouraged by the level of consignments, which appears to be due in part to the offering in the fall of property withheld from the spring auctions as a result of economic uncertainties related to the build up to the war in Iraq. We are also seeing an improvement in the real estate market, with properties under contract at the end of the second quarter of 2003 at a thirteen-month high for this segment of our business."
Spring/Summer Highlights
Pierre-Auguste Renoir's
Dans les Roses (Portrait de Madame Lon Clapisson)
sold for $23.5 million in New York and was the highest individual price achieved among all the Impressionist and Modern works sold in the New York and London spring sales. The highlight of the June London Impressionist sale was Egon Schiele's landscape painting,
Krumauer Landschaft (Stadt und Fluss)
, which brought
$21.1 million (12.7 million), more than doubling its pre-sale low estimate. This price set a world auction record for the artist and became the highest priced restituted work of art ever auctioned.
        At Sotheby's sale of American Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture in New York, which totaled $31.9 million, the Collection of Meyer and Vivian Potamkin brought in $15.3 million, over $2.0 million above its high estimate. The highest price achieved at the sale was $3.0 million for John Sloan's
Easter Eve
, a painting depicting a nighttime New York scene, setting a record for the artist at auction.
        The July Old Masters sales in London achieved $38.7 million (23.7 million) surpassing its high estimate of $31.5 million by $7.2 million, or 23%. The most notable lot of the sale was Rembrandt's rediscovered
Self-Portrait with Shaded Eyes
which sold for $11.3 million (6.9 million), setting an auction record for a Rembrandt self-portrait. This Rembrandt has a remarkable history, having been hidden behind layers of overpaint for over 300 years when it was transformed into a study of an extravagantly dressed Russian aristocrat. Many other paintings achieved well above their estimates and two other artists, Jean-Marc Nattier and Giulio Cesare Procaccini, also set world records.
        The working manuscript of Ludwig von Beethoven's Ninth Symphony brought $3.5 million (2.1 million) on May 22, setting the auction record for a single musical work as well as for a Beethoven manuscript. This manuscript, the first of the full score ever to come to market, is arguably the single most important musical work ever to come to auction.
nd
        Karl Lagerfeld's collection of Art Deco and Works of Art which was sold in Paris on May 15 was an outstanding success. The contents of his house in Biarritz and his apartment in Monaco, which were primarily Modernist furniture and decorative arts from the 1920's and 30's, achieved $8.0 million in sales, almost tripling its low estimate of $3.0 million.
th
        Sotheby's Asia experienced an excellent spring season, despite the on-going, widespread concern surrounding the SARS viral epidemic that limited travel by many of our international clients. Sales results in Asia totaled $48.0 million for the second quarter of 2003, as compared to $47.7 million in second quarter 2002, with particular strength in the Chinese ceramics market in Hong Kong and the paintings market in Australia.
Upcoming Single Owner Sales
A major highlight of the upcoming auction season is the collection of American fashion legend, Bill Blass. The sale contents come from Mr. Blass' Manhattan apartment and home in Connecticut and are comprised mainly of English furniture, Old Master paintings, Italian bronzes, fine European paintings and Antiquities. The collection will be sold in New York from October 21 to 23 and, with Pablo Picasso's
st
rd
Nu couch
which will be sold in our November Impressionists sale, is expected to achieve in excess of $10.0 million. Also in New York, Sotheby's will be selling the Inventory and Reference Library of H. P. Kraus, the venerable New York dealers in books and manuscripts, which Sotheby's recently acquired directly from the owner. Hans P. Kraus was known to bibliophiles and book collectors the world over as the foremost dealer in rare books and manuscripts of his time and the books and manuscripts, including the renowned reference library, are estimated between $9-12 million.
        On October 15, in Paris, Empire furniture and decorations, works of art, silver, ceramics, carpets, and Old Master drawings from the collection of Barbara Piaseka Johnson, will be auctioned. This wonderful collection was assembled jointly with her late husband, J. Seward Johnson Sr., co-founder of the firm Johnson & Johnson and is expected to achieve $5.0 to $7.0 million. The contents of the London home of world-renowned entertainer and philanthropist Sir Elton John will be auctioned in our London salesroom on September 30. The vast collection of furniture, paintings and works of art from his house in Holland Park is estimated in excess of $1.3 million.

        Sotheby's International Realty (SIR) announced today that it had reached agreement to acquire the business operations of Jackson Hole Realty (JHR), the leading brokerage firm in Jackson Hole and the largest in the state of Wyoming, in a purchase that will become effective on October 28, 2003. At that time, the real estate professionals formerly associated with JHR will become part of SIR's worldwide real estate operations, which include existing brokerage office locations in Jackson and Dubois, Wyoming.
        "This is an outstanding acquisition for Sotheby's International Realty" said Stuart Siegel, President and Chief Executive Officer of SIR. "The Town of Jackson, together with the surrounding Teton County area, has emerged as a leading resort and residential real estate location for domestic and international clients.
        "This acquisition is a wonderful marriage between an extensive and long-established local presence and Sotheby's unequalled national and international reach," Mr. Siegel continued. "It will allow us to provide greatly enhanced services to our shared clients, who will now have the ability to market their properties to a wide range of qualified buyers in the local market and far beyond it."
        G. Bland Hoke, Jr., the current Responsible Broker for Jackson Hole Realty, commented: "This transaction encompasses the best of both worlds: our associates and brokers with sales and marketing expertise in the Jackson Hole area and Sotheby's International Realty's well-established brand, proprietary marketing tools and international network.
        "The local character of our operation and all of our outlying sales offices will remain," said Mr. Hoke. "We have deep roots in this community and an understanding of the many issues that are unique to it. We're committed to retaining our local perspective and insight through this transition, and consider them critical to our success in moving the SIR Jackson Hole Brokerage forward."
        Clayton Andrews, a current JHR shareholder who has been with JHR for twelve years, will lead the local management team, working with Peter Linsey, the manager of SIR's current operations in Jackson Hole.
        SIR currently has offices in the Town of Jackson and in Dubois, Wyoming. With the acquisition, Sotheby's presence in the Jackson Hole market will increase to 14 offices throughout Wyoming and Idaho. Mr. Siegel said that the expanded Jackson Hole operation will complement SIR's existing key locations, which include Manhattan, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Greenwich, Palm Beach and the Hamptons, among others.
        The 19 current shareholders of JHR as well as their sales associates will become sales associates and brokers in SIR's current Jackson Hole brokerage, which, as a result of this move, will operate with a combined sales force of over 100 people.
        Sotheby's International Realty, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc., was founded in 1976 as a natural extension of Sotheby's auction services. Today, the company provides brokerage, marketing and consulting services for luxury residential, resort, farm and ranch properties internationally. For a full listing of the company's offices, affiliates and properties, please visit SIR's Web site at www.sothebysrealty.com.
        SIR's global brokerage operations include company-owned brokerage offices in 20 locations, including the Upper East Side and SoHo in Manhattan; Southampton, Bridgehampton and East Hampton, New York; Palm Beach, Florida; Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Malibu, Santa Barbara and San Francisco, California; Greenwich and Litchfield County, Connecticut; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Sydney, Australia; Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg, Germany; and London. In addition, SIR has brokerage operations in Paris, Portugal and South Africa. The company's five regional offices in Manhattan, Palm Beach, Newport Beach, Boston and Munich, Germany, manage the company's affiliation with more than 175 independent affiliates worldwide.

SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTH RESULTS
 
November 13, 2003, New York  Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID; LSE: STBA), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide live auction businesses, art-related financing and real estate brokerage activities, today announced results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003.
 
For the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company's net loss was ($27.4) million, or ($0.45) per share, compared to a net loss for the third quarter of 2002 of ($43.0) million, or ($0.70) per share, a 36% improvement.  The narrowing of this loss was predominantly due to the significant reductions in employee retention costs and antitrust related special charges when compared to the prior year.  During the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax net charges of $2.7 million, primarily due to employee retention costs and antitrust related special charges principally for settlement administration costs.  Excluding these
 
Impressionist total includes results from the evening and day sales on November 5 and 6 while the Contemporary total only includes results from the Part I evening sale on November 12.

charges, the Company's adjusted net loss would have been ($25.7)** million, or ($0.42)** per share, for the third quarter of 2003.  During the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax net charges of $26.5 million, largely due to the $20.1 million fine imposed on the Company by the European Commission in its antitrust investigation.  Excluding these charges, the Company's net loss would have been ($18.8)** million, or ($0.31)** per share, for the third quarter of 2002.  The Company reported total revenues of $42.3 million for the third quarter of 2003, compared to $48.4 million in the corresponding period of 2002, a decrease of 13%.  This decrease was almost entirely attributable to the sale of Sir Peter Paul Rubens' masterpiece for the record price of $76.7 million in July of 2002, for which there was no comparable sale in the third quarter of 2003.
Massacre of the Innocents
 
During the third quarter of 2003, the Company's Real Estate segment benefited from a rebound in certain real estate markets, with revenues increasing $1.9 million, or 19%, from the same period of 2002.  Real Estate operating income was up for the quarter by approximately 30% to $3.3 million.
 
The third quarter is historically a period of minimal sales activity in the art auction market (typically less than 10% of total annual auction sales for Sotheby's) and, therefore, the Company traditionally reports a loss in the period.
 
Fnet loss was ($40.9) million, or ($0.66) per share, compared to a net loss of ($48.2) million, or ($0.78) per share for the corresponding period of 2002, a 15% improvement, which was primarily due to significantly decreased employee retention costs and antitrust related special charges over the period.  Results for the first nine months of
or the first nine months of 2003,
2003 include pre-tax net charges of $15.8 million, which consist of $8.2 million in employee retention costs, $5.0 million in net restructuring charges and $2.6 million in antitrust related special charges.  Excluding these charges, the Company's adjusted net loss for the first nine months of 2003 would have been ($30.5)** million, or ($0.49)** per share.  Included in the first nine months results of 2002 are pre-tax net charges of $36.0 million,

for the first nine months of 2003
which consist of antitrust related special charges of $19.2 million, employee retention costs of $18.3 million and a net restructuring benefit of $1.5 million.  Excluding these pre-tax charges, adjusted net loss for the first nine months of 2002 would have been ($18.0)** million, or ($0.29)** per share.  The Company reported total revenues of $208.9 million
, compared to $220.8 million for the corresponding period of 2002, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 5%. Again, this was largely due to the sale of the Rubens painting discussed above, as well as lower sales results for our major second quarter spring sales, which was attributable to the unfavorable conditions for property gathering during the lead-up to the war in Iraq.
 
Direct costs were lower for the first nine months of 2003 by $5.7 million, or 16%, when compared to the same period in 2002.  This was due to lower catalogue production costs resulting in part from a strategic decision to decrease the number of lots offered at auction, as well as other cost savings initiatives.  Excluding employee retention costs, net restructuring charges,  antitrust related special charges and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements, total operating expenses for the first nine months of 2003 would have been  $222.6** million, a decrease of $11.8 million, or 5%, when compared to the same period in 2002.
 
"The rebound in the art market that we have seen this fall is very encouraging and our outlook for the fourth quarter is extremely positive," said Mr. William F. Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc.  "Our Impressionist and Contemporary sales led the market at $146.0 million and $74.6, respectively*, with the Impressionist results almost double that of the spring ($81.1 million) and the Contemporary results almost triple that of the spring ($27.3 million) and the second highest Contemporary total since 1989.  These impressive results, along with the sales still to take place this quarter, give us confidence in a promising finish to 2003.  We currently anticipate materially higher fourth quarter results as compared to the fourth quarter of 2002.
Impressionist and Contemporary Sale Results
 
"Last week, Sotheby's was the market leader in the New York fall series of Impressionist and Modern art sales with a total of $146.0* million," said Mr. Ruprecht.  "Sotheby's achieved the highest price for any work of art this season when Gustav Klimt's vibrant landscape of his Austrian summer home sold for $29.1 million, easily surpassing its pre-sale high estimate of $25 million.  This is a record for the artist at auction as well as the highest auction price achieved for an Impressionist work of art at Sotheby's since 1999 (the recent peak of the art market).  Other highlights of the evening were Claude Monet's from his famed seriesand Vincent van Gogh's selling for $10.4 million and $10.3 million, respectively.  During the evening, twenty works achieved prices in excess of $1 million and eight exceeded $5 million.

"Last night, we held a very exciting Part I sale of Contemporary Art in New York which brought $74.6* million, leading the market by a comfortable margin," said Mr. Ruprecht.  "Nineteen works sold for over $1 million and the highlight of the evening was Willem de Kooning's , which came in at $11.2 million, above its low estimate of $10.0 million.  Another noteworthy lot was Mark Rothko's , which brought $8.9 million, above its low estimate of $8.0 million."

Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
In October, Sotheby's held the highly successful single owner sale of the collection of American fashion legend, Bill Blass.  This three day sale in New York of mainly English furniture, Old Master paintings, Italian bronzes and fine European paintings brought in $13.6 million, more than doubling its high estimate of $6.4 million.  All but nine lots of the 800 offered were sold.  In Paris, the collection of Barbara Piaseka Johnson's Empire furniture and decorations, works of art, silver, ceramics, carpets and Old Master drawings  sold very successfully for $6.4 million, above its high estimate of $5.9 million.
 
The October sales in Hong Kong fared very well, totaling $44.9 million, above its low estimate of $44.2 million, with the Chinese Paintings and Ceramics sales achieving $27.6 million, well above the low estimate of $23.2 million.  A new world record for imperial
works of art was set at $3.7 million for a set of scholar seals from the Emperor Qianlong of the Qung Dynasty.
 
Upcoming Sales
 
On November 20, during our Magnificent Jewels sale in Geneva, Sotheby's is offering the largest D color diamond ever to be sold at auction.  This internally flawless stone weighs 103.83 carats and is estimated between $8 and $10 million.  To date, only three other diamonds of perfect color and clarity over 100 carats have ever been sold at auction, all three having previously been sold at Sotheby's in Geneva.

An extraordinary highlight of the fourth quarter will be the sale at auction of Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois.  This house has been compared to Frank Lloyd Wright's as one of the most recognizable landmarks of the modern American architectural world and is estimated between $4.5 and $6.0 million.  It will be sold as the final lot of our 20 Century Design auction on December 12 which also includes two noteworthy single owner sales.  The collection of Seymour Stein, the co-founder of Sire records who is responsible for launching the careers of Madonna, the Pretenders, Depeche Mode, the Ramones and many others, is comprised of Victorian paintings and furniture and decorations from the 1920s and 1930s and is expected to achieve $5 million.  Wolfgang Joop, famed fashion designer and collector of important 20 Century design, is selling the contents of his homes in New York, Germany and Monaco at Sotheby's for an estimated $2.0 - - $2.6 million.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [SOTHEBY'S LOGO] [CENDANT LOGO] SOTHEBY'S AND CENDANT AGREE TO STRATEGIC REAL ESTATE ALLIANCE Cendant Acquires Sotheby's International Realty and Will License Sotheby's International Realty Brand Under a Long-Term Agreement with Sotheby's NEW YORK - February 17, 2004 - Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID; LSE: STBA) and Cendant Corporation (NYSE: CD) announced today that Cendant has acquired the residential real estate brokerage operations of Sotheby's International Realty and entered into an agreement with Sotheby's for a 100-year term, which consists of an initial 50-year term and a 50-year renewal option, whereby Cendant will license the Sotheby's International Realty brand in exchange for a licensing fee to Sotheby's. The total cash purchase price for the company-owned real estate brokerage operations as well as the license agreement was approximately $100 million, plus an ongoing license fee based on future royalties from the development of the Sotheby's International Realty franchise system and company-owned operations. "Sotheby's reviewed its role in the market place as a premier real estate brokerage firm and decided to seek a strategic partner to grow this business more rapidly," said Bill Ruprecht, president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction, real estate and finance operations. "Cendant, which is the premier operator in the residential real estate sector and a proven manager of quality brands, is uniquely suited to be our partner. This new partnership with Cendant and its plans for significant investment over the next couple of years will give both Sotheby's and the Sotheby's International Realty brand dramatically more exposure among high net worth families throughout the United States." Mr. Ruprecht continued: "Last week Sotheby's announced a commitment for a new long-term credit facility of up to $200 million which dramatically expands our financing capacity and is indicative of the growing strength and momentum of our organization. We will invest the funds received from this transaction with Cendant in our core auction business to further build on this momentum and on our position as the world's pre-eminent auction house." "We are proud to add Sotheby's International Realty to our existing family of real estate brands and companies," said Richard A. Smith, chairman and CEO of Cendant's Real Estate Services Division. "Sotheby's International Realty is a leading luxury brand with a prestigious history. We now look forward to building and operating a franchise system that will add significant value to those residential real estate brokerage firms who will become franchisees of Sotheby's International Realty." Sotheby's International Realty will operate under two business units. The company-owned residential real estate brokerage operations will be owned and operated by NRT Incorporated. Stuart Siegel, former president and CEO of Sotheby's International Realty, now becomes senior vice president for NRT with responsibility for the company-owned operations, which do business as Sotheby's International Realty.
Cendant also announced that Michael R. Good has been appointed as the president and CEO of Sotheby's International Realty Corporation, the entity responsible for servicing the current affiliate network as well as the development of the franchise system. Good is a 27-year real estate industry veteran who most recently served as NRT's executive vice president and chief operating officer. European offices and affiliates will continue to operate under the Sotheby's International Realty name, managed by current leadership. These operations will not become part of the Cendant family at this time. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Sotheby's Holdings and Cendant was advised by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) - February 17, 2004 Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Michigan 1-9750 38-2478409 - -------------------------------- ---------------- ------------------- (State or other jurisdiction of (Commission File (IRS Employer incorporation or organization) Number) Identification No.) 38500 Woodward Avenue, Suite 100 Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48303 - ---------------------------------------- ---------------- (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code: (248) 646-2400 ------------------
ITEM 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets On February 17, 2004, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") sold its domestic real estate brokerage business, Sotheby's International Realty, Inc., to a subsidiary of Cendant Corporation ("Cendant") for $100.7 million, which consisted of approximately $98.9 million in cash and the assumption of a $1.8 million note payable. The purchase price is subject to customary, post-closing adjustments. Net cash proceeds from the sale, after deducting approximately $5.0 million in expenses, were $93.9 million. Additionally, in conjunction with the transaction described above, the Company entered into an agreement with Cendant to license the Sotheby's International Realty trademark and certain related trademarks in exchange for an ongoing license fee. The license agreement, which is for an initial 50-year term with a 50-year renewal option, is applicable to Canada, Israel, Mexico, the United States (the "U.S.") and certain Caribbean countries. The other non-U.S. offices and affiliates of the Company's real estate brokerage business, which are not significant to the Company's overall operations, will continue to operate as Sotheby's International Realty under current management. However, Cendant has an option to acquire certain of these offices and affiliates and a license to use the related trademarks in other countries outside the U.S. during the five-year period following February 17, 2004 for a nominal amount.

SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. By: /s/ Michael L. Gillis --------------------- Michael L. Gillis Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer Date: March 2, 2004 -------------

EXHIBIT 99.1 SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods described below show the effect of the sale of the Company's domestic real estate brokerage business, Sotheby's International Realty, Inc. ("SIR"), to a subsidiary of Cendant Corporation ("Cendant"), as well the effect of the Company's agreement with Cendant to license the Sotheby's International Realty trademark and certain related trademarks (the "Cendant License Agreement"). The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by applying pro forma adjustments to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 (the "Historical Financial Statements"). The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 gives effect to the sale of SIR as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2003 and gives effect to the resulting Cendant License Agreement as if it had been entered into on January 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 gives effect to the sale of SIR as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2002 and gives effect to the resulting Cendant License Agreement as if it had been entered into on January 1, 2002. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the sale of SIR as if it had been consummated on September 30, 2003. The pro forma adjustments, as described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements, are estimates based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Historical Financial Statements, including the related notes thereto, and the related management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, which are included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position and results of operations that would have been achieved had the sale of SIR and the Cendant License Agreement been consummated as of the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of the Company's future financial position or results of operations.
Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2003 (Thousands of dollars, except per share data)
Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2003 (1) For purposes of the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the results of SIR exclude the allocation of corporate expenses, which represent expenses of the Company's continuing operations. (2) The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 excludes the following nonrecurring items:
(a) Pre-tax gain on the sale of SIR $ 81,486 (b) Bonuses paid to former SIR employees upon successful completion of the sale $ (1,500) (c) Employee termination benefits related to the sale of SIR $ (670)
Additionally, in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company is due to receive any commissions collected in connection with the closing of any real estate transactions and sales contracts pending as of the date of the agreement. Any such amounts were excluded from the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. (3) The adjustment represents estimated license fees during the period assuming the Cendant License Agreement went into effect on January 1, 2003. (4) The adjustment represents the reduction of interest expense related to the Company's then existing senior secured credit agreement. Specifically, this adjustment assumes the repayment of $100 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement's term facility, as well as reduced revolving credit facility borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. The assumed repayment of the $100 million in term facility borrowings is assumed to be funded by $90.3 million in assumed net proceeds received from the sale of SIR and $10.7 million from the Company's existing cash balances as of January 1, 2003. The pro forma reduction of interest expense as a result of the assumed repayment of outstanding term facility borrowings is not very significant due to the fact that such borrowings were actually refinanced on February 7, 2003 in conjunction with a sale-leaseback transaction involving the Company's headquarters building in New York. The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 assumes that the sale-leaseback transaction would still have been completed as of the same date and on the same terms that were actually achieved, with the net cash proceeds being used to manage the Company's ongoing general corporate cash requirements during the remainder of 2003. (5) The adjustment represents the increase in interest income due to higher cash balances principally resulting from the net cash proceeds received from the sale-leaseback transaction, as discussed in Note (4) above.
(6) The adjustment reflects the income tax impact at an effective tax rate of approximately 32% for the aforementioned items.
Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 (Thousands of dollars, except per share data)
Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 (1) For purposes of the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, the results of SIR exclude the allocation of corporate expenses, which represent expenses of the Company's continuing operations. (2) The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 excludes the following nonrecurring items:
(a) Pre-tax gain on the sale of SIR $ 80,921 (b) Bonuses paid to former SIR employees upon successful completion of the sale $ (1,500) (c) Employee termination benefits related to the sale of SIR $ (670)
Additionally, in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company is due to receive any commissions collected in connection with the closing of any real estate transactions and sales contracts pending as of the date of the agreement. Any such amounts were excluded from the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. (3) The adjustment represents estimated license fees during the period assuming the Cendant License Agreement went into effect on January 1, 2002. (4) The adjustment represents the reduction of interest expense related to the Company's then existing senior secured credit agreement. Specifically, this adjustment assumes the repayment of $130 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement's term facility, as well as reduced revolving credit facility borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2002. The assumed repayment of the $130 million in term facility borrowings is assumed to be funded by $89.3 million in assumed net proceeds received from the sale of SIR and $40.7 million from the Company's existing cash balances as of January 1, 2002. (5) The adjustment represents the reduction of interest income due to lower cash balances. (6) The adjustment reflects the income tax impact at an effective tax rate of approximately 34% for the aforementioned items.
Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet As of September 30, 2003 (Thousands of dollars)
Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet As of September 30, 2003 (1) For purposes of the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet, the assets and liabilities of SIR exclude the allocation of corporate assets and liabilities, which represent assets and liabilities of the Company's continuing operations. (2) The adjustment reflects the net cash inflow directly resulting from the sale of SIR as follows:
Cash received from the sale of SIR $100,670 (8) Assumed funding of SIR working capital deficit upon closing of transaction (6,129) Transaction costs related to the sale of SIR (5,000) Taxes paid prior to closing of transaction (4,293) Assumed repayment of outstanding borrowings (35,000)(4) Bonuses paid to former SIR employees upon successful completion of the sale (1,500) Termination benefits paid to a former SIR employee (670) -------- $ 48,078 ========
(3) The adjustment reflects the tax effect at approximately 38% of the gain on the sale of SIR. (4) The adjustment reflects the assumed repayment of $35 million in outstanding borrowings under the Company's then existing senior secured revolving credit facility. (5) The adjustment represents the elimination entries required to reflect the deconsolidation of SIR. (6) The adjustment reflects the after-tax income effect of the sale of SIR and the elimination entry required to reflect the previous consolidation of SIR, as follows:
Gain on the sale of SIR, net of taxes $50,504 (7) Bonuses paid to former SIR employees upon successful completion of the sale (1,500) Employee termination benefits related to the sale of SIR (670) Consolidation elimination 2,025 ------- $50,359 =======
(7) The gain on the sale of SIR, net of taxes, is calculated as follows:
Cash received from the sale of SIR $100,670 (8) Assumed funding of SIR working capital deficit upon closing of transaction (6,129) Transaction costs related to the sale of SIR (5,000) -------- Net proceeds 89,541 Less: SIR net assets as of September 30, 2003 (7,674) -------- Gain on sale of SIR 81,867 Income taxes at approximately 38% (31,363) -------- Gain on the sale of SIR, net of taxes $ 50,504 ========
(8) Upon the sale of SIR on February 17, 2004, the Company received total consideration of $100.7 million, which consisted of $98.9 million in cash and the assumption of a $1.8 million note payable. The pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2003 assumes that the consideration received consisted only of cash due to the fact that the $1.8 million note payable assumed by Cendant Corporation was not a liability of SIR as of September 30, 2003.

If the Purchaser does not deliver the Closing Date Balance Sheet prior to the expiration of 120 days after the Closing Date and the Seller does not, within 120 days following the Closing Date, provide the Purchaser with written notice that it believes that the Estimated Working Capital or the Estimated Indebtedness did not reflect the Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness, respectively, then the Estimated Working Capital and the Estimated Indebtedness, as applicable, shall constitute the Closing Date Working Capital and/or the Closing Date Indebtedness, as applicable, and shall be final and binding on the parties. The Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Date Indebtedness shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with prior periods based on the books and records of the Company and shall be certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Purchaser in his official capacity. (ii) Until the Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Date Indebtedness have become final in accordance with Section 2.4(a), the Purchaser shall 15
(i) provide the Seller and its authorized representatives with access to its and the Company's working papers, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to have their accountants to provide access to their working papers (subject to the expectation by the Seller of a customary indemnification agreement with such accountants), and (iii) provide reasonable access to the books and records, assets and liabilities and senior financial staff of the Company (and otherwise will cooperate with the Seller and its authorized representatives), to the extent relevant to the determination of the Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Date Indebtedness. (iii) If the Seller in good faith disagrees with the Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital or Closing Date Indebtedness as set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Seller may within sixty (60) days after receipt thereof deliver a written notice to the Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts comprising the Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness as to which the Seller disagrees and the basis of such disagreement to the extent known by the Seller. If no such notice of disagreement is timely delivered, the Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Date Indebtedness shall be final and binding on the parties. (iv) If (A) a notice of disagreement shall be timely delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(iii), or (B) the Purchaser does not timely deliver the Closing Date Balance Sheet, and pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(i), the Seller timely delivers written notice that they believe the Estimated Working Capital or the Estimated Indebtedness should be changed, the Seller and the Purchaser shall, during the thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts. If such an agreement is reached, the Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness as so agreed shall be final and binding on the parties. If, at the end of such period, the parties are unable to reach such an agreement, the New York City office of a nationally recognized accounting firm not then acting as the principal outside accountant for the Company, the Seller or the Purchaser and as mutually agreed by the Purchaser and the Seller (the "Accounting Referee"), shall be retained by the parties to review promptly this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts. If the parties are unable to agree mutually upon an Accounting Referee then each party shall select a nationally recognized accounting firm. Such two (2) nationally recognized accounting firms shall then in turn mutually select a separate nationally recognized accounting firm not then acting as the principal outside accountant for the Company, the Seller or the Purchaser who shall then be designated as the "Accounting Referee." In connection therewith, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness as to which the Seller has disagreed. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Referee to deliver to the Seller and the Purchaser, as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of being referred the matter, a report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Indebtedness (including any adjustments to non-disputed items necessary as a result of changes to disputed items) and the calculations supporting such adjustments. Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties and the Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness, as adjusted pursuant to such 16
report, shall be final and binding on the parties. The cost of the Accounting Referee's review and report shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the Seller. (v) If the Estimated Working Capital is negative and exceeds the final Closing Date Working Capital, then the Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price, with interest as provided in Section 2.4(b), the amount of such excess. If the Estimated Working Capital is positive and exceeds the final Closing Date Working Capital, then the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller, as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price, with interest as provided in Section 2.4(b), the amount of such excess. If the final Closing Date Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price, with interest as provided in Section 2.4(b), an amount equal to the amount of such excess. (vi) If the Estimated Indebtedness reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet exceeds the final Closing Date Indebtedness, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price, with interest as provided in Section 2.4(b), the amount of such excess. If the final Closing Date Indebtedness reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet exceeds the Estimated Indebtedness, then the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price, with interest as provided in Section 2.4(b), the amount of such excess. (vii) If a party to this Agreement is both required to make a payment and entitled to receive a payment pursuant to Sections 2.4(a)(v) and 2.4(a)(vi), then such party shall have the right, upon written notice to the other party, to offset its obligation to make such payment by the amount of the payment that it is entitled to receive from the party pursuant to such Sections. (b) Payments and Interest. Any payments pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts at United States banks designated in writing by the Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be. Any amount due pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall bear interest for the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the payment date at the rate of three percent (3%) per annum.

(b) No consent, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made (other than any obtained or made prior to the Closing) by the Seller or the Company in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, that has not been obtained or made, as applicable, except (i) with respect to any Permits the loss of which due to the sale of the Shares cannot be cured by a routine re-filing for such Permit with the applicable Governmental Authority without any material cost, (ii) where the failure to obtain or make any such consent, order, authorization, registration, declaration or filing, individually or the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to be material or (iii) for any consent, order or authorization of, or 19

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the absence of footnotes) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved and fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Business as of the dates thereof and the results of operations for the periods then ended, except to the extent that historical retained earnings relating to the operation of the business of the Mortgage LLC have not been excluded therefrom.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6, the Company owns, or otherwise has a valid leasehold or licensee interest providing sufficient and legally enforceable (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)) rights to use, all of the property, assets and rights necessary or material to its conduct of the Business as currently conducted (other than the Support Services and the services to be provided under the Transition Services Agreement) or otherwise used or held for use by it in the Business. 22
Set forth on Schedule 3.6(a) is a list which is true and correct (to the knowledge of Seller) in all material respects of all material fixed assets of the Business as of the date hereof. The Company has good title (including a license or leasehold interest, as applicable) to all properties, assets and rights reflected on the Balance Sheet or acquired since the Balance Sheet Date, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens, other than properties, assets and rights which are not in the aggregate material. Such material assets reflected on the Balance Sheet or acquired since the Balance Sheet Date are, considered in the aggregate, in reasonable operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) in all material respects, and have been reasonably maintained in all material respects. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller is not in any event making any representations or warranties in this Section 3.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement as to the title or condition of any of the Excluded Assets. (b) The Company does not own any real property and the Company has not acquired or disposed of any ownership interest in any real property since December 31, 2001. Schedule 3.6(b) identifies (i) each lease, sublease or other occupancy agreement pursuant to which real property is leased by the Company, or by Seller or one of its Affiliates on behalf of the Company, including any real property owned by Seller or its Affiliates and leased to the Company (any such leased real property, "Real Property", and any such Person leasing any such Real Property, a "Lessee"), and each amendment, modification or extension of any such lease (collectively, the "Leases"), (ii) the Lessee thereof and (iii) the name of the lessor thereof. Each Lessee has a good and valid leasehold interest under each Lease to which it is a party pursuant to which such Lessee has the right to use the Real Property demised by such Lease in accordance with the terms of such Lease, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens. To the Seller's knowledge, the current use of the Real Property by the Company does not violate in any material respect the certificate of occupancy thereof, any local zoning or similar land use or other Laws or the applicable Lease. The Company has not received written notice of any pending or threatened condemnation proceeding, or of any sale or other disposition in lieu of condemnation, affecting any of the Real Property that it leases under any Lease.

To the Seller's knowledge, no monetary or material non-monetary default exists by the Company under any Sublease. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6(b), to the Seller's knowledge, no subtenant is in monetary or material non-monetary default, and no condition or event exists which with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both would constitute a monetary or material non-monetary default by any subtenant under any Sublease. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6(b), no Real Property is used by any Lessee for any purpose other than the conduct of the Business. (c) The Seller has delivered or made available to the Purchasers a copy of each Lease (or in the case of oral agreements a summary of the material terms thereof) that is correct and complete in all material respects. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6(c), and in any event except to the extent that with respect to such Lease, the same could not reasonably be expected to be material, (i) each Lease is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Lessee thereunder, 23
enforceable against such Lessee in accordance with its terms (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (ii) none of the Leases or Subleases has been modified in any material respect except (and only to the extent set forth therein) by a written amendment specifically identified as such in Schedule 3.6(b), (iii) other than with respect to matters covered by Section 3.3(a), neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Seller, any landlord or any other party to any Lease or any Sublease, is in material breach or default under any Lease or any Sublease, and no event or circumstance exists or has occurred which, with the delivery of notice, the passage of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a material breach or default under any Lease or any Sublease by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Seller, any other party thereto, (v) to the Seller's knowledge, the full amount of the security deposit, if any, required to be deposited with respect to any Lease or any Sublease is on deposit as so required, and (vi) the Company has not collaterally assigned or granted any security interest in any Lease or any Sublease or any interest therein other than in connection with any Lien to be released at the Closing. (d) To the knowledge of Seller, no account receivable of the Business is owned by any Person other than the Company. (e) To the knowledge of Seller, all of the Improvements are, considered in the aggregate, in reasonably good condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) in all material respects. (f) All Improvements located on any Real Property are adequately supplied, in all material respects, with utilities (including water, sewage, disposal, electricity, gas and telephone) and other services necessary for their operation as the same are currently operated. To the knowledge of the Seller, there are no pending, planned, threatened or proposed cutbacks, moratoriums, restrictions or other limitations or impairments of any of the foregoing as they would materially affect any Real Property. Section 3.7 Litigation and Claims; Compliance with Laws. (a) Schedule 3.7(a) sets forth all Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Seller, threatened with respect to Business, including a reasonably detailed description thereof.

In connection with the foregoing, the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such amendments to such Leases as may be commercially reasonable to give effect to the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially reasonable efforts shall not require the Purchaser to pay any consideration to replace the Lease Security other than offering the replacement letter of credit or guarantee referred to above. Upon demand, Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for all costs, claims and expenses incurred by the Seller under or in respect of any Lease Security (including any payment by Seller or any of its Affiliates under any such guarantee or in respect of reimbursement of any drawing of any such letters of credit) after the Closing Date.

(a) The Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company for all Pre-Closing Periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date (such Tax Returns, the "Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns") (provided that the Seller shall submit a draft of any such Tax Return required to be filed by the Company on a stand-alone basis to the Purchaser for its review at least five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return). All such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns, to the extent they relate to the Company, shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company, except as required by applicable Law. The Seller shall file all such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns, provided, however, if any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return is due after the Closing and the Seller is not authorized to file such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return by Law, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall file (or cause to be filed) such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return as prepared by Seller (in accordance with this Section 6.1(a)) with the appropriate Tax authorities. The Seller shall pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of all Pre-Closing Period Taxes and Tax Returns; provided, however, that if any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return is due after the Closing and is to be filed (or caused to be filed) by the Purchaser, the Seller shall pay (in immediately available funds) all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Tax Return to the Purchaser no later than three (3) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. The Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in the filing of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. (b) The Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause the Company to prepare and timely file, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company for all Straddle Periods (such Tax Returns, the "Straddle Period Tax Returns"). All Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company, except as required by applicable Law. The Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered drafts of all Straddle Period Tax Returns to the Seller for its review at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any such Straddle Period Tax Return (taking into account valid extensions) and shall notify the Seller of the Purchaser's calculation of the Seller's share of the Taxes of the Company for any such Straddle Periods (determined in accordance with Section 6.3(c)); provided, however, that such drafts of any such Straddle Period Tax Returns and such calculations of the Seller's share of the Tax liability for such Straddle Period (determined in accordance with Section 6.3(c)) shall be subject to the Seller's review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Seller disputes any item on such Straddle Period Tax Return, it shall notify the Purchaser (by written notice within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of the Purchaser's calculation) of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its 48
objection. If the Seller does not object by written notice within such period, the Purchaser's calculation of the Seller's share of the Taxes for such Straddle Period shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for all purposes hereof. The Purchaser and the Seller shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the Tax Return is required to be filed. If the Purchaser and the Seller cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by an independent auditor mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller as promptly as practicable. The fees and expenses of the independent auditor shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Seller. No later than three (3) days prior to the filing of such Straddle Period Tax Return, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser in immediately available funds the amount of the Seller's share of the Tax liability for the Straddle Period determined pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) and in accordance with the principles of Section 6.3(c). Subject to the preceding sentence and Section 6.3(a), the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due and payable in respect of all such Straddle Period Tax Returns. Section 6.2 Section 338(h)(10) Election. (a) The Purchaser, the Seller and their respective Affiliates shall jointly make a timely and effective election provided for by Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations and any comparable election under state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the purchase of the capital stock of the Company (each, an "Election" and collectively, the "Elections"). The Purchaser, the Seller and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate, including filing such additional forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required to effect and preserve timely Elections in accordance with the provisions of Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations (and any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law) or any successor provisions. Specifically, the Seller and the Purchaser shall, within five (5) days prior to the date such forms are required to be filed under applicable law, exchange completed and executed copies of the Internal Revenue Service Forms 8023 and 8883, required schedules thereto, and any similar state, local or foreign forms. If changes are required in any of these forms as a result of information which is first available after the date on which any such form is completed and executed pursuant to the preceding sentence, the parties will act in good faith to agree on such changes. The Seller, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall report the purchase by the Purchaser of the Shares of the Company consistent with the Election and shall take no position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any Tax authority or otherwise. (b) In connection with the Elections, within ninety (90) days after the Closing, the Purchaser (or its Affiliate) shall provide to the Seller the proposed manner in which the "aggregate deemed sales price," as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-4, with respect to the Company shall be allocated among its assets, which allocations shall be made in accordance with Section 338(b) of the Code and any applicable Treasury Regulations and shall reflect the Share Purchase Price. Within fifteen (15) Business Days following the receipt of such proposed allocations, the Seller shall have the right to object to such allocations (by written 49
notice to the Purchaser), and if the Seller objects, it shall notify the Purchaser (in such written notice) of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection and the Purchaser and the Seller shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute for the thirty (30) day period thereafter. If the Seller does not object by written notice within such period, such proposed allocations shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that such proposed allocation shall be subject to adjustment upon and as a result of the final determination of the Share Purchase Price (taking into account any adjustments pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof). If, within thirty (30) days of the Seller's delivery of a notice of objection, the parties have not reached an agreement regarding such allocations, the dispute shall be presented to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser, whose determination shall be binding on both parties.

Closing Date and as determined in the manner provided in Section 6.3(c) of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all Taxes related to any Election and the transactions contemplated pursuant to Section 3.22 of this Agreement but excluding any Taxes resulting from any transaction that is not in the ordinary course of business that occurs on the Closing Date but after the Closing and is not contemplated by this Agreement); (iv) all liabilities for Taxes imposed on the Company under section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (and corresponding provisions of state, local, or foreign Law) as a result of having been a member of any federal, state, local or foreign consolidated, unitary, combined or similar group for any taxable period ending on or before, or that includes, the Closing Date; (v) all liabilities for Taxes imposed on or related or attributable to the Excluded Companies, Listing Exchange, LLC or Mortgage LLC; (vi) all liabilities (including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) arising from any breach by the Seller or its Affiliates of any of the covenants and obligations contained in this Article VI; (vii) all liabilities (including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) arising from the breach or inaccuracy of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.12(e) of this Agreement; and (viii) all liabilities relating to net Tax liabilities imposed on the Company as a result of the transactions or any action contemplated pursuant to Section 5.10 hereof.

(c) For purposes of this Section 6.3, in order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent required or permitted under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company for all Tax purposes. In any case where applicable Law does not permit the Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be: 51
(i) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (such as real property taxes), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in (i) (such as (x) taxes that are based upon or measured by income or receipts or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) and (y) payroll and similar Taxes), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the Closing Date. (d) All amounts payable or to be paid under this Section 6.3 (the "Tax Indemnity Payments") shall be paid in immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after the later of (i) the receipt of a written request from the Indemnified Party entitled to such Tax Indemnity Payment and (ii) the date payment of the amount that is the subject of the Tax Indemnity Payment by the Indemnified Party entitled to receive the Tax Indemnity Payment is due to the relevant Taxing Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Tax that is contested with a Tax authority in accordance with Section 6.5 of this Agreement, the day of payment will not be earlier than three (3) days after the date a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code) has occurred. Any amounts that are not paid within such required period shall accrue interest at an annual rate of three percent (3%) per year. (e) In connection with this Article VI, the Seller hereby (i) waives any right of contribution or indemnification or similar right it may have against the Company for any amounts paid by the Seller hereunder, and (ii) waives any defense based on fault of the Company. (f) Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7.5(d) of this Agreement. Section 6.4 Tax Refunds. The Purchaser shall pay to the Seller (a) all refunds or credits of Taxes (including any interest in respect thereof) received by the Purchaser or the Company after the Closing Date and attributable to Taxes paid by the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Period and (b) a portion of all refunds or credits of Taxes (including any interest in respect thereof) received by the Purchaser or the Company after the Closing Date and attributable to Taxes paid by the Company with respect to any Straddle Period (such portion to be allocated consistent with the principles set forth in Section 6.3(c)), in each case, net of any Taxes imposed on the portion of such refund treated as interest income arising in a Post-Closing Period; provided, however, that the Seller shall not be entitled to any refund attributable to a carryback to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period of a Tax attribute of the Company that arises in a period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. Any such refunds or credits required to be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller shall be paid within five (5) Business 52
Days of the receipt of any such refunds or credits by Purchaser, the Company, or any of their Affiliates. Upon Seller's reasonable request, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Seller to amend any Tax Return of the Company relating to a Pre-Closing Period (including in the preparation and filing of such amended Tax Return) if such amendment would entitle the Seller to a refund or credit for such Pre-Closing Period (and the Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the Purchaser's (or its Affiliates') cooperation in the preparation and filing of such Tax Return); provided, however, that (i) any such amended Tax Return must be prepared and filed in accordance with applicable law, (ii) Seller shall submit a draft of any amended Tax Return to be filed by the Company on a stand-alone basis to the Purchaser for its review at least five (5) Business Days prior to the filing of such amended Tax Return, and (iii) such amendment shall not have any adverse effect upon any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) for any taxable period for which the Seller is not required to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Seller (and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company) to cooperate with Seller) in the event that Seller elects to pursue a redetermination of New York State franchise and/or income Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period on a combined unitary basis with the Seller and certain of its Affiliates, and Purchaser acknowledges that such redetermination will not have an adverse effect on Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company) in a Post-Closing Tax Period. The Seller shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed of developments with respect to any such pursuit of a redetermination; provided that nothing herein shall require the Seller to provide the Purchaser with copies of Tax Returns of the Seller or any affiliated, combined or unitary group of which Seller or any of its Affiliates are a member, even if such combined, affiliated or unitary group includes the Company. For purposes of this Section 6.4, a credit shall be treated as having been received not prior to the time such credit has been applied to reduce Taxes that would otherwise have been required to be paid. Section 6.5 Tax Indemnification Procedures. (a) If a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim (a "Tax Claim") shall be delivered or sent to or commenced or initiated against the Company by any Tax authority with respect to Taxes for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the Seller, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Seller in writing of the Tax Claim, and shall include a copy of the relevant Tax Claim notice; provided, that the failure by a Purchaser Indemnified Party to promptly notify the Seller of any such notice shall not release the Seller from its obligations under this Article VI in whole or in part except to the extent that the Seller is materially and adversely prejudiced as a consequence of such failure. (b) With respect to Tax Claims of or relating to Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Period, the Seller may, upon written notice to the Purchaser (such written notice to be provided within thirty (30) days after notice of the Tax Claim has been given to the Seller), assume and control the defense of such Tax Claim at its own cost and expense and with its own 53
counsel and, subject to the provisions below, may (i) pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Tax authority, (ii) either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or (iii) contest, settle or compromise the Tax Claim in any permissible manner, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to cooperate with the Seller in pursuing such contest. If the Seller elects to assume the defense of any such Tax Claim, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the Seller shall not enter into any settlement with respect to any such Tax Claim without the Purchaser's (or its Affiliate's) prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such settlement could reasonably be expected to increase the Tax liability of the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) for any taxable period for which the Seller has not indemnified the Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.3; (ii) the Seller shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim (including reasonably promptly forwarding copies to the Purchaser of any related correspondence and shall use reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser with an opportunity to review and comment on any material correspondence before the Seller sends such correspondence to any Tax Authority); and (iii) at its own cost and expense, the Purchaser (or its Affiliate) shall have the right to participate in (but not to control) the defense of such Tax Claim. (c) In connection with the contest of any Tax Claim that relates to (i) any taxable Period beginning after the Closing Date and (ii) any Tax Claim that the Seller has the ability to control but does not timely elect to control pursuant to Section 6.5(b), such contest shall be controlled by the Purchaser (and the Seller shall reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates relating to a Tax Claim described in clause (ii)), and the Seller agrees to cooperate fully with the Purchaser and its Affiliates in pursuing such contest; provided, however, that none of the Purchaser, the Company nor any of their Affiliates shall enter into any settlement with respect to a Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In connection with any contest that relates to Section 6.5(c)(ii) hereof, the Purchaser or its Affiliate shall keep the Seller informed of all material developments and the Seller, at its own cost and expense, shall have the right to participate (including participation in any relevant meetings) in (but not control) the defense of such Tax Claim. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the Purchaser's (or any the Purchaser Indemnified Party's) right to indemnification under this Article VI. (d) The Purchaser and Seller shall jointly control (at each party's own cost) all proceedings in connection with any Tax Claim relating solely to a Straddle Period. The parties agree to cooperate with each other in pursuing any such contest and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall (or shall permit any of their Affiliates to) settle a Tax Claim relating solely to a Straddle Period without the other party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the procedure for indemnification claims with regard to Taxes of or relating to the Company shall be governed exclusively by this Section 6.5. 54
Section 6.6 Transfer and Similar Taxes. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller and the Purchaser shall each pay one-half of all sales, value added, use, privilege, transfer, documentary, gains, stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties, interest or additions) imposed upon any party incurred as a result of the sale of the Shares (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes"), and the Seller and the Purchaser agree to jointly prepare and timely file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to, any Transfer Tax. Section 6.7 Termination of Tax Indemnification Agreements. The Seller hereby agrees and covenants that any and all Tax Indemnification Agreements that may have been entered into by the Seller or its Affiliates and the Company shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date, and no payments to or from the Company pursuant to any such Tax Indemnification Agreement shall be made after such termination. Except for powers of attorney listed on Schedule 3.12(a)(ix), the Seller hereby agrees and covenants that any and all powers of attorney granted by the Company shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the provisions set forth in this Article VI shall survive (30) days after the expiration of applicable statute of limitations (taking into account all valid extensions) for the applicable Taxes or Tax Return to which the provision relates, provided, however, in the event notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 6.3 of this Agreement shall have been given within the applicable survival period, the provisions that are the subject of the indemnification claim shall survive with respect to such claims until such time as such claim is finally resolved. In the event of a conflict between this Article VI and any other provision of this Agreement, this Article VI shall govern and control. In the event of a conflict between this Article VI and Section 5.5 of the License Agreement, Section 5.5 of the License Agreement shall govern and control. Section 6.9 Tax Treatment.

If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of any such third party claim within the Election Period, then the Indemnified Party shall defend or settle such third party claim in a diligent and commercially reasonable manner and in good faith and may settle such third party claim on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate; provided, however, that such Indemnified Party shall not, in defense of such a third party claim, be permitted to admit any liability with respect to, or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, any such third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any liability for any such admission, settlement, compromise, discharge or consent to judgment made by an Indemnified Party without such prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. An 61
Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) any defense assumed by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 7.5(a), and an Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such third party claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Party shall pay all fees and expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party prior to such Indemnifying Party's assumption of such defense. (b) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such third party claim, the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this Article VII shall include taking all steps deemed necessary by the Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, in the investigation, defense or settlement of such third party claim (including the retention of legal counsel) and the Indemnifying Party shall, as a condition to assuming such defense, acknowledge that it will hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and all Damages caused by or arising out of any settlement approved by the Indemnifying Party or any judgment in such claim (subject to the applicable deductibles, caps and limitations set forth in Section 7.4). The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party as to the existence of any offers to settle such third party claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall not settle a third party claim if to the knowledge of the Indemnifying Party (after notifying and consulting with the Indemnified Party) such action would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse impact on the Indemnified Party or the Business; otherwise the Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and settlement, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that such Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in (but not control) such defense or settlement through separate counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party, with the fees and expenses of such participation and separate counsel borne solely by such Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, in the defense of a third party claim, make any payment of any of such claims, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or proposed settlement (i) involves only the payment of money damages and does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of law, (ii) includes, as an unconditional term thereof, a release of such Indemnified Party given by the claimant or the plaintiff from any liabilities arising from such third party claim, and (iii) does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief, directly or indirectly, upon such Indemnified Party or result in an admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. (c) Indemnified Parties and Indemnifying Parties shall cooperate reasonably in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial compromise, settlement or discharge of any third party claim, including, without limitation, by providing the other party with reasonable access to employees, directors and officers (as witnesses) and other information. 62
(d) With respect to any Damages as to which an Indemnified Party has the right to receive Recoveries, the Indemnified Party shall at its option either: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to collect, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, any such Recoveries or (ii) assign any such right to receive Recoveries to the Indemnifying Party, to the extent any such claim is capable of assignment and without making any representation as to or bearing any responsibility for the effectiveness of such assignment. To the extent the Indemnified Party collects any Recoveries with respect to Damages, the amount of Damages to be paid by the Indemnifying Party shall be reduced by the amount of Recoveries so collected. In the event that the Indemnified Party collects any Recoveries with respect to Damages as to which the Indemnified Party previously received payments from the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnified Party shall transfer to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Recoveries collected, up to the amount of Damages paid in connection therewith by the Indemnifying Party. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Section 6.5 shall apply exclusively to all third party claims with regard to Taxes of or relating to the Company. Section 7.6 Indemnity Payments. All indemnity payments owed under this Article VII ("Indemnity Payments"), shall be paid in immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after final determination (which is final in the sense that it is no longer subject to appeal) and written request therefor by the Indemnified Party. All such Indemnity Payments shall be made to the accounts and in the manner specified in writing by the party entitled to such Indemnity Payments. Any amounts that are not paid within such ten day period shall accrue interest at an annual rate of three percent (3%). Section 7.7 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Article VI, except to the extent arising from any fraud, the indemnification provided by this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of (i) any breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement and (ii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than the License Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby). The forgoing shall not limit the parties' right to obtain specific performance in accordance with Section 9.10 hereof with respect to breaches of agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law, and agrees in any case not to assert in any action or proceeding of any kind, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may now or hereafter have (including any such rights, claims or causes of action arising under or based upon common law or other Law) against any Indemnifying Party for any matter described in the previous sentence other than claims for indemnification asserted as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Article VI and Article VII. ARTICLE VIII GUARANTEE Section 8.1 Guarantee. Purchaser Guarantor hereby unconditionally and absolutely guarantees (this "Guarantee"), as a primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full and punctual payment and performance of all debts, obligations and liabilities, whether such 63
obligations are direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now existing or subsequently arising, primary or secondary, now due or hereafter falling due, monetary or otherwise, of Purchaser or any Permitted Assignee under this Agreement, together with all costs of collection, compromise or enforcement, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred with respect to any such debt, obligations or liabilities, or with respect to this or any other guaranty of any of them, or with respect to a proceeding under the federal bankruptcy laws or any moratorium, insolvency, receivership, arrangement or reorganization law or an assignment for the benefit of creditors concerning Purchaser Guarantor, Purchaser or any Permitted Assignee, together with interest on all such costs of collection, compromise or enforcement from the date arising (collectively, the "Obligations"). Purchaser Guarantor further agrees that its liability under this Guarantee shall not be discharged, impaired, diminished or otherwise affected by any (i) extension, settlement, modification, compromise, waiver, release or renewal of any Obligation, in whole or in part or (ii) any modification or amendment or supplement to this Agreement. This Guarantee is a continuing guarantee, which shall apply to all Obligations which now exist or subsequently arise, whether or not notice of such Obligations is given to Purchaser Guarantor, whether or not any or all prior Obligations had been fully paid, performed and observed before any such Obligation arose, and notwithstanding Purchaser Guarantor's dissolution Section 8.2 Waiver of Notices, Etc. Purchaser Guarantor agrees that Seller shall not be required to give Purchaser Guarantor any notice pursuant to this Guarantee, and that no failure to give any notice shall discharge, impair, diminish or otherwise affect the liability which Purchaser Guarantor would have had under this Guarantee if notice had been given. Purchaser Guarantor waives: (i) notice of acceptance of this Guarantee, (ii) notice of the incurring of additional or increased Obligations, (iii) notice of the application of any payment, transfer or recovery from security, (iv) presentment, demand and protest of any instrument, and notice thereof, (v) notice of nonpayment or other default under this Guarantee or under any Obligation, (vi) any right to demand public foreclosure sale of any security, (vii) notice of foreclosure, (viii) notice of any release, discharge, modification or failure to obtain any security for any of the Obligations, (ix) notice of any waiver by Seller of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any of the Obligations, (x) notice of the granting of any indulgence or extension of time to Purchaser or any Permitted Assignee, (xi) notice of any modification, supplement or extension of any of the Obligations, (xii) notice of any agreement or arrangement with Purchaser, any Permitted Assignee or any other Person, (xiii) any right to exoneration or to require election of remedies, (xiv) all suretyship defenses and (xv) any other defenses or notice requirements which may exist at law or in equity. The obligations of Purchaser Guarantor under this Article VIII shall not be affected by (A) the failure of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Purchaser or any Permitted Assignee under the provisions of this Agreement or (B) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement. Purchaser Guarantor further agrees that this Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and performance when due and not of collection and waives any right to require that any resort be had by Seller to any other guarantee or any security held for payment or performance of the Obligations. 64
Section 8.3 Reinstatement. Purchaser Guarantor agrees that this Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or performance, or any part thereof, on any Obligation (including any payment pursuant to this Guarantee) is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by Seller upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Purchaser or any Permitted Assignee or otherwise. Section 8.4 Waiver of Subrogation; Subordination. Purchaser Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity whatsoever, nor any right of recourse to security for the Obligations, except when and so long as all of the Obligations have been fully paid, performed and observed, and have not been reinstated by reason of the avoidance of any transfer, the return of any payment, or otherwise. All present and future debts, obligations and liabilities of Purchaser or any Permitted Assignee to Purchaser Guarantor are hereby waived and postponed in favor of and subordinated to the full payment, performance and observance of the Obligations, and Purchaser Guarantor agrees to assign and deliver to Seller on request, as security for this Guarantee, (a) any such debts, obligations or liabilities, (b) any instruments or documents evidencing the same, (c) any security therefor and (d) any payments or transfers with respect thereto, or recoveries on security therefor, received by Purchaser Guarantor after default under any of the Obligations. Section 8.5 Successors and Assigns. The benefit of this Guarantee shall run to Seller and its heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. The burden of this Guarantee shall bind Purchaser Guarantor and its heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. This Guarantee shall apply to the Obligations of Purchaser and any Permitted Assignee and of such Person's heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, including the successor to any such Person upon any merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of such Person and, including any transferee of all or substantially all of the assets of Purchaser or any Permitted Assignee to any Person which carries on the business of Purchaser or any such Permitted Assignee.

The use of a trade or corporate name (including an assumed name or d/b/a) by a Branded Franchisee or Branded Broker Affiliate that contains a word or name that would be reasonably likely to be interpreted to denote brand segmentation shall not be prohibited by this Section 3.2(b), including by way of example and not of limitation, a Branded Franchisee whose trade name is PREMIER PROPERTIES SOTHEBY'S INTERNATIONAL REALTY. No Branded Owned Office or Company Affiliate may have a corporate or trade name or use an assumed name or d/b/a that includes any word or name that, when combined with any Licensed Mark, could be interpreted to denote any brand segmentation prohibited by this Section 3.2(b). Section 3.3. Alliance Marketing. Subject to Section 3.4, in connection with any proposed agreements between Licensee or any Company Affiliate and any third party pursuant to which Licensee or any Branded Operator would co-market with third-party providers of products 16
or services offered or marketed to home owners or home buyers (or prospective home buyers) (any such Person, a "Co-Marketer") the products or services of such Co-Marketer, including in connection with the Licensee Group's "alliance marketing program," Licensee shall only have the right to include any Licensed Mark in any co-marketing materials created in connection with such agreement with any Co-Marketer if (a) the products or services relating to such co-marketing arrangements shall be performed by the Co-Marketer and not by the Licensee or any Branded Operator and (b) Licensor has approved such Co-Marketer in advance of any such agreement as provided below. In the event that Licensee or any Company Affiliate proposes to enter into an agreement with any Co-Marketer involving any use of any Licensed Mark, Licensee shall submit to Licensor a written request for approval of such Co-Marketer including a template or mock-up or representative sample demonstrating such intended use, whereupon Licensor may request such additional information as it may reasonably deem relevant to evaluating such request. If Licensor does not object to any proposed Co-Marketer within ten Business Days following receipt of all information requested pursuant to the preceding sentence, Licensor shall be deemed to have approved the proposed Co-Marketer. Licensee shall cause any co-marketing materials to include a disclaimer providing that such Co-Marketer's products or services are not provided by Holdings, any Licensor Affiliate or any Branded Operator, as applicable, and the use of the Licensed Marks in any co-marketing materials shall comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The right under this Section 3.3 is a right to co-market the Authorized Services with the services or products of an approved Co-Marketer and in no event shall this Section 3.3 be interpreted to expand the scope of the Authorized Services that may be offered and sold under the Licensed Marks. Section 3.4. Trademark Usage Guidelines. (a) Any use of a Licensed Mark, including in combination with any other Mark of Licensee, must comply with the Trademark Usage Guidelines (i) in all respects relating to the Appearance of any Licensed Mark and (ii) otherwise in all material respects, including with respect to the inclusion of all appropriate trademark notices, including the use of the designations (R) and sm, as applicable, with the Licensed Marks; provided, however, that solely to the extent that any Licensed Mark is used in a media that does not reasonably permit use in conformity with such Trademark Usage Guidelines (including by way of illustration and not of limitation, use of the Licensed Marks in EDGAR filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission), such use shall not be prohibited by this Section 3.4(a). (b) Subject to Section 3.4(a) above: (i) Licensee shall provide Licensor a draft of Licensee's first Identity Standards Manual that it proposes to include in a UFOC with respect to prospective Branded Franchisees, and which the parties acknowledge may be in a form comparable to the forms of the identity standards manuals that the Licensee Group uses in connection with its other franchisee systems, but must comply with the Trademark Usage Guidelines with respect to the Appearance of any Licensed Mark. Licensor shall review such draft Identity Standards Manual promptly upon receipt, and Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the final Identity Standards Manual included in such UFOC shall be subject to Licensor's prior approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. To the extent that the Identity Standards Manual approved by Licensor pursuant to the foregoing differs from the Trademark Usage Guidelines, Licensee shall have the 17
right to rely upon and comply with such Identity Standards Manual approved by Licensor as provided herein. (ii) The Identity Standards Manual approved by Licensor may be amended or supplemented in good faith by Licensee from time to time, provided that any such amendment or supplement complies with the Trademark Usage Guidelines with respect to the Appearance of any Licensed Mark and contains or proposes a change to the Identity Standards Manual that is of a quality equal to or higher, or as or more strict, than the Identity Standards Manual approved by Licensor pursuant to Section 3.4(b)(i). (c) The words contained in or comprising any Licensed Mark other than the word "Sotheby's" shall not be smaller in proportion to the word "Sotheby's" than the approximate proportion of the word "Sotheby's" with the words "International Realty" as such words appear together in the SIR Mark in the Trademark Usage Guidelines. (d) This Section 3.4 shall not be deemed to limit or modify any other provision of this Agreement, including with respect to any use of the Licensed Marks. Section 3.5. Promotional Materials. Subject to Section 3.4, Licensee and their permitted sublicensees shall be permitted to use the Licensed Marks in connection with internal promotional materials for the Authorized Services (examples include clothing, hats, writing implements, mugs and other similar customary marketing materials) that are (i) distributed free of charge to any existing or prospective customer of the Authorized Brokerage Services or distributed or sold to any sales associate or employee of any Branded Operator for subsequent distribution free of charge to any existing or prospective customer of the Authorized Brokerage Services, (ii) not sold or offered for sale to any person that is not a sales associate or employee of any Branded Operator and (iii) subject to the Trademark Usage Guidelines, the Model Provisions and other quality control provisions no less strict than those contained in the Licensee Group's franchise agreements for Authorized Brokerage Services as in effect on the Effective Date with respect to the use of marks on or in connection with marketing and promotional materials used by Franchisees. Section 3.6. Government Filings and Investor Relations. Subject to Section 3.4, Licensee and each Company Affiliate is permitted to use any Licensed Mark in or in connection with any filing with any Governmental Authority or stock exchange or any disclosure or materials provided to investors or prospective investors or financial analysts or any materials used for corporate or business matters (including presentation materials) used by Parent, in each case only to the extent that the use permitted by this Section 3.6 is incidental to the operation of the business of providing Authorized Brokerage Services under the Licensed Marks. Section 3.7. Branded Franchise Marketing (a) Licensee covenants and agrees that it shall, and it shall cause the applicable Company Affiliates, to spend all advertising charges and marketing payments received from any Branded Franchisees on advertising and marketing promoting the business of such Branded Franchisees. For purposes of the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that such spending of advertising charges and marketing fees is deemed to include spending of 18
such charges and fees for the Licensee Group's administrative and personnel costs associated with administering the marketing program of the Branded Franchisee franchise system. (b) Independent of, and without regard to, amounts collected by Licensee or any Company Affiliate from Branded Franchisees for advertising and marketing, Licensee covenants and agrees that it will spend $10,000,000 in cash in calendar year 2005, and that it is its intent to spend $10,000,000 and $5,000,000 in cash in calendar years 2006 and 2007, respectively, in connection with the marketing of the Branded Franchisee system. Section 3.8. Licensor's Publications. Licensor covenants and agrees that it will, or will cause the applicable Licensor Affiliates to, accept for publication in its proprietary Preview publication an advertisement from Licensee or from Company Affiliates for Authorized Brokerage Services under any Licensed Mark, which advertisements will be purchased and sold at the then-prevailing rates charged by Licensor to third-party advertisers. The form and presentation of such advertising shall be in Licensor's sole discretion, including with respect to matters of good taste and the appearance (including as to color, size and other matters) of the Licensed Marks. Section 3.9. Modification of Sotheby's Name. In the event that Licensor desires to modify the Sotheby's Mark or its stylized design with respect to Licensor's and its Affiliates businesses, Licensor shall provide Licensee with not less than six months' advance written notice of such change (the "New Style Notice") and the effective date of such change (the "New Style Date"), and on the New Style Date each Licensed Mark (including as it is sublicensed by Licensee hereunder) shall be automatically modified accordingly and Licensor's and its Affiliates use of the Sotheby's Mark shall also be modified accordingly; provided that modification of the Licensed Marks shall not be required to the extent that the name SOTHEBY'S is changed to include descriptive terms inconsistent with real estate brokerage services (e.g., "Sotheby's Auction Houses"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Licensor and its Affiliates discontinue all use of the Sotheby's Mark for a period of at least 12 consecutive months, then Licensee shall have the right to use the Sotheby's Mark to the extent embodied in each Licensed Mark during the term of this Agreement and pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. As of the New Style Date, all new advertising, marketing materials, signage and any other new representation of each Licensed Mark shall conform to the noticed modifications, provided that for a period of three years from the New Style Date, Licensee and each Branded Operator shall be permitted to use its inventory of marketing materials, signage and other similar materials to the extent in existence as of date of the New Style Notice. The right of Licensor to cause a change to any Licensed Mark pursuant to this Section 3.9 shall be exercisable not more than once in any five-year period during the term. Section 3.10. Advertising and Marketing Agents. The parties acknowledge and agree that Licensee's rights hereunder include the right to allow its agents and the agents of its permitted sublicensees to use the Licensed Marks in the ordinary course of business for the sole and limited purpose of creating and placing marketing and advertising on behalf of Licensee or such permitted sublicensee for the marketing and sale of Authorized Services, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 19

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Section 5.1, Owned Covered Revenue or Franchisee Covered Revenue "Earned by the Licensee Group from the performance of Authorized Brokerage Services" refers to the royalty fees payable to a member of the Licensee Group with respect to Authorized Brokerage Services by any Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office, as the case may be, not the underlying gross commission income (or other or equivalent revenue) itself of such Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office, as the case may be. (d) Examples of the basic calculation of the Fee payable to Licensor with respect to Covered Revenue from the performance of Authorized Brokerage Services under Section 5.1 are set forth immediately below, for purposes of illustration only: 21

(c) In the event that the Licensee Group shall be awarded any damages or shall be paid consideration in settlement of any claim of the Licensee Group, and all or any portion of such award or payment constitutes or is otherwise characterized as being a type of payment that would otherwise constitute Franchisee Covered Revenue (or which is in lieu of, or as compensation for, a payment that would constitute Franchisee Covered Revenue), including any award of damages in lieu of Franchisee royalties or future Franchisee royalties, such portion of such award or payment shall be treated as Franchisee Covered Revenue subject to Section 5.1.

Section 5.4. Late Payment. Any payments of Fees which are not paid by the date such payments are due and payable shall bear interest to the extent permitted by applicable Law at the Prime Rate on the date such payment is due, calculated based on the number of months (pro rated, as necessary) such payment is delinquent; provided that the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise modify any other remedies available to Licensor whether pursuant to this Agreement or at law or equity. Section 5.5. Method of Payment.

Licensee. Payments shall be net of any withholding taxes required by applicable Law. With respect to Fees calculated on Covered Revenue Earned outside the United States upon exercise of the Option, payments shall be calculated based on currency exchange rates for the calendar quarter for which remittance is made for Fees. For each month and each currency, such exchange rate shall equal the arithmetic average of the daily exchange rates (obtained as described below) during the Calendar Quarter; each daily exchange rate shall be obtained from the Reuters Daily Rate Report or, if not so available, from The Wall Street Journal, Eastern United States Edition, or, if not so available, as otherwise agreed by the parties.

(b) "Minimum Amount" shall mean $1,500,000, provided that such amount shall be increased as of December 31, 2010 and each December 31 of each subsequent year during the term of this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Percentage Increase of the then-applicable Minimum Amount; provided that such amount shall not exceed $2,000,000. The "Percentage Increase" shall be the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index -- All Urban Consumers (or if such ceases to be published, the most reasonably comparable index published by the United States government) increased by the end of the then applicable calendar year from the prior calendar year.

Any such referral by Licensor or any Licensor Affiliate shall be communicated to Licensee, or to such Company Affiliate as Licensee may from time to time designate to receive such referrals, by written notice to Licensor. An "Existing Brokerage Lead" shall mean a Person with whom a broker of a Branded Operator has an existing client 24
relationship providing Authorized Brokerage Services as of the time Licensor or any Licensor Affiliate made such referral. (b) Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 shall obligate Licensor or any Licensor Affiliate to make any referral or affirmatively promote the Authorized Brokerage Services of any Branded Operator. Section 6.2. Referrals by Licensee. (a) Licensor agrees to pay to Licensee a fee equal to 10% of the gross commission income earned by a Licensor Affiliate from the sale of any property at auction by Holdings, which property is referred to such Licensor Affiliate by Licensee or any Company Affiliate, provided that the property referred to auction by Licensee or a Company Affiliate, as applicable, is not the property of an Existing Auction Client; provided further, that no such fee shall be due to Licensee unless the gross sale price of such property, or such property together with other related properties referred to such Licensor Affiliate in accordance with this Section 6.2(a), is in excess of $100,000. An "Existing Auction Client" shall mean a Person with whom a Licensor Affiliate has an existing client relationship with respect to the purchase or sale of property at auction as of the time Licensee or any Company Affiliate made such referral. (b) Nothing contained herein shall obligate Licensee or any Company Affiliate to make any referral or affirmatively promote the Auction House Business of the Licensor Affiliates. Section 6.3. Payment of Referral Fees. Payments of any fees under this Article 6 shall be made within 30 days of the payment of the commission or other payment giving rise to a referral fee hereunder and such payment shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of such referral fee, including the amount of the applicable gross commission or other payment and the corresponding referral, and attaching any reasonably requested supporting documentation, which shall be treated confidentially. ARTICLE VII QUALITY CONTROL Section 7.1. Eligible Markets. (a) Licensee shall have the right to offer and sell the Authorized Services under the Licensed Marks, and to sublicense such right or grant a franchise to a Broker Affiliate, Franchisee or Company Affiliate, including for any Owned Office, in each case only for a geographic area qualifying as an Eligible Market; provided, that in the case of any exercise of the Option, the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any country in the Option Territory for which a license is granted pursuant to such Option exercise. (b) For purposes hereof, an "Eligible Market" shall mean a geographic area in which the median sales price ("MSP") for homes sold in such area during the most recent 12 full calendar months for which data is available immediately prior to (i) entering into a Branded Franchise Agreement with a proposed Branded Franchisee or (ii) branding the Authorized 25
Services of a Branded Owned Office with the Licensed Marks, as applicable (the "Measurement Period"), is at least 1.5 times the MSP for the United States during the Measurement Period. (c) The MSPs for the United States shall be determined by Licensee based on data to the extent available provided by a recognized independent publisher of home sale price information (e.g. the National Association of Realtors or Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)). The MSP for each Covered Geographic Area shall be determined by Licensee based upon data provided by the same source as Licensee used for the foregoing determination with respect to the United States to the extent such data is available from such source and, to the extent that such data is not available from such source, Licensee shall use data that is in Licensee's good faith business judgment the most comparable to the data used with respect to Licensee's determination of the MSP for the United States. (d) Before Licensee shall grant any franchise to a prospective Branded Franchisee, Licensee's franchise review committee shall, at a minimum, review and consider the following in determining whether to grant such franchise: (i) a full and complete franchise application from the prospective franchisee, (ii) to the extent available, relevant market data provided by an independent third party, (iii) to the extent available, relevant data provided by the Multiple Listing Service covering the applicable geographic area and (iv) an on site inspection report submitted by Licensee's representative. (e) Each (i) Sold Owned Office, (ii) Corcoran Legacy Office, (iii) Pre-Existing Broker Affiliate and (iv) Person that was a broker affiliate of SIR that was terminated by SIR other than for cause, or that exercised a right of termination, during the two years prior to the Effective Date (an "SIR Legacy Affiliate") is deemed to be in an Eligible Market and to satisfy the Guidelines described in Section 7.2 below solely with respect to the Covered Geographic Area in which it offered and sold Authorized Services as of the Effective Date (or in the case of an SIR Legacy Affiliate, as of the time of termination of its broker affiliate agreement with SIR); provided that any Branded Franchise to be granted to an SIR Legacy Affiliate or Pre-Existing Broker Affiliate shall not cover a Covered Geographic Area larger than the Covered Geographic Area provided in such prospective franchisee's broker affiliate agreement, as in effect as of the Effective Time or as in effect at the time of such termination, as applicable, with SIR, including as modified by any oral agreement or authorized course of dealing. Section 7.2. Sublicensee Eligibility Guidelines. (a) In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 7.1, (x) prior to granting any franchise to any prospective Branded Franchisee, (y) prior to executing any Broker Affiliate Agreement with any prospective Branded Broker Affiliate and (z) prior to any Owned Office being branded with any Licensed Mark (including pursuant to any sublicense), Licensee, in determining whether to make such grant or effect such branding, shall take into account the guidelines set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) below (the "Guidelines"). Determinations as to whether the Guidelines have been satisfied shall be made by Licensee, in their good faith business judgment, based on such available data as Licensee reasonably deems appropriate. The Guidelines apply to offices of Branded Franchisees, Branded Broker Affiliates and Branded Owned Offices on a company-by-company basis rather than on an office-by-office basis, so that multiple offices operated by a single Person are tested as a whole. Once a Branded Franchisee, 26
Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office has satisfied the Guidelines it shall be deemed to have satisfied the Guidelines for the term of the License Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the Owned Offices of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and the Pre-Existing Broker Affiliates satisfy the Guidelines for the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any exercise of the Option, the Guidelines shall not apply to any prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate and Branded Owned Office located outside of the United States, which Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate and Branded Owned Office shall be chosen in Licensee's sole discretion, provided that, with respect to any Branded Franchisee located outside of the United States, Licensee grants the Branded Franchises pursuant to a master franchisee agreement with a master franchisor the material terms of which master franchise agreement have been presented to Licensor, and such materials terms and such master franchisor are acceptable to Licensor as indicated by it in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). A prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office shall satisfy the Guidelines if: (i) it satisfies any one of the following guidelines for the geographic area (as determined by Licensee) to be covered (the "Covered Geographic Area") by the prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office: (A) the average selling price ("ASP") for homes sold or purchased by the customers of such prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office in transactions brokered by such prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office in the Covered Geographic Area during the Measurement Period is in the top 40% of selling prices for all homes sold in the Covered Geographic Area; or (B) during the Measurement Period, such prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office ranked in the top 40% in terms of home purchases or sales brokered in the Covered Geographic Area based on the aggregate sales price of residential real estate transactions actually closed (the "Transaction Value"); or (C) such prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office is ranked first, second or third in the Covered Geographic Area in terms of (1) highest ASP for homes sold or purchased during the Measurement Period in the Covered Geographic Area or (2) highest Transaction Value for homes sold or purchased in the Covered Geographic Area during the Measurement Period; or (D) such prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office owns or operates a newly formed residential brokerage office, which office is or will be composed of agents substantially all of whom, immediately prior to the time the office would become a Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office, were affiliated with a licensed broker that would have satisfied the guidelines in one of clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this Section 7.2(a)(i) with respect to the Measurement Period; or 27
(ii) it does not satisfy any of the guidelines set forth in Section 7.2(a)(i) but such prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office, together with all Franchisees that became Branded Franchisees, all Broker Affiliates that became Branded Broker Affiliates and all Owned Offices that became Branded Owned Offices during the immediately preceding Measurement Period and who became eligible pursuant this clause (ii) (and not pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)), would not represent more than 10% of the total number of all prospective Branded Franchisees, Branded Broker Affiliates or Branded Owned Offices, taken together, that became Branded Franchisees, Branded Broker Affiliates or Branded Owned Offices, respectively, during the Measurement Period. (b) With respect to the renewal by Licensee or its sublicensee of any Branded Franchise Agreement with a then-existing Branded Franchisee or any Broker Affiliate Agreement with a then-existing Branded Broker Affiliate, in each case during the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use reasonable efforts to apply the Guidelines; provided, however, that any renewals of such existing Branded Franchisee or Branded Broker Affiliate shall be at Licensee's sole discretion; and provided further, that in the event a then existing Branded Franchisee or Branded Broker Affiliate (other than a Pre-Existing Broker Affiliate) was granted a franchise pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(ii), the renewal of any such Branded Franchisee or Branded Broker Affiliate shall be subject to the satisfaction of the Guidelines pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 7.2, including Section 7.2(a)(ii). (c) If the Covered Geographic Area covered by the Branded Franchisee changes to include new offices of such Branded Franchisee located outside of the Eligible Market, then Licensee shall be permitted to expand the Covered Geographic Area to include such new offices if such expanded Covered Geographic Area satisfies the requirements of an Eligible Market at the time of such expansion. (d) Licensee shall provide to Licensor, on a quarterly basis, a report containing (i) the number of Branded Franchises granted and the number of sublicenses granted to Branded Owned Offices and Branded Broker Affiliates during the prior quarter and the corresponding Covered Geographic Area and (ii) brief general descriptive information with respect to the business of each such new Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate and Branded Owned Office and (iii) such other information as Licensor reasonably requests. Semiannually for the first three years of the term of this Agreement, and thereafter on an annual basis, at Licensor's option, the parties shall meet in person to discuss the general process by which Licensee determines prospective Branded Franchisee, Branded Broker Affiliate or Branded Owned Office eligibility and related matters.

Section 13.2. Indemnification by Licensor. Licensor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensee and the Company Affiliates, the representatives and agents thereof, and each of the successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any Broker Affiliate or Franchisee or any other sublicensee of Licensee other than a Company Affiliate) (collectively, the "Licensee Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Damages suffered by any of the Licensee Indemnified Parties resulting from, arising out of, relating to or incurred with respect to (without duplication of any amounts paid pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Purchase Agreement): (i) any breach by Licensor of this Agreement (including in respect of any representation or warranty of Licensor as of the Effective Date, or with respect to the exercise of the Option with respect to any Option Territory, as of the date of license to the extent applicable); (ii) any third-party claim, suit, demand, investigation, proceeding, arbitration or litigation against any Licensee Indemnified Party that the use of any Registered Mark for the Applicable Registered Services in the Applicable Registered Country violates or infringes the trademark, copyright, right of publicity or privacy or other intellectual property rights of such third party except to the extent resulting from, arising out of, relating to or incurred with respect to (x) any use of any Licensed Mark by any Person in breach of this Agreement or any sublicense, (y) any combination of any Licensed Mark with any other Mark or (z) the provision of any service or product other than the Applicable Registered Services in the Applicable Registered Country under the Registered Mark corresponding thereto; and (iii) any claim, suit, demand, investigation, proceeding, arbitration or litigation by a third party against any Licensee Indemnified Party resulting from, arising out of, relating to or incurred with respect to the business, operations, conduct, acts or omissions of Licensor, any Licensor Affiliate or any of their agents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, franchisees or sublicensees conducting business under the Sotheby's Mark in connection with any service other than the Authorized Services (which shall not include the business, operations, conduct, acts or omissions of any Licensee Indemnified Party or any direct or indirect sublicensee, franchisee, Affiliate or agent of Licensee), and any matter relating thereto, including (x) any failure of any such Person to comply with any applicable Law and (y) acts or omissions of any such Person constituting fraud, tortious conduct, unfair trade practices, negligence or willful misconduct, or resulting in damage or destruction of property, injury, death, loss or other damages of any kind, except with respect to all of the foregoing for those Damages for which Licensee has an obligation to indemnify a Licensor Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms of clause (i) of Section 13.1 (without giving effect to Section 13.3).

Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding: (a) in no event shall Licensee be liable for, or required to make any payment pursuant to, clause (i) of Section 13.1, with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent and Licensee (other than with respect to any breach or inaccuracy in any of 46
the representations and warranties of Parent and Licensee set forth in Section 8.2(a) which shall not be subject to the Licensee Deductible Amount), for any indemnifiable Damages suffered by the Licensor Indemnified Parties unless and until the aggregate dollar amount of all such Damages, taken together with the aggregate dollar amount of all indemnifiable Damages suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement) under clause (i) of Section 7.2 of the Purchase Agreement exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Licensee Deductible Amount"), and then only to the extent of such excess, provided that Damages indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by the Licensor Indemnified Parties with respect to breaches or inaccuracies in the representations or warranties set forth in Section 8.2(a), and Damages indemnified under the Purchase Agreement in respect of claims made by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) with respect to breaches or inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of Sellers (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.6 and 4.7 of the Purchase Agreement, shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the aggregate Damages exceed the Licensee Deductible Amount as described above; (b) in no event shall Licensor be liable for, or required to make any payment pursuant to, clause (i) of Section 13.2, with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty of Licensor (other than with respect to any breach or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of Licensor set forth in Section 8.1(a)) which shall not be subject to the Licensor Deductible Amount), for any indemnifiable Damages suffered by the Licensee Indemnified Parties unless and until the aggregate dollar amount of all such Damages, taken together with the aggregate dollar amount of all indemnifiable Damages suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement) under clause (i) of Section 7.3 of the Purchase Agreement exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Licensor Deductible Amount"), and then only to the extent of such excess, provided that Damages indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by the Licensee Indemnified Parties with respect to breaches or inaccuracies in the representations or warranties set forth in Section 8.1(a), and Damages indemnified under the Purchase Agreement in respect of claims made by the Seller Indemnified Parties (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) with respect to breaches or inaccuracies in the representations or warranties set forth in Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.10(c), 3.19, 3.21 and 3.22 of the Purchase Agreement, shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the aggregate Damages exceed the Licensor Deductible Amount as described above; (c) in no event shall Licensor or Licensee be liable for, or required to make any payment pursuant to, Sections 13.1 or 13.2 (i) to the extent arising out of any indemnifiable matter unless a claim therefor is asserted specifying in good faith, in reasonable detail and in writing by the applicable Licensor Indemnified Party or Licensee Indemnified Party, as the case may be, within the time period that such indemnifiable matter survives in accordance with Section 13.4, failing which such claim shall be waived and extinguished, (ii) to the extent arising out of any legislation not in force as of the Effective Date or any change of Law or administrative practice, which takes effect retroactively to periods prior to the Effective Date, (iii) which are merely estimates of Damages and not actual Damages or (iv) to the extent that the indemnifiable Damages have been incurred as a result of any failure by the Licensor Indemnified Party or Licensee Indemnified Party, as the case may be, to mitigate such Damages as required by applicable law; and 47
(d) in no event shall Licensor or Licensee be liable for any damages of the type described in Section 16.2. Section 13.4. Survival of Representations and Warranties. Each of the representations and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement shall terminate on March 31, 2006; provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties contained in Sections 8.1(a) and (d) and Section 8.2(a) shall remain in full force and effect without termination. In the event notice of any claim for indemnification under Sections 13.1(i) or 13.2(i) of this Agreement shall have been given (within the meaning of Section 13.5) within the applicable survival period, the representations and warranties that are the subject of such indemnification claim shall survive with respect to such claims until such time as such claim is finally resolved. Section 13.5. Notice and Resolution of Claim. (a) The Licensor Indemnified Parties or the Licensee Indemnified Parties to be indemnified hereunder (each, an "Indemnified Party"), as the case may be, shall promptly give written notice to the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") after obtaining knowledge of any third party claim against the Indemnified Party as to which recovery may be sought against the Indemnifying Party because of the indemnities set forth in Sections 13.1 or 13.2, specifying in good faith and in reasonable detail the third party claim including, to the extent reasonably practicable, an estimate of Damages claimed, and the basis for indemnification; provided, that the failure of an Indemnified Party promptly to notify the Indemnifying Party of any such matter shall not release the Indemnifying Party, in whole or in part, from its obligations under this Article 13 except to the extent the Indemnified Party's failure to so notify in breach of this Section 13.5 actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any such third party claim at its own cost and expense with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (as to which the Indemnified Party has not promptly and reasonably objected) by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party of its intention to assume such defense within the lesser of (i) thirty (30) days after notice thereof has been given to the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) five (5) Business Days prior to the date required to answer or respond to any such claim (the "Election Period"). Commencing on the beginning of and during the Election Period, the Indemnified Party agrees to make available to the Indemnifying Party and its authorized representatives the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the third party claim, as well as any other information bearing thereon reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of any such third party claim within the Election Period, then the Indemnified Party shall defend or settle such third party claim in a diligent and commercially reasonable manner and in good faith and may settle such third party claim on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate; provided, however, that such Indemnified Party shall not, in defense of such a third party claim, be permitted to admit any liability with respect to, or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, any such third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any liability for any such admission, settlement, compromise, discharge or consent to judgment made by an Indemnified Party without such prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) any defense assumed by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 13.5(a), and an Indemnifying Party will bear its own 48
costs and expenses with respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such third party claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Party shall pay all fees and expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party prior to such Indemnifying Party's assumption of such defense. (b) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such third party claim, the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this Article 13 shall include taking all steps deemed necessary by the Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, in the investigation, defense or settlement of such third party claim (including the retention of legal counsel) and the Indemnifying Party shall, as a condition to assuming such defense, acknowledge that it will hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and all Damages caused by or arising out of any settlement approved by the Indemnifying Party or any judgment in such claim (subject to the applicable deductibles and limitations set forth in Section 13.4). The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party as to the existence of any offers to settle such third party claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall not settle a third party claim if to the knowledge of the Indemnifying Party (after notifying and consulting with the Indemnified Party) such action would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse impact on the Indemnified Party; otherwise the Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and settlement, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that such Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in (but not control) such defense or settlement through separate counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party, with the fees and expenses of such participation and separate counsel borne solely by such Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, in the defense of a third party claim, make any payment of any of such claims, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or proposed settlement (i) involves only the payment of money damages and does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of law, (ii) includes, as an unconditional term thereof, a release of such Indemnified Party given by the claimant or the plaintiff from any liabilities arising from such third party claim, and (iii) does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief, directly or indirectly, upon such Indemnified Party or result in an admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. (c) Indemnified Parties and Indemnifying Parties shall cooperate reasonably in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial compromise, settlement or discharge of any third party claim, including, without limitation, by providing the other party with reasonable access to employees, directors and officers (as witnesses) and other information. (d) All indemnity payments owed under this Article 13 ("Indemnity Payments"), shall be paid in immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after final determination (which is final in the sense that it is no longer subject to appeal) and written request therefor by the Indemnified Party. All such Indemnity Payments shall be made to the accounts and in the manner specified in writing by the party entitled to such Indemnity 49
Payments. Any amounts that are not paid within such ten day period shall accrue interest at the Prime Rate on the date such payment is due. (e) In the event of any conflict between Section 12.5 and this Article 13, Article 13 shall govern. ARTICLE XIV DEFAULT AND TERMINATION Section 14.1. Termination.

Licensee, on the one hand, and Licensor, on the other, shall establish a committee (the "Review Committee") for the purpose of discussing the parties' respective businesses conducted in connection with this Agreement, those certain other matters contemplated hereby, including as set forth in Section 15.2, and such other matters relating to this Agreement, including disputes hereunder, as the parties may desire to raise with one another. Licensee and Licensor shall have the right to appoint an equal number of representatives to the Review Committee, which shall not exceed two representatives, respectively, unless the parties agree otherwise. The parties' representatives to the Review Committee shall be officers who (a) have responsibility for, and familiarity with, in the case of Licensee, Licensee's business and operations under the Licensed Marks and, in the case of Licensor, Licensor and the Licensor Affiliates' business as it relates to matters contemplated by this Agreement and (b) the requisite 52

Responsibilities. The Review Committee shall meet once approximately every six months until December 31, 2006, and annually thereafter during the term of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with and in view of the long-term nature of the License Agreement and changes which may occur in Law or in the marketplace in the future, in the event that either party proposes amendments in good faith to this Agreement to address any such change to the extent the change would or does result in a material diminishment of the benefits of this Agreement from those that would have been realized by such party without such change, the Review Committee shall discuss and consider such changes and proposed amendments in good faith and the Review Committee shall serve as a non-exclusive forum in which the parties shall negotiate in good faith regarding any such proposed changes; provided that no party hereto shall be obligated to agree to any change to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 15.2 shall modify or limit the terms and conditions of Section 20.3. The Review Committee shall also discuss ways in which each party may benefit from the client base of the other party in marketing or cross-marketing their respective services. The Review Committee shall establish its own procedures with respect to the conduct of its meetings, provided that Licensee, on the one hand, and Licensor, on the other, shall propose any matters for the agenda of each meeting of the Review Committee reasonably in advance by notice to the members of the Review Committee. The parties shall in good faith coordinate with one another to establish the schedule of meetings for the Review Committee as contemplated by this Section 15.2. Section 15.3. Liaisons. In supplement to, and without limiting the scope and purposes of, the Review Committee, the parties desire that Licensor and Licensee each designate an officer thereof to act as a liaison to the other parties for purposes of facilitating communications by and among the parties in connection with matters relating to this Agreement and addressing business issues and disputes between the parties and issues involving mutual clients that may arise during the term. Licensor and Licensee covenant and agree that its liaison under this Section 15.3 shall have the requisite authority to address the issues and disputes that may be communicated to such liaison, including direct access to senior-level management of Licensee and Licensor, as applicable, as necessary. Licensor and Licensee shall each designate their respective liaisons under this Section 15.3 by written notice to the other parties, which notice shall include the relevant contact information for such liaison. Licensor and Licensee shall have the right to replace its liaison from time to time and designate a replacement liaison who meets the criteria for a liaison contemplated by this Section 5.13, upon notice to the other parties. Licensor shall and shall cause each Licensor Affiliate and the Licensor Liaison, and Licensee shall and shall cause each Company Affiliate and the Licensee Liaison, to cooperate with one another to ensure that they each respond to any matter raised by another party hereunder, including by its liaison, with due regard for the magnitude and time requirements of such matter and, with respect to matters relating to any mutual client regarded by Licensor or Licensee as a very important client, on an extremely expedited basis. 53
Section 15.4. Winding Down. This Article 15 shall survive termination of this Agreement, for the purpose of monitoring, and otherwise coordinating with respect to, the matters contemplated in Section 14.2, and shall thereafter terminate when the obligations of the parties under Section 14.2 have been fulfilled. Section 15.5. Non-Exclusive Role. Nothing in this Article 15, including the formation of the Review Committee, its purposes or the designation of the liaisons hereunder, shall in any way limit or modify Section 16.1. ARTICLE XVI CERTAIN REMEDIES Section 16.1. Specific Performance. (a) The parties agree that if any of the material provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. (b) With respect to any material breach or default under this Agreement by Licensee and without limiting in any way the obligation of Licensor to establish such breach, Licensee hereby waives any defense to (other than as to Licensor's ability to establish its likelihood of success on the merits), and to that extent consents to, the order of specific performance and the entry of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Licensee barring such nonperformance or breach and imposing reasonable measures to prevent further nonperformance or breach. (c) This Section 16.1 shall not in any way limit any remedy that any party may have at law or in equity, and no party shall be required to pursue its rights under this Section 16.1 prior to pursuit of any other remedy at law or in equity. The remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive. Section 16.2. Limitation of Remedies. None of the parties hereto shall be liable to any other party for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, or for lost profits, unrealized expectations or other similar terms, claimed by such other party resulting from such first party's breach of its obligations, agreements, representations or warranties hereunder, provided that nothing in this Section 16.2 shall preclude any recovery by a party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article XIII for such Damages payable to any third party as a result of a third party claim.

ARTICLE XVIII OPTION RELATING TO FOREIGN TRADEMARKS Section 18.1. Grant of Option. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the five-year period commencing on the Effective Date (the "Option Period"), Licensee shall have the option (the "Option") to (i) license the Licensed Marks for use solely for the offer and sale of Authorized Services, on the terms provided herein, in the Option Territory and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law and Licensor's obligations under applicable agreements of Licensor and the Licensor Affiliates, acquire (a "Foreign Operations Sale") on an "as is, where is" basis and without warranties, either Licensor's brokerage operations (to the extent not then shut down) in the Option Territory or the franchise and affiliation agreements, if any, to which Licensor is a party at the time of such exercise of the Option. Section 18.2. Maintenance of Registration; Limitation. (a) Licensor shall have no obligation to maintain (i) its business operations relating to any Licensed Mark in any country in the Option Territory or (ii) its use of any Licensed Mark in any country in the Option Territory except with respect to the filings contemplated under Section 18.2(b).

(c) Following any exercise of the Option, Licensor and Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (at Licensee's expense) any consents, authorizations, approvals, permits or licenses and submission of all filings, declarations, registrations or notices as are necessary or advisable under applicable Law, including antitrust Laws ("Option Consents and Filings"). With respect to any exercise of the Option with respect to Germany, the approval of the German Federal Cartel Office or the confirmation by the German Federal Cartel Office that no filing is required shall be among the Option Consents and Filings. (d) Following any exercise of the Option, Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file (at Licensee's expense) a trademark registration application with respect to the Licensed Marks in each country with respect to which the Option is being exercised, to the extent not already registered (including at Licensee's request prior to such time). The procedures for preparing, filing and prosecuting each such trademark registration application shall be those applicable to the registration of Licensed Marks in the Option Territory. Licensor will establish (at Licensee's expense) an Eligible SPV in (i) the United States, (ii) in the country with respect to which the Option has been exercised (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), (iii) the country in which the Licensed Marks with respect to which the Option is being exercised are held at the time of exercise or (iv) such other jurisdiction as Licensor reasonably determines, and shall file such trademark registration application in the name of such Eligible SPV (after effecting any necessary transfers of rights to such Eligible SPV). (e) Following (x) the receipt by Licensor of a certificate of registration from the applicable Governmental Authority with respect to each such trademark registration application and (y) the receipt or submission of any Option Consents and Filings as are necessary or advisable under applicable Law, the parties will in good faith prepare and enter into an addendum or joinder agreement to this Agreement: (i) reflecting the application of the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the use of the Licensed Marks in the country or countries with respect to which the Option is being exercised, including with respect to quality control matters and the representations and warranties of each of the parties with respect to the Licensed Marks as of the date of the entering into of such addendum or joinder agreement, and the survival of such representations and warranties for a period of two years thereafter; (ii) amending Schedule C to reflect as part of the Territory under this Agreement the addition of such country with respect to which the Option has been exercised; (iii) providing that Fees shall accrue with respect to Covered Revenue Earned from Authorized Brokerage Services in such country or countries, as provided herein; (iv) containing such other modification to the terms of this Agreement and additional terms and conditions as may be reasonably necessary to comport with the 57
applicable Law of the country or countries with respect to which the Option is being exercised, to permit Licensor and its Affiliates to comply with any remaining contractual obligations of Licensor and the Licensor Affiliates with respect to the Licensed Marks in such country or countries (including any then-existing broker affiliate agreements) and to accomplish the purposes of this Article 18 and the intentions of the parties without affecting the financial and legal substance of the matters contemplated by this Agreement in a way that is materially adverse to any party; and (v) otherwise evidencing the agreement of such Eligible SPV to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a Licensor hereunder, subject to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), including with respect to modifications and additions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. (f) In the event that Licensee exercises the Option with respect to any Foreign Operations Sale, following the receipt by Licensor of any Option Consents and Filings as are necessary or advisable under applicable Law with respect to such Foreign Operations Sale, the parties will in good faith prepare and enter into a separate agreement effecting such Foreign Operations Sale on an "as is, where is" basis and without warranties, and as otherwise contemplated by this Section 18.3; provided that any Foreign Operations Sale shall be conditioned upon the simultaneous or prior grant of the license for the Licensed Marks (pursuant to Section 18.3(e)) in the country in which the assets covered by such Foreign Operations Sale are located. Section 18.4. Covenant of Licensor Following Exercise. Following each exercise of the Option, Licensor shall (unless otherwise agreed by Licensor and Licensee), wind-up as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 180 days) all residential real-estate brokerage operations in the country with respect to which the Option is being exercised, including termination of then-existing broker affiliate agreements and franchise agreements to the extent not being assigned to Licensee pursuant to a separate agreement, with respect to such country, subject to the requirements of applicable Law in such country and the contractual and legal obligations of Licensor and the Licensor Affiliates in such country. Section 18.5. Negative Covenants of Licensor With Respect to Option Territory. During the term of this Agreement, Holdings and Licensor shall not, and Holdings shall cause the Licensor Affiliates (for so long as they remain Licensor Affiliates) not to, without the consent of Licensee, (a) enter into any new master franchise agreement or affiliation agreement with respect to the use of (i) any Licensed Mark or (ii) the Sotheby's Mark for the offer and sale of Authorized Services in any country in the Option Territory, other than Timeshare Brokerage Services and sales of Artistically Significant Residences in auction format and (b) sell, dispose or otherwise transfer to any Person, other than to an Eligible SPV, or grant a license to any Person to use, (x) any Licensed Mark or (y) the Sotheby's Mark for the offer and sale of Authorized Services, in any country in the Option Territory, other than Timeshare Brokerage Services and sales of Artistically Significant Residences in auction format. Section 18.6. Ownership of Marks. Licensee acknowledges that the direct ownership of any Licensed Mark with respect to any country in the Option Territory may be held by a Licensor Affiliate. In the event that Licensee shall exercise the Option with respect to a country 58
in the Option Territory for which the Licensed Marks are held by a Licensor Affiliate, Licensor shall cause such Licensor Affiliate to execute the respective addendum and/or joinder agreement for the purpose of effecting the grant of the license of the Licensed Marks as contemplated herein.

EXHIBIT 99.1 News Release - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINAL Diana Phillips Matthew Weigman Press Department (212) 606-7176 Jennifer Park Investor Relations (212) 894-1023 SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES 2003 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS o Fourth Quarter Revenues from Continuing Operations Increased 17% to $136.9 million from $116.9 million o Highest Fourth Quarter Results since Recent Peak of Art Market in 1999 o Strong First Quarter 2004 Underway March 11, 2004 New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID; LSE: STBA), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction businesses and art-related financing activities today announced results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003. For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported total revenues from continuing operations of $136.9 million, compared to $116.9 million in the corresponding period in 2002 for an increase of $20.0 million, or 17%, due to a very strong fall selling season. The Company's net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $17.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2002 of ($7.2) million, or ($0.12) per diluted share, partially due to the substantial reduction in employee retention costs and antitrust related special charges over the period. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $0.9 million, primarily due to antitrust related special charges. During
the same period of 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $29.6 million, or ($0.34) per diluted share, related to antitrust related special charges ($21.9 million), employee retention costs ($4.3 million) and net restructuring charges ($3.5 million). Excluding these items, the Company would have recorded adjusted net income from continuing operations of $18.1* million, or $0.29* per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003, as compared to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $13.6* million, or $0.22* per diluted share, in the same period in 2002, an increase of 33%. "We are delighted with our fourth quarter results, which are the best since 1999 and are up significantly compared to last year in adjusted operating income (up 52%)* and net income (up 33%)* (both from continuing operations). Sotheby's today enjoys the very best expertise, creativity and professionalism in the art world, which will be reflected in our results, both in the first quarter and we expect into the second quarter of 2004 as well," said William F. Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported total revenues from continuing operations of $319.6 million, compared to $310.5 million for the previous year, an improvement of $9.1 million or 3%. Net loss from continuing operations for the full year 2003 was ($26.5) million, or ($0.43) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($59.5) million, or ($0.97) per diluted share for 2002, primarily due to the significant reduction in employee retention costs and antitrust related special charges. 2003 results include pre-tax charges of $16.6 million, or ($0.19) per diluted share, which consist of employee retention costs of $8.5 million, net restructuring charges of $5.0 million and antitrust related special charges of $3.1 million. Excluding these charges, the Company's adjusted net loss from continuing operations for the full year 2003 would have been ($14.8)* million or ($0.24)* per diluted share. Included in the full year 2002 results are pre-tax charges of $65.6 million, which consist of antitrust related special charges of $41.0 million, employee retention costs of $22.6 million and net restructuring charges of $2.0 million. Excluding these pre-tax charges, adjusted net loss from continuing operations for the full year 2002 would have been ($8.9)* million, or ($0.14)* per diluted share. * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B. Note: As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the domestic operations of Sotheby's International Realty are classified as "Discontinued Operations". As a result, prior period results have been reclassified to present the results of such operations as discontinued operations. 2
Aggregate Auction Sales (hammer price plus buyer's premium) rose 15% in the fourth quarter of 2003 to $792.9 million, and was $1.69 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 5% decline compared to prior year. Mr. Ruprecht noted, however, that Sotheby's continued focus is on profitability and not sales or any market share level, particularly at the low end of the market. Discontinued Real Estate Operations As announced last month, Cendant Corporation, which is primarily a provider of travel and residential real estate services, acquired the domestic brokerage operations of Sotheby's International Realty and also entered into a license agreement of up to 100 years where Cendant licenses the Sotheby's International Realty brand in exchange for an ongoing licensing fee to Sotheby's. The total cash purchase price paid by Cendant for the company-owned real estate brokerage operations as well as the license agreement was approximately $100 million. "We are extremely happy with the outcome of this transaction for Sotheby's and its shareholders and with our long term strategic alliance with this outstanding partner, which we expect will extend and grow our world-renowned brand," commented Mr. Ruprecht. Long Term Refinancing On March 4th, Sotheby's entered into a new three year senior secured credit agreement with GE Commercial Finance Corporate Lending providing for borrowings of up to $200 million, of which $100 million is currently committed and the remainder is in the process of being offered to an international syndicate of lenders. Because of decreased liquidity needs as a result of the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Company's domestic real estate brokerage business described above, the Company may ultimately decide to limit the aggregate amount committed for borrowings under the GE Commercial Finance Credit Agreement to an amount that is less than $200 million. "This new credit agreement dramatically expands our financing capabilities and is indicative of the growing strength and momentum of our organization," commented Mr. Ruprecht. * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B. 3
Option Exchange Program On March 1st, Sotheby's launched an option exchange offer to employees holding certain underwater stock options to exchange those options for either cash or restricted stock, depending on the size of the employee's holding. If all eligible participants accept the offer, the cost of the program in 2004 will be approximately $8 million, of which approximately $2 million will be a cash expense, and the overhang of all current outstanding stock options (vested and unvested, at all exercise prices) as a proportion of common shares outstanding will be reduced from approximately 22% to approximately 13%. "We view this program to be of great value to those employees who hold underwater stock options which have failed to deliver value as well as to our shareholders with the reduction in overhang," commented Mr. Ruprecht. Year to Date 2004 Sales "We are very pleased with our sale results for the year so far, highlighted by the exceptional private sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberge" said Mr. Ruprecht. Last month, Sotheby's sold the Forbes Collection, which included nine fabled Imperial Easter Eggs and other objects that had a low pre-sale auction estimate in excess of $90 million, to Mr. Victor Vekselberg, a Russian industrialist, for an undisclosed sum. "We were very excited at the prospect of an extraordinary auction and magnificent pre-sale exhibition, but we knew that this remarkable offer and the return of the Faberge Imperial Easter Eggs to Russia had to be taken very seriously. We, along with the Forbes family, are delighted with the outcome," continued Mr. Ruprecht. In January, Sotheby's had a strong Americana week with a sales total of $13.6 million, soundly above its high estimate of $12.4 million. Our Old Masters Paintings sale in New York performed extremely well, leading the market with a total of $31.2 million, well within its pre-sale low and high estimates of $25.6 million and $36.3 million, respectively. The highlight of the sale was Hendrick Avercamp's A Winter Scene which garnered $8.7 million, well above its $4/$6 million presale estimate, and a record for the artist at auction. * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B. 4
Our February London sales also brought strong results. The Impressionist, Modern, German and Surrealist Art sales in London achieved approximately $75.4 million ('L'41.2 million) and was highlighted by eight lots selling over 'L'1 million and the sale of Edgar Degas' sculpture Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans for $9.2 million ('L'5.0 million) which was the highest price achieved in the London sales of Impressionist and Modern Art that week. In the Contemporary Art sales, Sotheby's led the competition by 70% with an exceptional two days of sales totaling $35.1 million, well above its pre-sale estimate of $22.9/$30.6 million. The evening sale of Contemporary Art (total of $27.0 million) acquired the record of being the highest total ever for a Contemporary sale in Europe, and was 93% sold. Second Quarter Sales Looking ahead to the second quarter, on May 5th in New York, Sotheby's is holding a remarkable single owner sale of 44 paintings belonging to the Greentree Foundation from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney which is expected to achieve in excess of $140 million. The centerpiece of this sale is Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe (Boy with a Pipe), which is considered to be one of the most beautiful and powerful pictures from the artist's "Rose Period" and was painted when he was only 24 years old. The picture is expected to garner in excess of $70 million. Other exceptional highlights of the sale are works by Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Sir Alfred J. Munnings and John Singer Sargent. In London, the renowned library formed by the first and second earls of Macclesfield before 1750 will be sold in a series of sales beginning in March 2004 and are expected to achieve $18 million ('L'10 million) in aggregate. In April and November 2004, Sotheby's New York will offer for sale an extraordinary collection of over 800 books and letters from the Collection of Maurice F. Neville, the finest collection of Modern Literature to appear on the market in over twenty five years. It includes a remarkable array of inscribed first editions, letters and manuscripts of such authors as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dylan Thomas, Jack Kerouac and arguably, the best collection of Ernest Hemingway material in private hands, as well as an extensive selection of detective literature * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B. 5 STATEMENT OF DIFFERENCES The British pound sterling sign shall be expressed as.................... 'L'
and mystery writers, including inscribed books, letters and manuscripts of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Dashiell Hammet, Raymond Chandler and Ian Fleming, among others. The collection is estimated to bring between $5/$7 million. Through the end of April, Sotheby's will be offering for Private Sale eleven works of art in an unprecedented exhibition at the exclusive Isleworth Country Club in Widermere, Florida entitled, "Monumental Masterpieces of Modern Sculpture." This $20 million private offering features some of the best sculpture cast in the 20th century by artists including August Rodin, Jean DuBuffet, Fernando Botero, Henry Moore, Joan Miro and Salvador Dali. On June 10 and 11, in New York, Sotheby's will auction Property from the Estate of Katharine Hepburn. The sale is expected to fetch approximately $1 million and comprises furniture, paintings and decorations from her homes, a selection of the clothing and accessories that epitomized her iconic sense of style, photographs and personal items as well as her own paintings and sketches. At the end of June, in Paris, Sotheby's will offer for sale 18th Century Furniture and Works of Art, Old Master and Impressionist/Modern Paintings, Silver and Vertu from The Franco Cesari Collection. This sale is estimated to bring (euro)7/(euro)10 million and is the first sale at Sotheby's Paris to include Impressionist and Modern Art. Highlights of the collection include works by Gustave Caillebotte and Camille Pissarro. About Sotheby's Holdings, Inc.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Annual Shareholder Meeting Speech [Michael Sovern] 2004 has begun with a series of remarkable events here at Sotheby's. What a difference a few years make. With our antitrust problems receding into history, costs under tight control and our best fourth and first quarter results since 1999, we are looking forward to a significantly better 2004. Consider these accomplishments: o Though 2003 got off to a bad start - the Iraqi war and worldwide economic uncertainties caused discretionary sellers to postpone their selling and buyers to take a more cautious approach to collecting - with the early success in the war and a strengthening of the economy, confidence improved, as did the quality of consignments around the world. This translated into an amazingly strong selling season and an excellent fourth quarter with a 17% increase in revenues, 52%* increase in operating income and 33%* increase in net income, as compared to the prior year. All of those figures are from continuing operations and exclude employee retention costs, net restructuring charges and special charges. o It bears repeating: results for the first quarter were our best since 1999. This is largely due to the landmark sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberge to Russian industrialist Victor Vekselberg for an amount we agreed not to disclose. The fabled nine Imperial Easter Eggs and the other objects in the collection were estimated in excess of $90 million and represent a wealth of Russian culture that can now be returned to its people. o In February, we sold Sotheby's International Realty to Cendant Corporation for approximately $100 million, a move designed to maximize value to our shareholders. The sale included a feature that should extend the reach of our brand and provide a * Non-GAAP measure. See Appendix A.
continuing revenue stream - a 100-year license permitting Cendant, under specified conditions, to use the Sotheby's International Realty brand. o Also in February, we closed a new three-year senior secured revolving credit agreement of $200 million, which dramatically expands our financing capabilities and the flexibility of this organization as a whole. o And then there was this week. The Whitney sale Wednesday evening shattered a number of records, achieving the highest price ever paid for a painting - $104.2 million for Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe. And yesterday's Impressionist sales brought outstanding results as well, bringing the two- day total to a staggering $314.9 million in sales. o These successes have not distracted us from our continuing focus on cost containment. Since 2000, we have decreased our expenses by over $70* million and since 1999 we have reduced headcount by 30%, excluding discontinued Realty operations. Management continues to assign a top priority to sensible reduction of our cost structure. That is the key to lowering the Company's break-even point even further and enhancing the benefit to our shareholders of increases in revenues. These truly significant accomplishments would not have been possible without the exceptional efforts of our employees who are without equal in the auction world. We are deeply grateful to them. Our thanks also go to our management team and to our Board of Directors, whose wise counsel and steadfast support have been indispensable during good times and bad. And I know I speak for all of us at Sotheby's when I express our profound appreciation to you, our shareholders, for your patient support. Finally, I welcome the opportunity to thank Bill Ruprecht, whose outstanding leadership and selfless commitment to the people of this great firm are warmly appreciated. This leads quite naturally to my yielding the floor to him. Bill...... [Bill Ruprecht] Thank you, Michael. 2003 was certainly a transforming year for Sotheby's. I too would like to extend my appreciation to all those many people of Sotheby's whose tremendous efforts have helped us over the last year. * Non-GAAP measure. See Appendix A. 2
For the full year 2003, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of ($26.5) million, or ($0.43) per diluted share. 2003 results include pre-tax charges of $16.6 million, or ($0.19) per diluted share related to antitrust charges, employee retention costs and the Company's restructuring plans. Excluding these charges, the Company's adjusted net loss from continuing operations for 2003 would have been ($14.8)* million or ($0.24)* per diluted share. Expense Reduction - ----------------- A continuing goal for Sotheby's over the past four years has been the reduction of our expense structure, an area in which we have made tremendous progress. Total full year 2003 operating expenses from continuing operations, excluding one time costs were over $70* million lower than in 2000. Expense reductions are a priority of management and we will continue to focus on expense savings in 2004. Auction - 2003 - -------------- Throughout a year marked by turbulent economic conditions, works of high quality continued to sell at excellent prices. In 2003, we sold approximately 140 lots for $1 million and above and increased the average selling price per lot by 10%. Among the most notable sold were Andrea Mantegna's Descent Into Limbo, which sold for a record $28.6 million in January and Gustav Klimt's Landhaus am Attersee, which sold for a record $29.1 million in November. Other notable fall sales included the second strongest New York Contemporary Art sales since 1989, strong American Paintings, Old Master Paintings and 20th Century Design sales, and outstanding results from single owner sales including the Bill Blass Collection. These results confirmed the resiliency of the art market and the vibrant demand for outstanding works. 2004 Auctions - ------------- Auction sales in 2004 have gotten off to a tremendous start. However, the most notable event of the first quarter was the landmark private sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberge to Russian industrialist Victor Vekselberg for an undisclosed sum. The fabled nine Imperial Easter Eggs and the other objects in the collection were estimated in excess * Non-GAAP measure. See Appendix A. 3
of $90 million and represent a wealth of Russian culture that can now be returned to its people. On May 18, these will be revealed by Mr.Vekselberg to a distinguished audience in Moscow, including President Vladimir Putin. Our Old Masters Paintings sale in New York performed extremely well, leading the market with a total of $31.2 million. Our Americana Week sales totaled approximately $13.6 million, significantly above its presale high estimate of $12.4 million. Our February London Impressionist and Contemporary sales also performed well. The Impressionist and Modern Art sales brought $75.4 million - double last year's total of $37.1 million. The week of sales was highlighted by Edgar Degas Petite Danseuse de quatorze ans which sold for $9.3 million. In the Contemporary Art sales, Sotheby's led the competition by 70% with an exceptional two days of sales totaling $35.1 million, well above its pre-sale estimate. The evening sale of Contemporary Art, with a total of $27.0 million, set the record for the highest total ever for a Contemporary sale in Europe, and was 93% sold. History was made here at Sotheby's just two days ago with the sale of the Property of the Greentree Foundation from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney when Sotheby's sold the world's most expensive painting at auction, Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe, for $104.2 million. This was the first work of art to break the $100 million threshold and the price shattered the previous record of $82.5 million by over $20 million. Four other auction records were broken here that night for Sir Alfred Munnings, Jean-Frederic Bazille, William Blake and Raoul Dufy with the sale totaling $189.9 million, beating the high estimate of $157.6 million.. Yesterday brought another slate of impressive results with the day and evening sales of Impressionist and Modern Art totaling $125 million, just below the high estimate of $128.8 million and surpassing last year's May Impressionist total of $81.1 million by 54%. Claude Monet's Le Bassin aux Nympheas was the highlight of the evening, bringing $16.8 million, soundly above its high estimate of $12 million. Eighteen lots sold for over $1 million. Including Greentree, the two days of sales totaled $314.9 million, our highest sales total since May 1990. Looking ahead to the upcoming sales in New York, there are a number of exciting auctions on the calendar. Next week is our series of Contemporary Art sales which is estimated between $62.7 and $87.2 million in total. Highlights include works by Roy 4
Lichtenstein, Ellsworth Kelly, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly, Alexander Calder, Gerhard Richter, John Currin and Takashi Murakami. Also this month is our American Paintings sale which is estimated between $33.0 and $47.7 million in total and features another seven paintings from the Greentree Foundation's Collection from the Property of Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney. One of the highlights is John Singer Sargent's portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and His Wife which is considered one of his most daring and modern portraits and is estimated between $5/7 million. London will also be offering a number of extraordinary paintings later in the season. One of the most magnificent paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds, A Portrait of Mrs. Baldwin, will be offered for sale in July and is estimated at $5.4-$7.2 million ('L'3-4 million). Another highly anticipated sale is of Johannes Vermeer's Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, which is the first Vermeer to come to auction in more than eighty years. The authorship of the painting had been under question for most of the 20th century but after a decade of research the scholarly community has declared it authentic. This beautiful canvas is being offered at our Old Masters Paintings sale in London on July 7th and is estimated in excess of $5.4 million ('L'3 million). We also anticipate our strongest London Impressionist and Modern Art painting sale in years in June. Closing: - -------- Bolstered by these developments, notably our increased financing strength, blessed with the very best expertise in the art world, and committed to continued vigilance on costs and increasing our operating leverage, we look forward to a significantly better 2004. This year we mark our Company's 260th anniversary, a milestone that very few companies in the world reach. Now Sotheby's possesses not just a historic past, but a promising future. Once again, we thank our employees, management, Board of Directors and of course you, our shareholders, for your continued support. We will continue to do everything possible to earn it and continue this momentum we have built so far this year. We look forward to continuing the great traditions of Sotheby's. Michael....... 5

EXHIBIT 99.1 News Release - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINAL Press Department: Diana Phillips Matthew Weigman (212) 606-7176 Investor Relations: Jennifer Park (212) 894-1023 SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS o First Quarter Auction and Related Revenues Increased 55% to $59.1 million o Sotheby's Sells the World's Most Expensive Painting at Auction, Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe, for a Record $104.2 million o Sotheby's Leads Impressionist & Modern Art Sales with $314.5 million, up from total of $81.1 million in May 2003 o Highest First Quarter Results since 1999 May 10, 2004, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID; LSE: STBA), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction businesses and art-related financing activities today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004. For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the Company reported auction and related revenues of $59.1 million, compared to $38.1 million in the corresponding period in 2003 for an increase of $21.0 million, or 55%, principally due to the private sale of the Forbes Faberge Collection in February and increased auction commission revenues.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2004, the Company recognized license fee income of $45.0 million related to a one-time license fee received as consideration for entering into a license agreement with Cendant Corporation in conjunction with the sale of its domestic real estate brokerage business in February. The Company's net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2004 was $13.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2003 of ($27.6) million, or ($0.45) per diluted share, due to the increases in revenue discussed above, as well as a significant decrease in restructuring charges and employee retention costs. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $0.9 million, primarily due to antitrust related special charges. During the same period of 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $10.1 million consisting of net restructuring charges of $5.8 million, employee retention costs of $3.5 million and antitrust related special charges of $0.8 million. Excluding these items, the Company would have recorded adjusted net income from continuing operations of $14.1* million, or $0.23* per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2004, as compared to an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of ($21.2)* million, or ($0.34)* per diluted share, in the prior period. Excluding the one-time license fee and expense recorded in conjunction with the license agreement with Cendant Corporation, the Company's net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2004 would have been ($14.8)* million, or ($0.24)* per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2003 of ($27.6) million, or ($0.45) per diluted share. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $0.9 million, primarily from antitrust related special charges. During the same period of 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $10.1 million, detailed above. Excluding these items and the one-time license fee and expense, the Company would have recorded an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of ($14.2)* million, or ($0.23)* per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2004, - -------- * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B. 2
as compared to an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of ($21.2)* million, or ($0.34)* per diluted share, in the prior period, an improvement of 33%. Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales (hammer price plus buyer's premium) in the first quarter have historically only represented approximately 9% - 13% of annual Auction Sales and the first quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, historically, first quarter results have not been indicative of expected full year results. "We are extremely pleased with our first quarter results, especially since the large improvement over prior years is not only due to the Forbes Faberge sale but also to a solid selling season with auction commission revenues increasing $6.3 million, or 20%, from the prior period." said William F. Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. "These strong first quarter results have now been followed by an historic first that took place at Sotheby's last week when a painting from the fabled Whitney Collection broke the $100 million barrier at auction for the first time ever." Second and Third Quarter Sales History was made at Sotheby's last week with the sale of the Property of the Greentree Foundation from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney when Sotheby's sold the world's most expensive painting at auction, Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe, for $104.2 million. The price shattered the previous record of $82.5 million by over $20 million and was the first to break the $100 million threshold. Auction records for four other artists were broken that night for Sir Alfred Munnings, Jean-Frederic Bazille, William Blake and Raoul Dufy, with the sale totaling $189.9 million. 3
The day and evening sales of Impressionist and Modern Art the day after the Greentree Whitney sale brought impressive results as well with a total of $125.0 million, just below the high estimate of $128.8 million. The total surpasses last year's May Impressionist and Modern Art sales total of $81.1 million by 54% which clearly demonstrates the vibrancy of the current market. Eighteen lots sold for over $1 million and Claude Monet's Le Bassin aux Nympheas was the highlight of the evening, bringing $16.8 million, soundly above its high estimate of $12 million. Including the Greentree Whitney sale, the two days of sales led the market by a wide margin with a total of $314.9 million, our highest sales total since May 1990. In April, Sotheby's held a series of strong sales in Hong Kong. The four days of sales totaled $57.1 million, just under its $59.3 million pre-sale low estimate. The Fine Chinese Paintings sale achieved the record of the highest Chinese Paintings auction total in Sotheby's history with a total of $10.5 million. The Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art sales garnered $25.0 million, surpassing its low estimate of $23.7 million and breaking four auction records, the highlight of which was an Anhua-decorated turquoise glazed dish which broke the record for monochrome porcelain and achieved $1.6 million - double its pre-sale low estimate. Also in April, Sotheby's held a series of Photography sales in New York totaling $8.7 million, soundly above the high estimate of $6.7 million with two single owner photograph collections selling 100% of lots offered. Another exceptional auction in New York last month was the sale of Russian Art which garnered $8.1 million, also above its high estimate of $7.3 million. Looking ahead to the upcoming sales in New York, there are a number of exciting auctions on the calendar. Later this week is our series of Contemporary Art sales which is estimated between $62.7 and $87.2 million in total. Highlights include works by Roy Lichtenstein, Ellsworth Kelly, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly, Alexander 4
Calder, Gerhard Richter, John Currin and Takashi Murakami. Also this month is our American Paintings sale which is estimated between $33.0 and $37.7 million in total and features another seven paintings from the Greentree Foundation's Collection from the Property of Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney. One of the highlights is John Singer Sargent's portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and His Wife which is considered one of his most daring and modern portraits and is estimated between $5/7 million. Sotheby's London will also be offering a number of extraordinary paintings later in the season. One of the most magnificent paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds, A Portrait of Mrs. Baldwin, will be offered for sale in July and is estimated at $5.4-$7.2 million ('L'3-4 million). Another highly anticipated sale is of Johannes Vermeer's Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, which is the first Vermeer to come to auction in more than eighty years. The authorship of the painting had been under question for most of the 20th century but after a decade of research the scholarly community has declared it authentic. This beautiful canvas is being offered at our Old Masters Paintings sale in London on July 7th and is estimated in excess of $5.4 million ('L'3 million). Our Impressionist Sale in London on June 21st includes a number of wonderful works, among which are a stunning portrait by Pierre-Auguste Renoir of Rapha Maitre, painted in April 1871 and estimated to sell for $10-14 million, a portrait by Amedeo Modigliani, Garcon a la Veste Bleue, estimated at $6/7.6 million and Claude Monet's Nympheas, estimated at $7-10 million. At the end of June, in Paris, Sotheby's will offer for sale 18th Century Furniture and Works of Art, Old Master and Impressionist/Modern Paintings, Silver and Vertu from The Franco Cesari Collection. This sale is estimated to bring 'E'7/'E'10 million and is the first sale at Sotheby's Paris to include Impressionist and Modern Art. Highlights of the collection include works by Gustave Caillebotte and Camille Pissarro. 5

ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST HALF RESULTS o First Half Auction Sales up 73% to $1.35 billion o Second Quarter Auction and Related Revenues Increased 55% to $166.3 million o Sotheby's Sells the World's Most Expensive Painting at Auction, Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe, for a Record $104.2 million August 9, 2004, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID; LSE: STBA), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction businesses and art-related financing activities today announced results for the second quarter and first half ended June 30, 2004. For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction by the Company ("Auction Sales"), which includes buyer's premium, was $1.1 billion, an increase of 93% from $0.6 billion in the prior period, due to a very strong spring sales season around the world. The Company reported auction and related revenues of $166.3 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $107.6 million in the
corresponding period in 2003, an increase of $58.7 million, or 55%, principally due to higher commission revenues from the extraordinary spring sales. For the second quarter of 2004, the Company's net income was $42.5 million or $0.68 per diluted share. The Company's income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2004 was $40.8 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared to an income from continuing operations of $13.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share in the corresponding period of 2003, an increase of $27.6 million, or 209%. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $0.8 million, primarily due to antitrust related special charges. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $3.0 million, primarily due to employee retention costs. Excluding these items, the Company would have recorded adjusted income from continuing operations of $41.3* million, or $0.66* per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004, as compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $15.1* million, or $0.24* per diluted share, in the prior period. For the first half of 2004, Auction Sales increased 73% to $1.35 billion from $781 million in the prior period, with Sotheby's salesrooms experiencing an exceptional spring sales season internationally. For the first half of 2004, net income was $79.2 million or $1.27 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2004 was $54.3 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared to a loss in the prior period of ($14.5) million, or ($0.24) per diluted share, an increase of $68.8 million. This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in auction commissions, as well as a higher level of private treaty revenues partially offset by increased incentive bonus costs. Also favorably impacting first half results is the recognition of $45.0 million in license fee revenue related to a license fee received as cash consideration for entering into a license agreement with Cendant Corporation in conjunction with the Company's sale of its domestic real estate brokerage business in February. During the first half of 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $1.7 million, primarily attributable to antitrust related special charges which are run-off legal and administrative costs. In the prior period, pre-tax charges were $13.1 million, primarily relating to the Company's employee retention programs and net restructuring charges. Excluding these items and the Cendant license fee revenue and expense, the Company would have recorded an adjusted income from continuing operations of $27.2* million, or $0.44* per diluted - --------------------------- * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B.
share, in the first half of 2004, as compared to an adjusted loss from continuing operations of ($6.0)* million, or ($0.10)* per diluted share, in the prior period, an improvement of $33.2 million. "These are very strong results, which have been achieved not only by an improving art market but also by the unequalled quality of our expert staff and our worldwide marketing abilities, all of which played such key roles in our clients' choice of Sotheby's as auctioneer this spring," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. Mr. Ruprecht continued: "Our results also clearly illustrate the positive operating leverage in our business when revenues climb, which reflect our efforts to bring down our cost structure and allow us to capitalize on a market rebound such as the one we are currently experiencing. Excluding the gain from our sale of the real estate business, operating income from continuing operations* is 15 times that of last year." Sotheby's currently expects the recovery in the international art market to continue and the Company is encouraged by the level of consignments thus far for the fall auction season, which include a number of outstanding single-owner sales. However, it is unlikely that Auction segment results for the second half of 2004 will be at the level achieved in the first half of the year. Aggregate Auction Sales for the second half of the year are traditionally lower than the first half due to the timing of certain sales in the Company's sales calendar. Additionally, the Company does not expect another private sale such as the landmark private sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberge in February 2004, or a replication of the single-owner sale of property of the Greentree Foundation. Second and Third Quarter Sales The highlight of the second quarter was the historic sale of Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe which became the world's most expensive painting sold at auction when it was bought for $104.2 million. This masterpiece from the property of the Greentree Foundation from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney was the first painting to break the $100 million threshold. The entire Greentree collection brought auction sales of $213.1 million.
In New York, the Spring's various owner Impressionist and Modern Art and Contemporary sales also brought outstanding results. The Impressionist and Modern art evening and day sales brought an impressive $125.0 million, leading the market and achieving just below the high estimate of $128.8 million and 54% above last May's total. The New York Contemporary sales totaled $88.8 million, above the high estimate of $86.1 million and almost double the results of May 2003, with the evening sale achieving the rare status of being 100% sold by lot and setting thirteen artist auction records. Spring's American Paintings sale in New York also led the market and beat its high estimate of $46.7 million with a total of $48.7 million. The star of the sale was John Singer Sargent's portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and His Wife, a painting from the Greentree Foundation's Collection from the Property of Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney. The painting was estimated between $5/7 million and sold for $8.8 million. This momentum continued in London in June where Sotheby's sales of Impressionist and Modern Art led the market with $135.7 million, comfortably between the low and high estimates. This was the highest London Impressionist sale series since 1989 with 31 lots selling for above $1 million, again demonstrating the vitality of the market. The highlight was a portrait by Amedeo Modigliani, Garcon a la Veste Bleue, which sold for $11.3 million, well above its estimate of $6/7.6 million. The London Contemporary sales also led the London market and achieved $35.4 million, above the high estimate of $34.6 million. In July in London, Sotheby's Old Masters Paintings sale brought $55.1 million, significantly above its pre-sale high estimate of $38.1 million. A major contribution to the success of that auction was Johannes Vermeer's Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, the first Vermeer to come to auction since 1921. The painting sold for $30 million, a price well in excess of its pre-sale estimate of $5.4 million, with several bidders competing for this work. Upcoming Single Owner Sales Sotheby's will hold a number of exciting single owner sales this autumn. In New York in October, the Americana Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Walter M. Jeffords will be auctioned. The Collection spans many eras of American history from pre-Revolutionary silver to 18th and 19th Century American Furniture.
Highlights are works of early American Silver by Paul Revere and John Coney, outstanding Sporting Art paintings by Sir Alfred J. Munnings, P.R.A., John Frederick Herring and Edward Troye, and important American Furniture with a focus on 18th Century Philadelphian furniture. The Collection is estimated to achieve in excess of $20 million. On October 23rd, Sotheby's New York will offer for sale the Collection of Mrs. Marella Agnelli, widow of Giovanni Agnelli, Chariman of Fiat. The Collection includes important French and Russian Furniture, Works of Art and Porcelain and is estimated between $7 and $11 million. The highlight of the sale is an important Louis XVI Bureau Plat, by the great cabinetmaker Jean-Francois Leleu (estimate $3/5 million). Beginning the fall season in New York will be the sale of property from the estate of Johnny and June Carter Cash on September 14th. Over 780 lots of historic awards, instruments, stage-worn clothing, gold and platinum records, handwritten lyrics, and items from the Cash's personal collection of fine art, furniture and decorations, and jewelry will be offered. The sale of property from these two country music legends is estimated to garner $1/1.5 million. The fourth and final sale of masterpieces from the Time Museum will be held in New York on October 13th. It is comprised of more than 1,250 of the finest time-finding and time-keeping devices in the world. Over the past five years, the three previous sales of the Time Museum's treasures have totaled $39.8 million and this final sale is expected to achieve $8/10 million. Sotheby's London will offer the contents of the Pharmacy restaurant in Notting Hill in October. Designed by Damien Hirst, the sale of 140 lots will feature the entire range of objects that Hirst designed for the restaurant including 10 butterfly paintings in an array of beautiful colours, 11 wall-mounted medicine cabinets and Contemporary furniture and tableware. The sale is expected to realize in excess of $5.4 million. Also in London, Sotheby's will sell an extraordinary collection of stamps formed by one of the most important collectors of the 19th and 20th centuries, Sir Gawaine Baillie. The collection will be auctioned in
a series of ten sales beginning in September, each concentrating on a particular area of study. In all, the sales are estimated to realize in excess of $20 million. In Paris, Sotheby's will offer for sale, in association with a local auctioneer, the private collection of Parisian dealer Mira Jacob, whose gallery, le bateau-lavoir was open from the 1950s-90s. Highlights of the sale include an important group of works by Odilon Redon, a number of remarkable paintings and watercolors by Paul Delvaux and works on paper by Ernst, Giacometti, Picasso and Delaunay among others. The sale is estimated to bring in excess of $5 million and will take place in September. About Sotheby's Holdings, Inc.

Generally, the Company is entitled to a share of the excess proceeds if the property under guarantee sells above a minimum price.

[Sotheby's logo] News Release - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Press Department: Matthew Weigman (212) 606-7176 Investor Relations: Jennifer Park (212) 894-1023 SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS RESULTS o Third Quarter Auction and Related Revenues Increase 48% to $42.9 million o First Nine Months Auction and Related Revenues up 54% to $268.3 million o Impressionist and Modern Art Auction Sales lead market with $232.0 million, our highest various owner sale total in fourteen years November 9, 2004, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction businesses, art-related financing and private sales activities, today announced results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004. For the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company's aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium ("Auction Sales"), was $194.3 million, a 66% increase from $116.8 million in the prior period, largely due to broad-based strong auction sales results, most especially the July Old Master Paintings sales in London. The Company reported auction and related revenues of $42.9 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared to $29.0 million in the corresponding period in 2003, an increase of
48%, principally due to higher commission revenues from the improved summer sales results. For the third quarter of 2004, the Company's net loss was ($28.3) million or ($0.46) per diluted share. The Company's net loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2004 was ($28.3) million, or ($0.46) per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of ($29.5) million, or ($0.48) per diluted share in the prior period, an improvement of $1.2 million. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax antitrust related special charges of $0.4 million. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $2.7 million, primarily due to employee retention costs and antitrust related special charges. Excluding these items, the Company would have recorded an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of ($28.0)* million, or ($0.45)* per diluted share and ($27.7)* million, or ($0.45)* per diluted share, in the third quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively. The third quarter is historically a period of minimal sales activity in the art auction market (typically less than 10% of total annual auction sales for Sotheby's) and, therefore, the Company traditionally reports a loss in the period. For the first nine months of 2004, Auction Sales were $1,547.6 million, an increase of 72% from $897.8 million in the prior period, due to the strength of the art market experienced in Sotheby's salesrooms around the world. For the first nine months of 2004, net income was $50.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted share. Net income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2004 was $26.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to a net loss in the prior period of ($43.4) million, or ($0.70) per diluted share, an improvement of $69.6 million. This upturn was primarily due to a significant increase in auction commissions as well as the recognition of $45.0 million in license fee revenue related to a one-time non-refundable payment received for entering into a license agreement with Cendant Corporation in conjunction with the Company's sale of its domestic real estate brokerage business in February. The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $2.1 million in the first nine months of 2004, largely attributable to antitrust related special charges which are run-off legal and administrative costs. In the first nine months of 2003, pre-tax charges were $15.8 million, primarily due to the Company's employee retention programs - --------------------------- * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B.
and net restructuring charges. Excluding these items and the Cendant license fee revenue and expense, the Company would have recorded an adjusted loss from continuing operations of ($0.7)* million, or ($0.1)* per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2004, as compared to an adjusted loss from continuing operations of ($33.2)* million, or ($0.54)* per diluted share, in the prior period, an improvement of $32.5 million. "These are extremely strong results, which are continuing into the fourth quarter in many collecting categories, including Impressionist and Modern Art," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. Mr. Ruprecht continued: "They demonstrate that the art market is still experiencing the upward trend that began around this time last year." Sotheby's currently expects the recovery in the international art market to continue and the Company is encouraged by the level of consignments for the remainder of the fall auction season, which include a number of outstanding single-owner sales. However, it is unlikely that Auction segment results for the first half of 2005 will be at the level achieved in the first half of 2004, which included the landmark private sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberge and the sale of the world's most expensive painting, Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe, which sold for $104.2 million. Third and Fourth Quarter Sales The highlight of the third quarter was the exceptional Old Master Paintings sales in London which brought $55.1 million, significantly above its pre-sale high estimate of $38.1 million** and 51% above the prior year result of $36.6 million**. A major contribution to the success of that auction was Johannes Vermeer's Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, the first Vermeer to come to auction since 1921. The painting sold for $30 million, a price well in excess of its pre-sale estimate of $5.4 million**. Last week in New York, Sotheby's held its fall series of Impressionist and Modern Art sales. The sales led the market with a total of $232.0 million, with the evening sale bringing the highest various owner sales total for Sotheby's in fourteen years. Three lots were sold for over $20 million, with one of them, a masterpiece by Gauguin, bringing almost $40 million. Twenty eight lots were sold above $1 million and six auction
records were broken for works by Paul Gauguin, Amedeo Modigliani, Piet Mondrian, Henry Moore, Chaim Soutine and Barbara Hepworth. In Hong Kong, Sotheby's fall sales brought $75.8 million, well above last year's total of $44.9 million and the best results in Sotheby's 30-year history in Hong Kong. A highlight of the Magnificent Jewels auction was the sale of an 88.88 carat emerald-cut white diamond for $6.1 million, above its low estimate of $5.4 million**, a record for western jewelry sold in Asia. Another record was set during the Chinese Ceramics sale for a vase from the period of Emperor Qianlong which sold for $5.3 million, above its estimate of $3.9/$5.1 million**, a world auction record for Qing Dynasty porcelain. Single owner sales have also performed extremely well thus far this quarter. Several auctions took place in October in New York: The Americana Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Walter M. Jeffords, which spanned many eras of American history from pre-Revolutionary silver to 18th and 19th Century, brought $18.2 million against an estimate of $16/$24 million**. The fourth and final sale of masterpieces from the Time Museum achieved $18.2 million, about double its pre-sale estimate of $8/$10 million** for the sale of 1,250 of the finest time-finding and time-keeping devices in the world, bringing the total from the four Time Museum sales to $58.6 million. The Collection of Mrs. Marella Agnelli, widow of Giovanni Agnelli, Chairman of Fiat, included important French and Russian Furniture, Works of Art and Porcelain. It totaled $14.2 million, well above its pre-sale estimate of $7/$11 million**. In London, the contents of the Pharmacy restaurant in Notting Hill brought outstanding results. All 140 lots of Contemporary paintings, wall-mounted medicine cabinets and Contemporary furniture and tableware by artist Damien Hirst were sold, totaling $20.0 million, well above the pre-sale estimate of $5.4 million**. Upcoming Sales - --------------------------- ** Estimates do not include buyer's premium.
Our New York Contemporary sales will take place this evening and tomorrow, with tonight's pre-sale estimate between $79.8 million and $106.6 million**. Highlights include works by Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Gerhard Richter, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Jeff Koons. On December 1st in New York, Sotheby's will hold its various owner American paintings sale which will include property from the Cigna Museum and Art Collection as well as American paintings from the Collection of Pierre Berge from his pied-a-terre at the Pierre Hotel in New York. The total sale is estimated to achieve $55.7/$82.2 million**. Included in the various owner American Painting sale is property from the exceptional American art collection of Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Fraad. These 79 lots are estimated between $31.8 million and $47.8 million** and is the most valuable collection of American art ever brought to auction. It includes works by John Singer Sargent, George Bellows, Maurice Prendergast, Everett Shinn and Winslow Homer. The highlight of the collection is John Singer Sargent's Group with Parasols (a Siesta) (estimated at $9/$12 million**), a breathtaking work that was inspired by his travels in the Alpine region in the early 1900s. In Geneva on November 17th, Sotheby's is holding its Magnificent Jewels sale, which includes property from the collection of Maria Callas. The 377 lots have a pre-sale estimate of $24.5/$30.1 million** and include jewels designed by the world's leading jewelry houses such as Harry Winston, Bulgari, Boucheron, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. In London, the current strength of the Russian market is set to be further demonstrated in a series of sales of Russian works of art. The Russian sale on December 1st is estimated to realize between $15.2 - $21.1 million** and includes the largest range of Russian works of art ever offered in a single sale at Sotheby's. Two days later in London, Sotheby's will hold an historic sale of wines from the Russian Imperial Cellars.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On December 15, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. ("Sotheby's" or the "Company") approved an Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Sotheby's, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution pension plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Retirement Savings Plan"). The principal change reflected in the Amendment is to replace the current standard Company contribution to the Retirement Savings Plan of 2% of each participant's eligible compensation to an amount determined at the Company's discretion that will vary depending on the Company's profitability. A copy of the Amendment is included as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K. On December 15, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company also approved the establishment of the Sotheby's, Inc. 2005 Benefit Equalization Plan (the "2005 BEP"). The 2005 BEP, which will supersede approved the Company's existing Benefit Equalization Plan on January 1, 2005, is an unfunded defined contribution plan that is available to certain officers of the Company whose contributions to the Company's Retirement Savings Plan are limited by Internal Revenue Service regulations. The 2005 BEP was established to comply with provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which places new restrictions on deferred compensation arrangements, including limiting the ability of both companies and individuals to revise deferral elections or to accelerate distributions from a deferred compensation plan. The 2005 BEP plan document is included as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K. Item 8.01. Other Events Effective January 2005, the Company will increase its buyer's premium charged on certain auction sales. In salesrooms in the United States (the "U.S."), the buyer's premium will be 20% of the hammer (sale) price on the first $200,000 and 12% of any remaining amount over $200,000. In foreign salesrooms, these U.S. dollar thresholds will be translated into an appropriate fixed local currency amount. Previously, the buyer's premium charged on auction sales was generally 20% of the hammer (sale) price on the first $100,000 and 12% of any remaining amount over $100,000. The Company expects this change to the buyer's premium rate structure to result in an increase in 2005 auction commission revenues. (See statement on Forward Looking Statements.) Item 9.01.

SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. By: /s/ Michael L. Gillis ---------------------- Michael L. Gillis Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer Date: December 15, 2004

EXHIBIT 10.1 THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE SOTHEBY'S, INC. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN (As Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2001) WHEREAS, Sotheby's, Inc. (the "Employer") maintains The Sotheby's, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan As Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2001 (the "Plan"); WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 16.1 of the Plan, the Employer desires to and does hereby amend the Plan effective January 1, 2005 (unless specified otherwise) (1) to increase the Employee pre-tax salary deferral percentage; (2) to modify and rename the current Employer Standard Contribution; (3) to revise the vesting schedule for employees hired on or after January 1, 2005; (4) to implement default automatic rollovers to IRAs for account balances between $1,000 - $5,000 in compliance with statutory requirements; (5) to clarify Employer trading policies regarding investment transfers into and out of the Company Stock Fund; (6) to modify the hardship withdrawal criteria under the Plan; and (7) to make such other changes as the Company deems advisable as hereinafter set forth. NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended as follows: 1. Effective January 1, 2005 all references to "Employer Standard Contributions" throughout the Plan are changed to "Employer Profit Sharing Contributions." 1
2. Section 4.1(b) of the Plan is hereby amended in its entirety by substituting the following: "(b) Supplemental Contributions. Each Participant who has designated a six percent (6%) Basic Contribution Percentage may, upon becoming a Participant or as of the first day of any calendar month thereafter, make Supplemental Contributions equal to any whole percentage of Compensation per payroll period not greater than fourteen percent (14%); provided, however, that the total amount of Basic and Supplemental Contributions in any calendar year may not exceed the amount under Code Section 402(g) as adjusted, or the maximum amount permitted under Sections 5.2 and 11." 3. Section 4.6 of the Plan is amended in its entirety by substituting the following: "Schedule of Employer Matching Contributions. A Participant's Employer Matching Contributions are determined in accordance with the following schedule: *No Employer Matching Contributions apply to Supplemental Before-Tax (i.e. Before-Tax Contributions which exceed 6% of Compensation) or Catch-up Contributions." 2
4. Section 4.7 is amended in its entirety by substituting the following: "4.7 Employer Profit Sharing Contributions. In addition to Employer Matching Contributions provided in Section 4.6, the Company may, in its discretion, make a contribution to the Trust (the "Employer Profit Sharing Contribution") which shall be in a discretionary amount based on the Company's profitability. The Employer Profit Sharing Contribution, together with forfeitures, will be allocated to the accounts of those Participants who are actively employed on the last day of the Plan Year for which the Employer Profit Sharing Contribution is made, pro rata, based on Participant Compensation. The Employer Profit Sharing Contribution for any Plan Year shall be contributed to the Trust on an annual basis (or at such other time as the Employer determines) no later than the last day, including extensions, for filing the Employer's federal income tax return for the Employer's fiscal year ending on or after the last day of the year." 5. Section 6.6(c) is amended in its entirety by substituting the following: "(c) Limitations on Investment in Sotheby's Stock. Any investments in the Sotheby's Stock Fund shall be made at the direction of the Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Article 6; provided, however, that no more than 50% of a Participant's total Plan accounts may be invested in the Sotheby's Stock Fund at any time. The Plan Administrator shall use its best efforts to enforce compliance with this limit. In order to comply with the investment limitations, the Plan provides for the following administrative restriction: A Participant shall not be permitted to direct the investment of more than 50% of his future Employer Matching Contributions and future Employer Profit Sharing Contributions (also referred to as "allocation") into the Sotheby's Stock Fund. Further, if any allocation of future Employer Matching or Employer Profit Sharing Contributions or any transfer of existing Employer Matching, Employer Profit Sharing or Sotheby's Pension Transfer Accounts (exchanges) would cause more than 50% of a Participant's total Plan accounts to be invested in the Sotheby's Stock Fund, such allocation or exchange will not be effective unless a Participant changes such allocation or exchange so that no more than 50% of a Participant's total accounts is invested in the Sotheby's Stock Fund. If, as a result of certain events beyond the control of the Plan Administrator, such as market fluctuations or operations such as Plan distributions, loans, or withdrawals, more than 50% of a Participant's total Plan accounts are invested in the Sotheby's Stock Fund, the Plan will not be deemed to be in noncompliance with this paragraph (c). Participants employed by the Company are subject to the restrictions set forth in the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, as such policy is amended from time to time. Designated employees are also restricted to Company-established window periods for the transfer of existing plan account balances into or out of the Sotheby's Stock Fund. Subject to the 50% limitation described above and the trading window period restrictions, 3
investments into and out of the Sotheby's Stock Fund may be changed in the same manner and at the same time as otherwise provided in this Article 6. Participants subject to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are not permitted to invest their Plan accounts in the Sotheby's Stock Fund at any time." 6. Section 7.2 is amended in its entirety by substituting the following: "7.2 Vesting in Employer Matching Contributions and Employer Profit Sharing Contributions. (a) Employees Hired On Or After January 1, 2005. Except as otherwise provided below, the vested amounts of a Participant's Employer Matching Contribution Account and Employer Profit Sharing Contribution Account for employees hired on or after January 1, 2005, shall be determined by the number of Years of Service completed by the Participant for vesting purposes (as determined under section 7.3) in accordance with the vesting schedule below: (b) Employees Hired Before January 1, 2005. Except as otherwise provided below, the vested amounts of a Participant's Employer Matching Contribution Account and Employer Profit Sharing Contribution account for employees hired before January 1, 2005, shall be determined by the number of Years of Service completed by the Participant for vesting purposes (as determined under section 7.3) in accordance with the vesting schedule below: (c) Full Vesting Upon Normal Retirement Age, Death, Or Disability. Notwithstanding the vesting schedules above, all amounts allocated to a Participant's Employer Matching Contribution Account and Employer Profit 4
Sharing Contribution Account shall automatically become fully vested if the Participant attains Normal Retirement Age or dies or becomes Totally and Permanently Disabled while employed by the Employer." 7. Effective March 28, 2005, Section 8.4 is amended in its entirety by substituting the following: "(a) Amounts not Greater than $1,000. If the total vested amount which a Participant is entitled to receive under the Plan upon termination of employment with the Employer does not exceed $1,000 (excluding amounts attributable to his Rollover Contribution Account), such amount shall be automatically distributed to the Participant in a lump-sum payment as soon as practicable following the date of the Participant's termination of employment with the Employer (and in no event later than the Participant's required beginning date under Section 8.8(b)). (b) Amounts Between $1,000 - $5,000 - Automatic Rollovers. Effective for distributions on or after March 28, 2005, if the total vested amount which a Participant is entitled to receive under the Plan upon termination of employment with the Employer is between $1,000 and $5,000 (excluding amounts attributable to his Rollover Contribution Account), Participant may elect to receive a lump sum payment or a Direct Rollover pursuant to Section 8.13 of the Plan. If the Participant fails to return the distribution election forms provided by the Plan Administrator within a reasonable period of time, a Participant's entire balance under the Plan will be subject to the mandatory automatic IRA rollover rules under Code Section 402(f). These rules provide that a Participant's balance will automatically be rolled over to an IRA at an IRA institution selected by the Plan Administrator and such amounts will be invested in accordance with rules and regulations established by the Department of Labor and the IRS. The Plan Administrator will also establish policies and procedures regarding automatic rollovers of cash-out distributions in accordance with Department of Labor and IRS guidance. (c) Amounts Greater Than $5,000. If the total vested amount which a Participant is entitled to receive under the Plan upon termination of employment with the Employer exceeds $5,000 (excluding amounts attributable to his Rollover Contribution Account) such amount shall not be distributed to the Participant prior to age 65 unless the Participant requests and consents in writing to such distribution. 8. Section 9.2(a) is amended in its entirety by substituting the following: "(a) Immediate and Heavy Financial Need. A Participant shall be permitted to make a hardship withdrawal from the Plan if the Participant certifies that he has incurred an immediate and heavy financial need for funds. For these purposes, an immediate and heavy financial need shall include a need: (1) to pay expenses 5
incurred or necessary for medical care (described in Code Section 213(d)) of the Participant, his spouse, his children, or his dependents; (2) to purchase the principal residence of the Participant (excluding mortgage payments); (3) to pay tuition, related educational fees and room and board expenses for the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the Participant, his spouse, his children, or his dependents; (4) to prevent the eviction of the Participant from his principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage of the Participant's principal residence; a (5) to meet expenses resulting from a severe casualty or property loss, which expenses are above or are not otherwise covered by insurance." IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Amendment is hereby executed on December 15, 2004. SOTHEBY'S, INC. By: Susan Alexander -------------------------- Its: Executive Vice President -------------------------- 6

EXHIBIT 10.2 SOTHEBY'S, INC. 2005 BENEFIT EQUALIZATION PLAN
SOTHEBY'S, INC. BENEFIT EQUALIZATION PLAN TABLE OF CONTENTS i
INTRODUCTION Retirement Savings Plan Maximum Contribution Limitation and Operation of Benefits Equalization Plan The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the "Code") limits the amount of benefits available under qualified 401(k) retirement plans such as the Sotheby's, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the "Retirement Savings Plan"). These limits restrict the amount of employee before-tax contributions that can be made to the Retirement Savings Plan under Code Section 402(g) and the maximum amount of total contributions that can be credited to an employee's account in a single year under Code Section 415. The Code also limits the maximum amount of earnings that may be considered for Retirement Savings Plan contributions under Code Section 401(a)(17). All of these limits are adjusted periodically. Effective January 1, 2005, when a Retirement Savings Plan participant reaches these various limits for employee before-tax salary deferrals or Company contributions, including the Employer Matching Contribution or the Employer Profit Sharing Contribution, subsequent employee before-tax salary deferrals or Company contributions are directed to the employee's 2005 Benefit Equalization Plan Account. 1

SECTION 4 RETIREMENT SAVINGS BENEFITS 4.1 Employee Contributions to the Plan. As a condition of receiving Retirement Savings Benefits in any year, each Eligible Employee who is limited under the Retirement Savings Plan by reason of the Benefit Limitations shall execute and file with the Company a Salary Reduction Agreement. Once applicable Benefit Limitations are reached, the Salary Reduction Agreement authorizes the Employer to reduce the Compensation earned by the Eligible Employee in an aggregate amount equal to the difference, if any, between (a) the deferral election made in the Participant's Salary Reduction Agreement and (b) the aggregate amount of Basic and Supplemental Contributions actually made by Participant under the Retirement Savings Plan. A Salary Reduction Agreement only pertains to amounts earned on or after the first day of the Plan Year. 4.2 Employee Contributions and Salary Deferral Percentage are Irrevocable. Once an Eligible Employee elects to make Employee Contributions to the Plan and such Eligible Employee reaches one or more Benefit Limitations under the Retirement Savings Plan, the Eligible Employee cannot elect to stop making Basic or Supplemental Contributions to the Plan for the remainder of the Plan Year.

A Salary Reduction Agreement authorizes the Company to make payroll deductions between 1% and 12% of the Compensation otherwise payable to an Eligible Employee. Once executed, a Salary Reduction Agreement is irrevocable for that Plan Year. An Eligible Employee cannot change his salary deferral percentage or stop making Employee Contributions to the Plan at any time during the Plan Year. SECTION 5 DISTRIBUTIONS AND WITHDRAWALS 5.1 Withdrawals Upon Unforeseeable Emergency. (a) Unforeseeable Emergency.

Examples of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall include, but shall not be limited to, those financial needs arising on account of a sudden or unexpected illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant's spouse or dependent, loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. (b) Manner of Making Withdrawal. The Participant's request for a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency must be made in writing to the Committee.

The withdrawal shall be paid to the Participant no later than the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the Committee receives the properly completed written request for withdrawal and determines that the Participant satisfies the criteria for an Unforeseeable Emergency. The Committee may from time to time change or adopt additional policies or rules governing withdrawals so that the Plan may be conveniently administered and may comply with applicable laws. 5.2 Distribution Upon Termination of Employment For Any Reason. Such benefits shall be paid to the Eligible Employee in a lump sum payment six (6) months following the last day of the month in which such Participant terminates employment with the Company, or as soon thereafter as is administratively practicable. Distribution may be accelerated in the event of a Participant's death or disability (as defined in the Company's long term disability program). 6
5.3 Distribution Upon Change of Control of Company. Upon a Change of Control of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (as defined in Section 2.5), a Participant's Accounts under the Plan will be distributed in a lump sum payment as soon as practicable following the date of the Change of Control. SECTION 6 SOURCE OF PAYMENT All payments of Retirement Savings Benefits hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company, and no special or separate fund shall be established or other segregation of assets made to assure such payments; provided, however, that the Company may establish a bookkeeping reserve to meet its obligations hereunder. Nothing contained in the Plan and no action taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or the Plan Committee and any Eligible Employee, Participant or other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments form the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for the purposes of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees as described in Sections 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA. SECTION 7 DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY 7.1 Beneficiary Designation. The Beneficiary of each Participant shall be the beneficiary designated by such Participant under the Retirement Savings Plan who shall be entitled to receive the amount, if any, payable under the Plan upon the Participant's death. However, a Participant may designate a Beneficiary different from his or her Beneficiary under the Retirement Savings Plan by filing with the Plan Committee a written designation of one or more persons as his Beneficiary. If a Participant has designated a beneficiary under the Prior BEP, that beneficiary designation shall apply to the 2005 BEP until such designation is changed or revoked. A Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his Beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior Beneficiary by filing a new designation with the Plan Committee. The last such designation received by the Plan Committee shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Plan Committee prior the Participant's death, and in no event shall it be effective as of any date prior to such receipt. 7.2 Failure to Designate Beneficiary. If no such Beneficiary designation is in effect under this Plan or under the Retirement Savings Plan at the time of a Participant's death, or if no designated Beneficiary survives the Eligible Employee, or if such designation conflicts with the law, the Participant shall be deemed to have designated the following Beneficiaries (if then living) in the following order of priority: 7
(a) The spouse of the Eligible Employee. (b) The children of the Eligible Employee and the issue of any deceased child (by right of representation), including adopted children and issue, in equal shares. (c) The parent or parents of the Eligible Employee in equal shares. (d) The estate of the Eligible Employee. If the Plan Committee is in doubt as to the right of any person to receive such amount, the Plan Committee may retain such amount, without liability for any earnings thereon, until the rights thereto are determined, or the Plan Committee may pay such amount into any court of appropriate jurisdiction and such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Plan and the Company therefore. SECTION 8 ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN 8.1 Plan Committee. The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Committee which shall have full power and authority to interpret, construe and administer the Plan and to review claims for benefits under the Plan. The Plan Committee' s interpretations and constructions of the Plan and actions thereunder shall be binding and conclusive on all persons and for all purposes. 8.2 Committee Powers and Duties. The Plan Committee shall engage such certified public accountants, who may be accountants for the Company, as it shall require or may deem advisable for purposes of the Plan. The Plan Committee may arrange for the engagement of such legal counsel, who may be counsel for the Company, and make use of such agents and clerical or other personnel as they shall require or may deem advisable for the purposes of the Plan. The Plan Committee may rely upon the written opinion of such counsel and accountants engaged by the Plan Committee and may delegate to any such agent or to any sub-committee or member of the Plan Committee its authority to perform any act hereunder, including without limitation those matters involving the exercise of discretion, provided that such delegation shall be subject to revocation at any time at the discretion of the Plan Committee. 8.3 Indemnification. To the maximum extent permitted by law, no member of the Plan Committee shall be personably liable by reason of any contract or other instrument executed by him or on his behalf in his capacity as a member of the Plan Committee or for any mistake of judgment made in good faith. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, directly from its own assets (including the proceeds of any insurance policy the premiums of which are paid from the Company' s own assets), each member of the Plan Committee and each other officer, employee, or director of the Company to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan or to the management or control of the assets of the Plan may be delegated or allocated, against any cost or expense (including counsel fees or liability including any 8
sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Company) arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan unless arising out of such person's own fraud, bad faith, or gross negligence. SECTION 9 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated, in whole or in part, by the Board of Directors, or such other committee to which the Board has delegated such authority, but no such action shall retroactively impair or otherwise adversely affect the rights of any person to benefits under the Plan which have accrued prior to the date of such action, as determined by the Plan Committee in its sole discretion. SECTION 10 MISCELLANEOUS 10.1 Successor Employer. This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns, the Eligible Employee, his Beneficiaries and his estate. Nothing in this Plan shall preclude the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation which assumes this Plan and all obligations of the Company hereunder. Upon such a consolidation, merger or transfer of assets and assumption, the term "Company" shall refer to such other corporation and this Plan shall continue in full force and effect. 10.2 Nonguarantee of Employment. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving to an Eligible Employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Employer or as affecting the right of the Employer to dismiss any Eligible Employee. 10.3 Withholdings. The Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Plan all Federal, state, city or other taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling. 10.4 Nonalienation of Benefits. Except insofar as may otherwise be required by law, an Eligible Employee or Beneficiary shall not at any time or in any manner be able to alienate or assign any benefits payable under this Plan, nor shall such benefits be subject to the debts or liabilities of any person and any attempt to so alienate or subject any such amount, whether presently or thereafter payable, to such person's debts or liabilities, shall be void. If any Eligible Employee or Beneficiary shall attempt to, or shall, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, attach, charge or otherwise encumber any amount payable under the Plan, or any part thereof, or if by reason of his bankruptcy or other event happening at any such time such amount would be made subject to his debts or liabilities or would otherwise not be enjoyed by him, then the Plan Committee, if it so elects, may direct that such amount be withheld and that the same or any part thereof be paid or applied to or for the benefit or such person, his spouse, children or 9
other dependents, or any of them, in such manner and proportion as the Plan Committee may deem proper. 10.5 Distributions to Minors and Incompetents. If the Plan Committee shall find that any person to whom any amount is or was payable hereunder is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident, or has died, then the Company, if it so elects, may direct that any payment due him or his Beneficiary (unless a prior claim therefore has been made by a duly appointed legal representative) or any part thereof be paid or applied for the benefit of such person or to or for the benefit of his spouse, children or other dependents, an institution maintaining or having custody of such person, any other person deemed by the Plan Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled to payment, or any of them, in such manner and proportion as the Company may deem proper. Any such payment shall be in complete discharge of the liability of the Plan Committee and the Company. 10.6 Notices. All elections, designations, requests, notices, instructions, and other communications from an Eligible Employee, Beneficiary or other person to the Plan Committee required or permitted under the Plan shall be in such form as is prescribed from time to time by the Plan Committee, shall be mailed by first-class mail or delivered to such location as shall be specified by the Plan Committee, and shall be deemed to have been given and delivered only upon actual receipt thereof at such location. 10.7 Benefits. The benefits payable under this Plan shall be in addition to all other benefits provided for Eligible Employees of the Company. 10.8 Offset. Notwithstanding Section 10.4, if an Eligible Employee or his Beneficiary becomes entitled to a distribution of Plan benefits, and if at such time the Eligible Employee has outstanding any debt, obligation, or other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, then the Company may offset such amount owed to it against the amount of Plan benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made by the Company in its sole discretion. 10.9 Headlines. The captions preceding the sections hereof have been inserted solely as a matter of convenience and in no way define or limit the scope or intent of any provisions of the Plan. 10.10 Governance. The Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan from time to time in effect. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this 2005 Benefit Equalization Plan is hereby executed and the date written below and effective as of January 1, 2005. SOTHEBY'S, INC.

 Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On December 15, 2004, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") disclosed in a Form 8-K that its Compensation Committee had approved: (i) an Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Sotheby's, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution pension plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Retirement Savings Plan") and (ii) the establishment of the Sotheby's Inc. 2005 Benefit Equalization Plan (the "2005 BEP"), an unfunded defined contribution plan that is available to certain officers of the company whose contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan are limited by Internal Revenue Service Regulations. The principal change reflected in the Amendment was to replace the current standard Company contribution to the Retirement Savings Plan of a flat 2% of each participant's eligible compensation to an amount determined at the Company's discretion that will vary depending on the Company's profitability, reflecting the Company's ongoing commitment to controlling costs by reducing its fixed cost base. Since the contribution formula for the 2005 BEP mirrors the contribution formula for the Retirement Savings Plan, the determination by the Compensation Committee of the formula for the Company contribution to the Retirement Savings Plan for any year automatically determines the same formula for the 2005 BEP for that year. On February 7, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved the performance criteria for determining the Company's contribution for both plans for the year ended December 31, 2005. Under these criteria, a Company contribution will be made to both plans in an amount equal to a specified percentage of each participant's eligible compensation only if the Company achieves a specified base level of net income for the year, as determined by the Compensation Committee, and this percentage will increase depending on the achievement by the Company of certain threshold levels of net income in excess of the base level.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [SOTHEBY'S LOGO] News Release - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Press Department: Diana Phillips Matthew Weigman (212) 606-7176 Investor Relations: Jennifer Park (212) 894-1023 SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS o Fourth quarter income from continuing operations increase 106% to $36.1 million o Full year Auction and Related Revenues increase 43% to $443.1 million o Full year income from continuing operations of $62.4 million o Dramatic return to profitability for Sotheby's March 17, 2005, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction businesses, art-related financing and private sales activities, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004. For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company's Auction Sales (aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium), were $1,147.0 million, a 45% increase from $792.9 million in the prior period. Contributing to these results were: the impressive fall New York Impressionist and Modern Art sales which brought $232.0 million, a 59% increase from the prior fall; the November New York Contemporary Art sales of $121.1 million, a 23% increase from the prior year; the winter
New York American Paintings sales which totaled $107.9 million, an almost four-fold increase from the prior year's sale of $31.2 million; and record breaking Hong Kong sales in October of $75.8 million. For the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company reported auction and related revenues of $175.5 million, a 31% or $41.3 million increase from the prior period, largely due to the significant increase in auction sales. The Company's income from continuing operations was $36.1 million or $0.57 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to income from continuing operations of $17.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in the prior-year period, a 106% or $18.5 million improvement. Auction Sales totaled $2,694.5 million for the full year of 2004, an increase of 59% from $1,690.7 million in the prior period. Auction and related revenues for the full year 2004 totaled $443.1 million, an increase of $134.1 million, or 43%, from the prior year largely due to the significant increase in auction sales. This increase was partially offset by lower auction commission margins as a sizeable portion of the increase in auction sales came from high-end works of art for which commission margins are traditionally lower due to the competition for such objects. Income from continuing operations was $62.4 million, or $1.00 per diluted share for the full year 2004, compared to a loss from continuing operations of ($26.0) million, or ($0.42) per diluted share in the prior period, an improvement of $88.4 million. This upturn was primarily due to a significant increase in auction commission revenues as well as the recognition of $45.0 million in license fee revenue related to a one-time non-refundable payment received for entering into a license agreement with Cendant Corporation in conjunction with the Company's sale of its domestic real estate brokerage business in February 2004. For the full year 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $2.4 million, largely attributable to antitrust related special charges which are run-off legal and administrative costs. For the prior period, pre-tax charges were $16.6 million, primarily due to the Company's employee retention programs and net restructuring charges. Excluding these items and the Cendant license fee revenue and associated expense, the Company would have recorded adjusted income from continuing operations of $35.6* million, or $0.57* 2
per diluted share, for the full year 2004, as compared to an adjusted loss from continuing operations of ($14.4)* million, or ($0.23)* per diluted share, in the prior period, an improvement of $50.0 million. The year 2004 saw a significant strengthening of Sotheby's financial position. In addition to the outstanding operating results in 2004, Sotheby's realized proceeds of over $100 million on the sale of its Realty operations in February of 2004 and also signed a three-year credit facility for $200 million. As a result, cash and short-term investments totaled $257 million at December 31, 2004. This dramatic improvement in earnings and significant strengthening of the balance sheet also led to a credit rating upgrade from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's in 2004 and a 33% increase in Sotheby's share price during 2004. "Our focus and our energies have been on a return to profitability and in 2004 we successfully achieved that goal," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. "2004 was a remarkable year for Sotheby's and we are delighted with these results. The 45% increase in sales for the fourth quarter translated to a doubling of net income, dramatically reflecting the operating leverage in the business and we have seen even larger gains in sales and net income for the full year. We will continue to challenge the Company's cost structure and seek additional opportunities for revenue growth. "Sotheby's made history both in auction sales and in private sales last year," Mr. Ruprecht continued. "Sotheby's auctioned the world's most expensive painting when Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe crossed the $100 million threshold for the first time and sold for $104.2 million. And the sale of the fabled Faberge Collection from the Forbes family became possibly the largest private sale ever when the collection was acquired privately in its entirety and repatriated to Russia. 3
"Sotheby's ability to attract extraordinary paintings and objects for sale last year, coupled with a strong art market, resulted in broad-based strength across a number of categories and geographic locations. That strength has continued into 2005 and we are encouraged by the 41% increase in sales for the first two months of 2005 compared to 2004 as well as the level of consignments for the spring season." Throughout the year, many extraordinary prices were achieved across a multitude of collecting categories. Sotheby's sold eight of the top ten lots sold at auction in 2004, which was a remarkable achievement. Along with Pablo Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe that sold in May for a world record $104.2 million, Amedeo Modigliani's Jeanne Hebuterne (Devant une Porte) sold for $31.4 million, Johannes Vermeer's A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals sold for $30.0 million, John Singer Sargent's Group with Parasols (a Siesta) sold for $23.5 million and Paul Gauguin's Maternite (II) sold for $39.2 million. Outstanding results were also posted in a number of single owner sales during 2004. The most notable examples were the Greentree Foundation sale of Property from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney, which brought $213.2 million and was our highest total ever for a single owner sale; Rita and Daniel Fraad's record breaking Collection of American Paintings which brought $65.1 million, the highest auction total ever for a single owner sale of American paintings; the contents of contemporary artist Damien Hirst's restaurant Pharmacy which was 100% sold and totaled $20.1 million, more than double its pre-sale estimate; the collection of extraordinary timepieces from the Time Museum which sold for $18.2 million; and the Estate of Katharine Hepburn which also was 100% sold and achieved $6.1 million. Sotheby's experienced a three-fold increase in single owner sales volume from the prior year and our highest yearly total of single owner sales in fourteen years. Year to Date 2005 Sales Worldwide sales have been strong to date, highlighted by the exceptional Impressionist and Contemporary sales held last month in London. The London Impressionist and 4
Modern Art sales achieved $103.8 million, up 37% from the prior year with ten works selling for more than (pound)1 million. The top lot of the sales was a masterpiece by Fernand Leger entitled Nature Morte a la Lampe which achieved $5.4 million. The Contemporary Art sales also fared exceptionally well, totaling $42.0 million, an increase of 19% from the prior winter, with the evening sale achieving the highest total ever for a European Contemporary sale at Sotheby's. In January, Sotheby's New York held an extremely strong week of Americana sales. The week total led the market with $25.3 million, a significant increase of 86% from the prior year. This was largely due to the exceptional single owner sale of property from the Goddard Family which included some of the finest examples of American furniture and achieved a total of $13.1 million, well in excess of its pre-sale estimate of $4.3/$8.7** million. Also in New York, the Old Masters Paintings sales led the market with a total of $44.2 million, soundly above its estimate of $28.8/$39.8** million. The highlight of the series was An Important Lead Bust of the so-called "Ill-Humored" Man by Franz Xaver Messerschmidt which sold for $4.8 million, more than ten times the estimate of $300,000/$500,000**. Upcoming Sales Sotheby's May 3rd sale of Impressionist and Modern Art in New York will feature Wassily Kandinsky's rediscovered masterpiece Zwei Reiter und liegende Gestalt (Two Riders and a Reclining Figure) which has been unseen for nearly a century and largely unknown to scholars. This brilliant abstract painting from the artist's most important period is estimated to sell for $15/$25** million. Also included in the sale are works from the Collection of Dr. and Mrs. John A. Cook which is highlighted by Pablo Picasso's Les Femmes d'Algers, from the iconic series of fifteen canvases he painted of North African women. The painting is estimated to bring $10/$15** million. Another outstanding highlight of the sale is a striking self-portrait by Max Beckmann, entitled Self 5
Portrait with Crystal Ball. Beckmann painted this portrait of himself as a prescient sooth-sayer, in 1936, just months before he fled Germany for Holland and it is a powerful testament of the artist's determination to persevere during those troubled times. The painting is in wonderful original condition and is estimated at $10/$15** million. Also in May in New York, Sotheby's is holding its sale of Contemporary Art which will be highlighted by Andy Warhol's magnificent Liz. This work is one of a rare series of thirteen paintings of Elizabeth Taylor and the only one to possess the vibrant `naphthol red light' background that was reserved for Warhol's most concentrated and important compositions. The painting is estimated to sell for $9/$12** million. Other works in the Contemporary sale will come from the Collection of Gianni Versace, some of which were commissioned directly from the artists by Versace. Works by Roy Lichtenstein, Jean-Michel Basquiat and the collaborative genius of Basquiat and Warhol, as well as Francesco Clemente will also be auctioned. Yesterday in Paris we held the first session of the sale of the estate of the Baron de Rede from the Hotel Lambert. The sale at the Galerie Charpentier includes exquisite works of art which illustrate Alexis de Rede's fine sense of aesthetics and his modern, eclectic taste. The first session, estimated at $3.5/$6.0** million surpassed the high estimate when it brought a very successful $6.8 million. The entire sale estimated to achieve $4.4/$7.2** million Our spring Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art sale in New York at the end of the month will feature several exceptional examples of ceramics and a selection of approximately 200 snuff bottles from the Collection of Ms. Avrina Pugh, Racine, Wisconsin, which have been off the market for over sixty years. The sale is expected to achieve $7/$9** million. In May, Sotheby's will sell a large collection of selected paintings, furniture and works of art from Easton Neston house in Northamptonshire on behalf of the Lord and Lady 6
Hesketh and the Trustees of Frederick, 2nd Baron Hesketh. Easton Neston is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful country houses in England and its contents are no less magnificent. Together, the pieces to be sold (some 1,500 items of fine English and French furniture, Old Master and British Paintings, Tapestries, Silver, Books, Chinese cloisonne, Japanese lacquer work, European Porcelain and Glass) represent centuries of patronage and collecting at the highest level. Easton Neston is exceptionally rich in great works of art from different fields, making it one of the most eclectic and exciting house sales to have been organized by Sotheby's over the last 20 years. The three day sale is expected to garner in excess of $9.0** million. * Non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B. ** Estimates do not include buyer's premium. About Sotheby's Holdings, Inc.

SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES 2005 FIRST
      
QUARTER RESULTS
 - 
Strong First Quarter Auction Sales Across All Sales Categories
 - 
First Quarter Auction and Related Revenues increase 23% to $72.2 million
 
 
May 11, 2005, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction, private sales and art-related financing activities, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, the Company's Auction Sales (aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium) were $356.0 million, a 53% increase from $233.2 million in the prior period, primarily due to the London Impressionist and Modern Art and Contemporary sales in February, which were up 37% as compared to the prior year, and a significant increase ($40.2 million) in single owner sales over the period. The Company reported auction and related revenues of $72.2 million, a 23%, or $13.3 million, increase from the prior period, principally due to the significant increase in auction sales. The Company's loss from continuing operations was ($9.7) million, or ($0.16) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2005 compared to
 
 
 
income from continuing operations of $13.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. This decrease was principally due to the $45.0 million one-time license fee revenue received from Cendant in the first quarter of 2004. Excluding the one-time license fee revenue, the Company's first quarter 2004 loss from continuing operations would have been ($14.9) million*, or ($0.24)* per diluted share, yielding a $5.1 million improvement in first quarter 2005 results from continuing operations as compared to the prior period, a great achievement in light of the fact that 2004 results included the landmark sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberg.
 
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales in the first quarter have historically only represented approximately 9% - 12% of annual Auction Sales, and the first quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, historically, first quarter results have not been indicative of expected full year results.
 
"As these excellent results show, 2005 is clearly off to a strong start," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. They are all the more outstanding given their improvement on last year's first quarter results (excluding the one-time license fee revenue) which included the landmark private sale of the Forbes Collection of Imperial Faberg. Auction commission revenues increased $21.5 million, or 56%, quarter on quarter. The growth in auction commission revenues was offset by a decline in private sale commission revenues due to the Faberg transaction in 2004.
 
Second and Third Quarter Sales
Last week, Sotheby's held its spring sale of Impressionist and Modern Art in New York. While below our expectations, there were some notable highlights such as Pablo Picasso's
Les Femmes d'Algers
,
from the iconic series of fifteen canvases Picasso painted of North African women which brought $18.6 million, well within its estimate of $15/$20million
*
*
. Another highlight of the sale was a striking self-portrait by Max

Beckmann, entitled
Self Portrait with Crystal Ball
which is a portrait of the artist as a prescient sooth-sayer, painted in 1936, just months before he fled Germany for Holland. The painting is in wonderful original condition and sold for $16.8 million, just above its estimate of $10/$15 million**. In total, the Impressionist sales achieved $118.6 million.
 
Early last week, Sotheby's Hong Kong held a very successful series of sales, indicating the continued strength of the Chinese art market. Chinese paintings, both Contemporary Oils and Modern masters, in Chinese brush and ink technique, performed extremely well. The sale total of $24.3 million was by far the highest Chinese Paintings sale Sotheby's has held, exceeding its high estimate of $20.2 million by 20%. Mainland Chinese buyers were exceptionally strong participants in the sale, continuing a trend in the Chinese paintings world for the last few years. The Ceramics and Works of Art sales, led by the Collection of Exceptional Imperial Porcelain, which was 100% sold and included a world record for Qing Dynasty porcelain for a reticulated celadon Vase ($5.7 million), also performed very well, bringing $33.3 million, the highest total ever for a Ceramics sale in Hong Kong.
 
Sotheby's held its inaugural combined sale of Russian fine and applied works of art in New York last month and achieved extraordinary results. The sale brought $35.2 million, against a pre-sale estimate of $15.6/$22.2 million, the highest total ever for Russian Art worldwide. Among the many highlights of the sale were a
Magnificent Pair of Russian Porcelain Palace Vases, from the Period of Nicholas I
that sold for a record $3.9 million, more than five times its high estimate, and a rediscovered masterpiece by Konstantin Egorovich Makovsky,
Judgment of Paris
, from the collection of the Pabst Brewing Company, which sold for a record-breaking $2.1 million. Next week, Sotheby's will hold its London sale of Russian Art which is estimated to achieve more than $15 million** for approximately 260 lots.
 
Upcoming Sales

Next week in New York, Sotheby's spring sale of American Paintings features Property from The Collection of Mr. & Mrs. Thomas J. Watson, Jr., son of Former IBM Chairman Thomas J. Watson, Sr., and includes works by James Edward Buttersworth, Mary Cassatt and Andrew Wyeth. The total sale is estimated to bring between $31.5 and $45.4 million** for its broad selection of works by important American artists, spanning from the late 19th century to the 1980s.
 
Among the exciting sales that will take place in Europe are two important house sales. Next week in London, Sotheby's will sell a large collection of selected paintings, furniture and works of art from Easton Neston house in Northamptonshire, widely considered to be one of the most beautiful country houses in England. The three day sale is expected to bring in excess of $9 million**. In Germany this autumn, the contents of the Marienburg Castle will be sold on site, including works belonging to the former royal ruling house of Hanover, among them several British kings. The sale is expected to achieve in excess of $16 million** for approximately 5,000 lots.
 
In June, Sotheby's will hold an auction of fine Ferraris and Maseratis in conjunction with Ferrari. The sale will take place at Ferrari's headquarters in Maranello, Italy and will consist of 37 cars and 100 lots of memorabilia. The highlight of the sale is 1958 Ferrari 412 S, #0744, which has an illustrious past in North American racing and is fitted with the most powerful front engine offered by Ferrari at that time. It is estimated to realize $9/$13 million**. The total sale is estimated to achieve in excess of $45 million**.
 
Our major Impressionist Sale in London on June 20
th
includes a number of wonderful works, among which are Paul Gauguin's
Nature Morte aux Mangos
(estimated at $5.6/$7.5 million**), executed during the artist's second stay in Tahiti; two works by Edgar Degas,
Chevaux et Jockeys
and
Danseuses rajustant leur Coiffure
, representing the two main themes the artist developed throughout his artistic career: ballet dancers and horse races (both are estimated at $2.3/$3.4 million**) and a painting by
 
4
 
 
 
Pablo Picasso,
Homme  la pipe
(estimated at $4.7/$6.6 million**) from the artist's series dedicated to the theme of the musketeer.
 
Our summer sale of Old Masters Paintings in London on July 6
th
includes some of the finest offerings of Old Masters Paintings to come to auction in years. The sale is highlighted by Canaletto's
View of the Grand Canal from Palazzo Balbi to the Rialto
(estimate $11/$15 million**) which was one of the first paintings to adorn the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in London in the early 1700s. The sale also includes another important Canaletto, his
Venice, The Grand Canal from the Palazzo Flangini to S. Marcuola
which is estimated at $10/$15 million**.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, the Company reported auction and related revenues of $175.6 million, a 6%, or $9.4 million, increase from the prior period, despite a 13% decrease in Auction Sales to approximately $1.0 billion (aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium). This increase in auction and related revenues is a result of significant improvements in auction commission margins, primarily due to a lower level of major single owner sales in 2005 which traditionally have lower auction commission margins, as well as an increase in the buyer's premium rates in early 2005. The Company's income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2005 was $42.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to income from
 
 
 
continuing operations of $41.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
For the first half of 2005, auction and related revenues were $247.7 million, a 10% or $22.7 million improvement compared to the prior period. This rise is due to the increase in auction commission margins discussed above. Income from continuing operations for the first half 2005 was $32.7 million, a $21.8 million decrease from 2004 due to the $45.0 million one-time license fee revenue received from Cendant in the first quarter of 2004. Excluding the one-time license fee revenue, the Company's first half 2004 income from continuing operations would have been $26.3 million*, or $0.42* per diluted share. Excluding the 2004 license fee revenue, first half 2005 results improved $6.4 million, or 24%, a significant achievement considering the landmark events of first half 2004 which included the historic private sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberg and $213.1 million in Auction Sales from the Whitney Greentree Collection.
"These excellent second quarter 2005 results include our highest second quarter revenues ever and our best income from continuing operations since 1990 which is a result of strong auctions across our global selling locations, a high level of private sale activity, and significantly improved auction commission margins," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc.
By region, auction and related revenues in North America were flat for the first half of 2005 compared to the prior period, primarily due to the absence of a comparable sale to the Whitney Greentree sale in 2005, which was offset by growth and higher auction commission margins in a range of collecting categories. European revenues were up 12% and Asian revenues were up an extraordinary 54%.
Sotheby's expects the current buoyancy in the international art market to continue and the Company is encouraged by the level of consignments thus far for the fall auction season.

However, we cannot currently predict whether Auction Sales for the second half of 2005 will attain the same levels as the second half of 2004.
Second and Third Quarter Sales
Sotheby's Spring sale of American Paintings in New York brought a strong $40.4 million, towards the high end of its pre-sale estimate of $31.5 to $45.2 million**. The highlight of the sale was Andrew Wyeth's
Battle Ensign
which sold for $3.8 million, almost double its pre-sale estimate of $1.5/2 million** and came from the Collection of Mr. & Mrs. Thomas J. Watson, Jr., son of Former IBM Chairman Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
Our June sales in London also achieved excellent results. The Impressionist and Modern Art Sales totaled $108.6 million, well within its pre-sale estimate of $97.8 to $137.3 million** with 88% of lots selling at or above their high estimates. The star of the sales was Kees Van Dongen's
Femme au grand chapeau
which sold for $9.2 million and set a new record at auction for Van Dongen, almost double the previous record. Other highlights were works by Paul Signac, Maurice de Vlaminck, Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso. The London Contemporary Sale garnered $48.4 million, towards the high side of its pre-sale estimate of $37.4 to $53.3 million and the highest total to date for a Sotheby's London Contemporary sale.
Also in London, our July summer sale of Old Masters Paintings was held to extraordinary results. It led the market with a total of $87.7 million, close to its pre-sale high estimate of $90.0 million**. The undisputed highlight of the sale was Canaletto's
Venice, the Grand Canal, Looking North-East from Palazzo Balbi to the Rialto Bridge
which sold for $32.6 million, more than double its pre-sale estimate of $11/$14 million** and is the highest price achieved thus far this year at any auction.
Upcoming Single Owner Sales
Sotheby's has been chosen by the New York Public Library to sell sixteen works of art from its private collection. The consignment is primarily comprised of American

paintings and sculptures and is expected to bring between $22 and $31 million** this fall in New York.

Safra, including magnificent French, Continental and English Furniture, Decorative Works of Art, Clocks, Porcelain, Paintings, Carpets, Faberg and Russian Works of Art. The sale is estimated to achieve in excess of $25 million**.
On October 11-12, also in New York, Sotheby's will be selling a range of decorative arts and Impressionist paintings from the Collection of Mr. Laurance S. Rockefeller, the pioneering venture capitalist and dedicated conservationist and philanthropist. The proceeds of the sale, estimated to bring in excess of $12 million**, will benefit the Laurance S. Rockefeller Fund, a charitable entity.
In Germany from October 5
th
to 15

On September 7, 2005, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company") entered into a Transaction Agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of such date, with various affiliates of A. Alfred Taubman and his family (the "Shareholders"). Prior to completion of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Shareholders were the Company's largest shareholders, holding in the aggregate 14,034,158 shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Class B Stock"), representing approximately 62.4% of the aggregate voting power of the Company's capital stock. In addition, Robert S. Taubman, A. Alfred Taubman's son, is a director of the Company.
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange all 14,034,158 shares of Class B Stock owned by the Shareholders for $168,409,896 in cash and 7.1 million shares of the Company's Class A Limited Voting Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Class A Stock"), (such exchange, the "Transaction"). (See "Mechanics of Effecting the Transaction; Funding" below.) Completion of the Transaction was not subject to any conditions and it was completed on September 7, 2005. Because the outstanding shares of Class B Stock constituted less than fifty percent of the aggregate voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock following completion of the Transaction, pursuant to the Company's Third Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles"), following completion of the Transaction each outstanding share of Class B Stock was automatically converted into one share of Class A Stock without any action on the part of the holder thereof. Following completion of the Transaction and such conversion, the Company had outstanding approximately 57.3 million shares of Class A Stock (of which the Shareholders owned 7.1 million, or approximately 12.4%) and no shares of Class B Stock.
Mechanics of Effecting the Transaction; Funding
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Transaction was effected by means of: (1) the Shareholders voluntarily converting, on a one-for-one basis pursuant to the Articles, 7.1 million shares of Class B Stock into shares of Class A Stock, and (2) the Company acquiring the remaining shares of Class B Stock owned by the Shareholders for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $168 million. The Company has funded or will fund the cash portion of the consideration plus approximately $10 to $13 million in direct transaction and financing costs with existing cash balances and $100 million in borrowings under the new credit facility (as described below). Direct transaction costs of approximately $7 to $10 million attributable to the Transaction will be accounted for as part of the cost to acquire the Class B Stock owned by the Shareholders and will be recorded as a reduction of the Company's Shareholders' Equity. Direct financing costs of $2.6 million attributable to the new credit facility (as described below) will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the facility.
 
 
 
 
Composition of the Board of Directors and Committees
Under the terms of the Agreement, concurrently with the completion of the Transaction, Robert S. Taubman resigned from the Executive Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. See also Item 5.02 below.
Standstill
In the Agreement, each Shareholder agreed to a customary standstill lasting until the earlier of the (1) fourth anniversary of the Transaction or (2) 30 days after the date on which (a) the Shareholders, together with their affiliates, own, in the aggregate, securities representing less than ten percent of the Company's total outstanding voting power and (b) no affiliate of any Shareholder is a member of the board of directors of the Company (however, if such 30th day would otherwise occur on or before the second anniversary of the Transaction, such 30th day would not be deemed to occur until such second anniversary). Under the standstill, each Shareholder agreed, unless requested by the Company, not to:
Restrictions on Transfer
In the Agreement, each Shareholder agreed that, prior to the second anniversary of the Transaction, such Shareholder would not transfer any shares of Class A Stock or any economic interest therein, except to an affiliate of such Shareholder in connection with tax- or estate-planning transactions, or, to the extent permitted by law, for sales of shares of Class A Stock in any three month period, that when aggregated with sales by all other Shareholders in such period, would not exceed the greater of one percent of the outstanding shares of Class A Stock or the average weekly trading volume of the Class A Stock during the four weeks preceding such sale.
 
 
 
 
 
Registration Rights
In the Agreement, the Company agreed that, following the second anniversary of the Transaction and on not more than two occasions, the Shareholders would have the right to require the Company to file a registration statement under the federal securities laws registering the sale of all or a portion of the shares of Class A Stock owned by the Shareholders that are not otherwise freely tradable, provided that the market value of the securities proposed to be sold exceeds specified thresholds. The Company has the right to defer the filing of such registration statement if doing so would impede any material transaction involving the Company, adversely affect any financing contemplated by the Company or require disclosure of any material non-public information that, if disclosed at such time, would be harmful to the interests of the Company or its shareholders. The Company also agreed to allow the Shareholders to participate in any registration statement proposed to be effected by the Company following the second anniversary of the Transaction, subject to restrictions in the event that the Shareholders' participation would adversely affect the Company's registration.
The Company agreed to pay all expenses incurred in connection with such registration, other than any underwriting discounts or commissions, and also agreed to indemnify each Shareholder from losses incurred as a result of material misstatements or omissions in such registration statement (other than those that are the responsibility of the Shareholders, losses incurred by the Company as a result of which would be subject to indemnification from the Shareholders).
Other Provisions
The Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties from the Company and each Shareholder, including as to organization, authority, execution and delivery, enforceability, absence of conflicts and required filings, finder's fees and litigation. Each Shareholder also made representations and warranties to the Company as to title to the share of Class B Stock being acquired, the absence of any agreements with respect to the shares of Class B Stock being acquired and such Shareholder's intentions with respect to the share of Class A Stock being acquired. Each of the Company and the Shareholders also agreed to take such further actions as may be necessary to carry out the intents of the Agreement.
New Senior Secured Credit Facility
On September 7, 2005, in connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into a new senior secured credit agreement with an international syndicate of lenders arranged by Banc of America Securities LLC ("BofA") and LaSalle Bank N.A. (the "BofA Credit Agreement"). The BofA Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of up to $200 million through a revolving credit facility; however, the Company may on a one-time basis increase the amount of available borrowings to $250 million. The amount of borrowings available at any time under the BofA Credit Agreement is limited to a borrowing base, which is generally equal to 100% of eligible loans made by the Company (i.e., notes receivable and consignor advances) plus 15% of the Company's net tangible assets (calculated as total assets less current liabilities, goodwill, unamortized debt discount and eligible loans).
 
 
 
 
The BofA Credit Agreement is available through September 7, 2010; provided that in the event that any of the $100 million in long-term debt securities (the "Notes") issued by the Company in February 1999 are still outstanding on July 1, 2008, then either: (a) the Company shall deposit cash in an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes on such date into an account in the sole control and dominion of BofA for the benefit of the lenders and the holders of the Notes or (b) the Company shall have demonstrated its ability to redeem and pay in full the Notes; otherwise the BofA Credit Agreement shall terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder shall be due and payable in full on July 1, 2008.
Borrowings under the BofA Credit Agreement are available to be used to: (a) finance in part the Transaction and related fees and expenses and (b) provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes of the Company.
The Company's obligations under the BofA Credit Agreement are or will be secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, as well as the assets of its subsidiaries in the United States ("U.S.") and the United Kingdom ("U.K.").
The BofA Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company not to exceed a maximum level of capital expenditures and dividend payments (as discussed in more detail below) and to have a quarterly interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.0 and a quarterly leverage ratio of not more than: (i) 4.0 for quarters ending September 30, 2005 to September 30, 2006, (ii) 3.5 for quarters ending December 31, 2006 to September 30, 2007 and (iii) 3.0 for quarters ending December 31, 2007 and thereafter. The maximum level of annual capital expenditures permitted under the BofA Credit Agreement is $15 million through 2007 and $20 million thereafter with any unused amounts carried forward to the following year. Dividend payments, if any, must be paid solely out of 40% of the Company's net income arising after June 30, 2005 and computed on a cumulative basis. The BofA Credit Agreement also has certain non-financial covenants and restrictions.
At the option of the Company, any borrowings under the BofA Credit Agreement generally bear interest equal to: (i) LIBOR plus 1.75%, or (ii) 0.5% plus the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%.
The Company believes that operating cash flows, any cash or short-term investment balances and borrowings available under the BofA Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet its short-term and long-term commitments, operating needs and capital requirements for the next twelve months and through the expiration of the BofA Credit Agreement. (See statement on Forward Looking Statements.)
On September 7, 2005, in connection with the Transaction described under Item 1.01 above, the Company terminated its senior secured credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (the "GE Capital Credit Agreement"). The GE Capital Credit Agreement provided for borrowings of up to $200 million through an international syndicate of lenders and was originally available through March 4, 2007. The amount of borrowings available at any time under the GE Credit Agreement was limited to a borrowing base determined pursuant to the terms thereunder.
 
 
 
 
The Company's obligations under the GE Capital Credit Agreement were secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, as well as the assets of its subsidiaries in the U.S. and the U.K.
The GE Capital Credit Agreement contained financial covenants requiring the Company not to exceed $15 million in annual capital expenditures, not to make dividend payments and to have a quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0. The GE Capital Credit Agreement also had certain non-financial covenants and restrictions.
At the option of the Company, any borrowings under the GE Capital Credit Agreement were generally subject to interest equal to: (i) 1.00% plus the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.5%. Pursuant to the GE Capital Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, the applicable interest rate charged for borrowings was adjusted up or down depending on the Company's performance under a quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio test.
As a result of the termination of the GE Capital Credit Agreement, the Company incurred a $1 million termination fee and wrote off approximately $2.2 million in arrangement fees and other direct costs related to the GE Capital Credit Agreement, which were previously being amortized over the term of the agreement.
The disclosure set forth under Item 1.01 above is incorporated herein by reference.
Jeffrey H. Miro, who has been a director of the Company since April 1998, has indicated that he does not intend to seek re-election at the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders.

Item 3.01
 
On September 7, 2005, Sotheby's Holding's, Inc. (the "Company") ceased to be a Controlled Company as defined in Rule 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). As a Controlled Company, the Company was not required to have a Charter for its Compensation Committee, and the Company does not have such a Charter. On September 9, 2005 the Company was advised by the NYSE that, as a result of its failure to have a Charter for its Compensation Committee, it is not in compliance with a listing standard of the NYSE. The Company intends to cure this noncompliance by adopting a Charter for its Compensation Committee at the next meeting of its Board of Directors, which is currently scheduled for November 7, 2005.
 
The Commentary to Section 303A.03 of the NYSE requires each listed company to disclose in its proxy statement the name of the director chosen to preside at executive sessions of non-management directors. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on the Company's website (for which a link is provided in the Company's Proxy Statement dated April 15, 2005), provide that the Company shall hold regularly scheduled executive sessions of non-management Directors and that the Chairman of the Board shall preside over such sessions; however, the Company inadvertently failed to identify Michael I. Sovern, Chairman of the Board, as the director who presides over executive sessions of non-management directors in this Proxy Statement. On September 9, 2005, the NYSE advised the Company that the failure of the Company to disclose in its Proxy Statement that its Board of Directors holds regularly scheduled meetings of non-management directors over which Mr. Sovern presides constituted noncompliance with Section 303A.03. The NYSE also advised the Company of alternative methods for curing the noncompliance, including filing a Form 8-K with the required disclosure.
 
Although the Company does not believe that its failure to specify in its Proxy Statement that Mr. Sovern presides over executive sessions of non-management directors is material, the Company is correcting its noncompliance by filing this Form 8-K. In future years, the Company will include this disclosure in its Proxy Statement.
 
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Item 5.03
 
On September 7, 2005, the Company amended Sections 8.02 and 8.05 of its Amended and Restated By-Laws to provide for the issuance of substitute stock certificates, in place of lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, that are either signed by the appropriate officers of the Company and sealed or countersigned by the appropriate Transfer Agent and registered by the appropriate Registrar. A copy of the Company's Amended and Restated By-Laws reflecting the foregoing amendments is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K.

SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES 2005 THIRD
QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS RESULTS
 
   
 - 
Third Quarter Auction and Related Revenues up 26% to $53.7 million
 
   
 - 
Highest Third Quarter Revenues in Company History
 
   
 - 
Operating Results from Continuing Operations Improve $12.2 million, or 36%, for the Third Quarter
 
 
November 7, 2005, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction, private sales and art-related financing activities, today announced results for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2005.
 
The Company reported auction and related revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 of $53.7 million, a 26%, or $11.1 million, improvement from the prior period. This growth in auction and related revenues is due to increased auction commission revenues and expense recoveries, as well as higher private sale commissions. For the third quarter of 2005, the Company's loss from continuing operations was ($21.2) million, or ($0.35) per diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of ($28.3) million, or
 
 
 
($0.46) per diluted share, in the prior-year period, an improvement of $7.1 million, or 25%, primarily due to the increase in auction and related revenues discussed above. Included in the Company's loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 are one-time pre-tax charges of $2.9 million for terminating the GE credit facility agreement as a result of the Company's successful refinancing with the Banc of America. Excluding this expense, loss from continuing operations would have been ($19.2) million*, an improvement of $9.0 million, or 32%, from the prior period.
 
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales (aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium) in the third quarter have historically only represented approximately 9% - 12% of annual Auction Sales, and the third quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, historically, third quarter results have not been indicative of expected full year results.
 
Excluding the one-time license fee revenue received from Cendant in the first quarter of 2004 and associated expense, the Company's income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2005 would have improved by $13.5 million*, a significant achievement considering the landmark events of 2004 which included the historic private sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberg and $213.1 million in Auction Sales from the Whitney Greentree Collection. For the first nine months of 2005, auction and related revenues were $301.4 million, a $33.8 million, or 13%, increase from the prior period, primarily due to higher auction commission revenues which were partially offset by lower private sale commissions and principal activities. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2005 was $11.5 million, a $14.8 million decrease from the prior period due to the $45.0 million one-time license fee revenue received in the first quarter of 2004.
 
"With our highest third quarter revenues ever, and very strong sales thus far in the fourth quarter, we are very optimistic about our business," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "Record-breaking sales in Hong Kong, very
 
2
 
 
 
profitable Impressionist and Modern Art sales last week in New York and a number of outstanding single owner sales around the world have all contributed to this momentum and are indications of continued vitality in the international art market".
 
Third and Fourth Quarter Sales
The highlight of the third quarter was the outstanding July Old Master Paintings sale in London. The sale led the market with a total of $87.7 million, near the pre-sale high estimate of $90.0 million**. The star of the sale was Canaletto's
Venice, the Grand Canal, Looking North-East from Palazzo Balbi to the Rialto Bridge
which sold for $32.6 million, more than double its pre-sale estimate of $11/14 million**.
 
Last week in New York, our Impressionists and Modern Art sales achieved very strong results. The sales totaled $172.0 million, near the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $124.4 to $173.3 million** with the evening sale surpassing its high estimate, the first time for such a sale in fifteen years. The highlight of the sale was Pablo Picasso's
Nu Jaune
, a study for his seminal work
Les Demoiselles d'Avignon
, which sold for $13.7 million, more than triple its pre-sale estimate of $3/4 million**. Half of the works of the evening sale exceeded their high estimates and 32 works brought $1 million or more.
 
Last month, our fall Hong Kong sales achieved $109.7 million, Sotheby's highest total in its 31-year history in Hong Kong. The undisputed highlight of the series was the sale of the Guyuexuan "Pheasant" vase which sold for $14.9 million, the highest price ever paid at auction in Asia for a work of art. The Chinese Works of Art sales achieved $60.8 million which was well within the pre-sale estimate of $53.6/71.9 million** and the Chinese Paintings sales totaled $31.5 million, more than double the pre-sale estimate of $11.6/16.2 million**.
 
Single owner sales have performed very successfully thus far this quarter. Early in the quarter, Sotheby's held a remarkable single owner sale of heirlooms belonging to the Royal House of Hanover which took place over nine days at the Marienburg Castle in
 
3
 
 
 
Germany. Approximately 4,800 lots brought an outstanding total of $50.2 million, more than triple its pre-sale estimate of $16+ million**.
 
Last week in New York, Sotheby's sold more than 600 lots from the magnificent collection of Lily and Edmond J. Safra. The sale achieved $49.0 million, well above its pre-sale high estimate of $37.7 million**, for its French, Continental and English Furniture, Decorative Works of Art, Clocks, Porcelain, Paintings, Carpets, Faberg and Russian Works of Art.
 
Other notable single owner sales already held this fourth quarter were the sale of a Private Chinese Porcelain Collection in Hong Kong for $14.7 million; the sale of the Library of Lord Wardington in London for $11.3 million; and the sale of property from the estate of Laurance S. Rockefeller in New York for $7.8 million.
 
Upcoming Sales
Our fall New York Contemporary sales will take place later this week and are expected to achieve $95.5 million to $132.2 million**. Highlights include a rare sculpture by David Smith entitled
Cubi XXVII
(estimated at $8/12 million**), Andy Warhol's portrait
Jackie Frieze
(estimated at $8/10 million**) and a pair of paintings by Cy Twombly,
Untitled (Rome)
and
Untitled (New York)
(estimated at $6/8 million** and $8/10 million**, respectively). Other notable works are by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Francis Bacon, Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.
 
At the end of November, our American Paintings sale in New York, estimated at $52/74 million**, will include two portraits of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, estimated at $10/15 million** and $6/8 million**, sold on behalf of the New York Public Library, as well as Grant Wood's iconic
Spring Plowing
(estimate of $3/5 million**) and John Singer Sargent's
The Rialto
(estimate of $3/4 million**).

At a meeting on February 10, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") and its Section 162(m) Subcommittee (collectively, the "Committee") approved the criteria for determining performance bonus awards under the Company's Executive Bonus Plan ("EBP") for the year ended December 31, 2006. Under these criteria, a participant in the EBP will be eligible to receive a performance bonus under the EBP only if the Company achieves a specified base level of net income for the year, as determined by the Committee, and the amount of each bonus will increase depending on the achievement by the Company of certain threshold levels of net income in excess of the base level.
 
The Committee also approved the performance criteria for determining the Company contribution to the Sotheby's, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the "Retirement Savings Plan") and the Sotheby's, Inc. 2005 Benefit Equalization Plan (the "2005 BEP") for the year ended December 31, 2006, which criteria are the same for both plans. Under these criteria, a Company contribution will be made to both plans in an amount equal to a specified percentage of participants' eligible compensation only if the Company achieves a specified base level of net income for the year, as determined by the Committee, and this percentage will increase depending on the achievement by the Company of certain threshold levels of net income in excess of the base level. The Company also makes contributions to these plans that match employee contributions, and matching contributions are paid without regard to any performance criteria.
 
At its February meeting, the Committee also approved discretionary bonuses for senior officers under the Company's cash bonus program for bonus-eligible employees. Each individual's bonus is determined, at the discretion of the Committee, based upon the achievement of both personal and Company performance objectives.

EXHIBIT 99.1
March 7, 2006, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction, private sales and art-related financing activities, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2005.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company reported fourth quarter auction and related revenues of $200.6 million, its highest fourth quarter total ever, and a $25.1 million, or 14%, increase over the prior fourth quarter, primarily due to higher auction commission revenues and private sale commissions. The Company's income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $51.7 million or $0.90 per
diluted share compared to $36.1 million or $0.57 per diluted share for the prior period, a 43% or $15.6 million improvement. This growth is largely due to the improvement in auction commission revenues, partially offset by higher direct costs of services from additional single-owner sales and increased incentive bonus costs due to improved Company performance.
In 2005, Sotheby's achieved its highest yearly total ever for revenues with $513.5 million. Auction and related revenues for the full year 2005 totaled $502.0 million, an increase of $58.9 million, or 13%, from the prior year largely due to a significant improvement in auction commission margins, attributable to the increase in buyer's premium rates in January 2005 and a favorable change in sales mix over the period. In 2004, a greater proportion of auction sales came from high-end works of art for which commission margins are traditionally lower due to the level of competition for such objects. Accordingly, auction commission margins increased from 16.4% in 2004 to 18.7% in 2005, a 14% improvement. Income from continuing operations for the full year 2005 was $63.2 million, a $0.8 million increase from the prior year. , the Company's income from continuing operations for the full year 2005 improved by $29.1 million*, or 85%, to $63.2* million and EBITDA improved by $34.3 million*, or 31%, to $143.8* million, a remarkable achievement considering the milestone events of 2004 which included the historic private sale of the Forbes Collection of Faberg and $213.1 million in Auction Sales (aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium) from the Whitney Greentree Collection.
Excluding the one-time license fee revenue received from Cendant in the first quarter of 2004 and associated expense
"2005 was our best year in fifteen years and was without question, one of Sotheby's best years ever," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. "2006 is off to an excellent start and our 2005 results significantly exceeded our successful 2004 performance, excluding the one-time licensing fee revenue of $45 million we received from Cendant in 2004*. They represent a dramatic improvement in profitability with a return on equity of 35.2% in 2005. And, very
importantly, we see the momentum continuing into 2006. We are delighted to deliver such strong results for our shareholders."
Mr. Ruprecht continued, "Sotheby's ability to attract extraordinary paintings and objects for sale last year, coupled with a strong art market, resulted in broad-based strength across a number of categories and geographic locations. Additionally, Sotheby's had the two top achievements of the auction world in 2006: the year's highest price at auction with the sale in London of Canaletto's ($32.5 million) and the world auction record price for Contemporary Art with the sale in New York of David Smith's ($23.8 million).
Venice, the Grand Canal
Cubi XXVIII
"Many other areas were particularly noteworthy in 2005. Auction results in the emerging markets of China and Russia saw worldwide sales up dramatically in those categories (by 74% and 166% respectively) and single owner sales were also extremely successful, among them Easton Neston in England, which brought $16 million, the Hanover Collection in Germany which brought $50.0 million and the Safra Collection which brought $48.9 million. Also, Sotheby's announced the launch of an exciting retail jewelry joint venture with the Steinmetz Diamond Group which brings together Steinmetz's access to the world's finest diamonds and their celebrated talents of cutting and polishing stones with Sotheby's expertise, world-renowned brand and international client base. Further extending the Sotheby's brand was the significant sales of real estate under the Sotheby's International Realty name by Cendant in 2005. This strategic alliance was formed in 2004 and Cendant has since been investing heavily, resulting in increased brand awareness to a growing pool of high net worth families and license fee revenues of $1.4 million to Sotheby's in its first full year of the venture."
Mr. Ruprecht added: "2006 has begun with great promise. Our best Impressionist and Modern and Contemporary sales ever in London and the best Old Master Paintings Sale ever in New York contributed to a significant increase in sales for the year thus far. And looking ahead, we are fortunate to have a number of exciting future consignments, among
which will be one of the major highpoints of the spring. Picasso's , one of the most important portraits of his mistress, has not been seen on the market for forty years and is estimated to bring in excess of $50 million**."
Dora Maar au Chat
Year to Date 2006 Sales
Worldwide sales to date have been exceptional, highlighted by the Impressionist and Contemporary sales in London and Old Master Paintings sales in New York. The London Impressionist and Modern Art sales led the market last month with a total of $155.9 million, up 50% from the prior year, with the evening sale recording its highest total ever for an Impressionist sale at Sotheby's London. The top lot of the sale was the rare Tahitian work by Paul Gauguin which sold for $21.6 million. Also of great interest was a group of eight paintings by Edvard Munch from the Olsen Collection which brought a combined $29.6 million and established a new record for the artist at auction.
Deux Femmes
The London Contemporary sales the same week also brought extraordinary results with the evening sale attaining the highest total ever for a London Contemporary sale at Sotheby's. The sales brought an impressive $71.0 million, up 69% from the prior year and well above the high estimate of $56.2 million**. British artists triumphed, with Lucien Freud, Francis Bacon and Sir Anthony Caro, among others realizing outstanding prices. Lucien Freud's portrait of was the top lot of the sale with $6.2 million.
Bruce Bernard (Seated)
In New York in January, the Old Masters Paintings sales totaled $74.8 million, the highest total ever for a series of Old Master Paintings sales in New York. Strong prices were garnered for works by Rembrandt, Jan van Huysum, Donatello, Willem van de Velde, Francisco Goya, William Blake, Pieter Brueghel the Younger and Bernardo Bellotto, among others. Highlights were a Dutch still-life by Jan van Huysum, , which sold for $7.3 million, and Rembrandt's which brought $4.3 million.

Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet
Also in New York, last month, Sotheby's sold the world's most expensive photograph at auction, Edward Steichen's , which sold for $2.9 million in the sale of Photographs from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The sale established a record for a Photographs auction in New York, totaling $15.0 million.
The Pond-Moonlight
Upcoming Sales
Among the many highlights of our spring season will be one of Pablo Picasso's most important portraits of his mistress and source of inspiration for almost a decade, Dora Maar. The painting, is estimated to realize in excess of $50 million**.
Dora Maar au Chat
Sotheby's May 10 sale of Contemporary Art in New York will feature a classic work by Willem de Kooning, from 1975. For some time, de Kooning focused on sculpture and drawing, but in 1975 he ended this long period of abstinence from painting and produced twenty large-scale canvases of explosive, vibrant color executed in lush, sensuous paint strokes, all in the space of six months. This particular canvas, , is estimated to sell for $6.5/8.5 million**.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          Effective as of April 1, 2006, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") and William F. Ruprecht, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, agreed on the terms of his employment for the five-year period ending March 31, 2011. This arrangement supersedes his previous employment agreement. Under the new arrangement Mr. Ruprecht's annual base salary is $700,000. Mr. Ruprecht will also be entitled to receive annual cash bonuses based on his own and the Company's performance in relation to a number of management and other objectives determined each year by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee. Mr. Ruprecht's annual target bonus will be 1.5 times his base salary, and his bonus will be subject to a cap specified in his terms of employment and is not subject to a floor or minimum payment.
          In an effort to encourage and reward the growth of the Company and the creation of shareholder value, the Company has agreed to grant Mr. Ruprecht a one time award of 300,000 shares of restricted stock that will only vest and create value for Mr. Ruprecht at the end of the third and fifth years of his employment arrangement, and only if certain objective performance and market-based criteria are satisfied. These criteria are based on either a specified compound increase in shareholder value as measured by stock price and dividends, if any, or a specified compound cumulative increase in the Company's net income. As he has in the past three years under his previous employment agreement, Mr. Ruprecht received a 2006 equity award of restricted shares of stock. This award of 78,785 restricted stock shares, which was received on March 31, 2006, had a fair market value equal to $2,050,000 on the date of grant and will vest in equal annual installments over four years. Mr. Ruprecht is no longer eligible to participate in the Company's Executive Bonus Plan, but instead, beginning in 2007, will be entitled to a restricted stock grant in each year, subject to agreed minimum and maximum levels, the value of which will be determined based on the extent to which the performance criteria for the Executive Bonus Plan have been satisfied.
          Mr. Ruprecht's employment arrangement may be terminated at any time by the Company or Mr. Ruprecht prior to the expiration of the five-year term. If Mr. Ruprecht's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by Mr. Ruprecht without Good Reason, as such terms are defined in his terms of employment, Mr. Ruprecht will be paid only accrued base salary and benefits. If the Company terminates Mr. Ruprecht's employment without Cause or he terminates his employment for Good Reason during the five-year term, he will be entitled to a diminished benefit (as compared to the terms of his prior employment agreement) that includes, among other things, (1) accrued but unpaid salary through the termination date, (2) a cash payment of $3.5 million, (3) the immediate vesting of certain shares of restricted stock held by him pursuant to a formula described in his terms of employment, and (4) health benefits for him and his family for three years following the date of his termination. Mr. Ruprecht may terminate his employment for Good Reason if, among other things, the Company fails to provide the cash compensation or equity compensation described above.
          If Mr. Ruprecht's employment is terminated under certain circumstances following a Change of Control (as defined in his terms of employment), the Company will pay him the compensation and benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been terminated by the Company without Cause, as described above, except that he will receive a $4 million cash termination payment, not a $3.5 million cash termination payment. If the Internal Revenue Service determines that any Change of Control or other payment to Mr. Ruprecht is subject to a federal excise tax, he is entitled to receive reimbursement for any such tax obligation on an after-tax basis.
          At or after expiration of the five-year term, if the Company terminates Mr. Ruprecht's employment without Cause or he decides to terminate his employment, he will receive a diminished benefit (as compared to the terms of his prior employment agreement) of, among other things, $2,000,000 in cash in exchange for a covenant not to compete with the Company for 12 months. If, on or before December 31, 2010, the Company has not offered to continue his employment for at least one year with the same base salary and bonus opportunity that he is then receiving, but without any obligation by the Company to award him any additional equity compensation, he will forfeit some unvested restricted stock grants from prior years, but will be entitled to the immediate partial vesting of certain shares of restricted stock held by him pursuant to a formula described in his terms of employment.
          The Company will file an exhibit containing Mr. Ruprecht's terms of employment with its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2006.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ITEM: Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
Item 2.03
. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
From time to time in the ordinary course of business, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") will guarantee to consignors a minimum price in connection with the sale of property at auction. The Company must perform under its auction guarantee in the event the property sells for less than the minimum price, in which event the Company must pay the difference between the sale price at auction and the amount of the auction guarantee. If the property does not sell, the amount of the auction guarantee must be paid, but the Company has the right to recover such amount through future sale of the property. Generally, the Company is entitled to a share of the excess proceeds if the property under the auction guarantee sells above a minimum price. In addition, the Company is obligated under the terms of certain guarantees to advance a portion of the guaranteed amount prior to the auction. In certain situations, the Company reduces its financial exposure under auction guarantees through auction sharing arrangements with unaffiliated partners. Partners may also assist the Company in valuing and marketing the property to be sold at auction.
 
As reported in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, as of February 28, 2006, the Company had outstanding auction guarantees totaling $99.7 million. Subsequent to that date and through the date of this filing, the Company has entered into additional auction guarantees totaling $154.1 million. Included in this amount is a significant auction guarantee entered into on April 12, 2006, which brought the Company's aggregate outstanding auction guarantees to $253.8 million, the property relating to which had a mid-estimate sales price (1) of $290.3 million. The property related to such auction guarantees is being offered at auctions during the spring and autumn of 2006. The Company's financial exposure under these auction guarantees is reduced by $9.5 million as a result of sharing arrangements with unaffiliated partners. As of April 12, 2006, $27.4 million of the guaranteed amount had been advanced by the Company.
 
Prior to April 12, 2006, the Company's highest level of aggregate outstanding auction guarantees was $165 million on September 30, 2004.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On March 31, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Company's 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the "Stock Option Plan"), the effectiveness of which was contingent upon shareholder approval of the Restricted Stock Plan, which occurred on May 8, 2006.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
As reported in the Company's Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2006, the Company has recently experienced a significant level of employee stock option exercises, when compared to prior periods.

THIS EIGHTH AMENDMENT to the Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan ("Eighth Amendment"), dated the eighth day of May, 2006, is adopted by Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (the "Corporation").
A.
                  
The Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on April 30, 1996 and approved by the shareholders of the Corporation at the Corporation's 1996 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on June 19, 1996. The Plan has been amended from time to time. Upon reincorporation of the Corporation in the State of Delaware by merger of the Corporation into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on or after May 8, 2006, the Plan shall be known as the Sotheby's 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan").
B.
                 
Pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Plan, the Corporation has the authority to amend the Plan. The Corporation desires to and does hereby amend the Plan, as hereinafter set forth, to reduce the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Options may be granted under the Plan from 14,900,000 shares to 7,944,500 shares and to make such other changes as the Corporation desires. As of April 1, 2006, 500,830 of the total 7,944,500 shares of Common Stock are available for future Option grants. The remaining 7,443,670 shares of Common Stock are already the subject of Options previously granted or exercised under the Plan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"2.8
     Common Stock
means the Class A Limited Voting Common Stock of the Corporation. Upon the reincorporation of the Corporation in the State of Delaware, Common Stock means common stock of the Delaware corporation, as successor to the Corporation, par value $0.01 per share."
 
 
"2.10    
Corporation"
means Sotheby's Holdings, Inc, a Michigan corporation, and any successor in interest to the business of the Corporation that has, by agreement, adopted the Plan."
 
 
"2.19
    
Fair Market Value
means the value of each share of Option Stock, determined for a particular date as follows:
 
(a)
         
if the Common Stock is listed or admitted for trading on any United States national securities exchange, the value of each share of Option Stock shall be the closing price per share of Common Stock on such exchange (or, if listed on more than one United States exchange, the principal said exchange) on the relevant Valuation Date hereunder;
 
(b)
         
if paragraph (a) is not applicable, the value of each share of Option Stock shall be the fair market value as determined by the Committee, in good faith and in accordance with uniform principles consistently applied, on the last day of the relevant Fiscal Year immediately preceding the relevant date hereunder, or such other date as the Committee shall select.
 
(c)

After termination of the Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for purposes of the Plan from time to time shall be only such number of shares as are issuable under then outstanding Options."
 
 
     
"
6.1
Power to Grant Options.
The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Options may be granted to any one Employee during a Fiscal Year shall be limited to 200,000 shares. For purposes of calculating the number of shares with respect to which Options have been granted to an Employee for any Fiscal Year, any shares subject to an Option that is granted and subsequently cancelled or surrendered during such Fiscal Year shall continue to be counted against the maximum number of shares which may be granted to such Employee pursuant to the Plan during such Fiscal Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent an adjustment is made to the number of shares subject to an Option to reflect a change in the corporate capitalization of the Corporation, the additional shares, if any, subject to such Option shall not be counted against the maximum number of shares for which Options may be granted to the applicable Optionee. Subject to this maximum share limitation, the Committee may grant to such Employees as the Committee may select in accordance with Article 5 hereof, Options entitling the Optionee to purchase shares of Common Stock from the Corporation in such quantity, and on such terms and subject to such conditions not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as may be established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant or pursuant to applicable resolution of the Compensation Committee."
 
 
"(c)
       
The shares with respect to which Options may be granted hereunder are shares of Common Stock of the Corporation as presently constituted, but if, and whenever, prior to the delivery by the Corporation of all of the shares which are subject to the Options or rights granted hereunder, the Corporation shall effect a subdivision or consolidation of shares or other capital readjustments, the payment of a stock dividend or other increase or reduction of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, without receiving compensation therefore in money, services or property, the number of shares subject to the Plan shall be proportionately adjusted and the number of shares with respect to which Options granted hereunder may thereafter be exercised shall:
 
(i)
           
in the event of an increase in the number of outstanding shares, be proportionately increased, and the cash
 
3
 
 
 
consideration (if any) payable per share shall be proportionately reduced; and
 
(ii)
          
in the event of a reduction in the number of outstanding shares, be proportionately reduced, and the cash consideration (if any) payable per share shall be proportionately increased.
 
(d)
         
If the Corporation merges with one or more corporations, or consolidates with one or more corporations and the Corporation shall be the surviving corporation, thereafter, upon any exercise of Options granted hereunder, the recipient shall, at no additional cost (other than the Exercise Price and any tax withholding amounts) be entitled to receive (subject to any required action by shareholders) in lieu of the number of shares as to which such Options shall then be exercisable the number and class of shares of stock or other securities to which the recipient would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the agreement of merger or consolidation, if immediately prior to such merger or consolidation the recipient had been the holder of record of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation equal to the number of shares as to which such Options shall be exercisable. A reorganization, merger or consolidation in which the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, or a liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation, shall automatically and without any further action cause any outstanding Options which have not yet become exercisable in accordance with Article 7 to terminate and be cancelled as of the effective date of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, or dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, unless the agreement of reorganization, merger or consolidation otherwise provides."

SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES 2006 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
 -    
First Quarter Revenues increase 30% to $96.0 million
    First Quarter Operating Income from Continuing Operations improves to $1.8 million from an Operating Loss of ($8.6) million in the prior period
 - 
    Sotheby's sells the world's second most expensive painting at auction, Pablo Picasso's
 - 
Dora Maar au Chat,
for $95.2 million
 
 
May 8, 2006, New York -- Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BID), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction, private sales and art-related financing activities, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2006, the Company reported revenues of $96.0 million, a $22.0 million, or 30%, increase over the prior first quarter, primarily due to higher auction commission revenues attributable to a 44% increase in Aggregate Auction Sales (aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium), as well
 
 
 
as a 49% increase in private sale commissions. Also contributing to the improvement versus the prior year is a $2.2 million, or 184%, increase in Finance revenues primarily resulting from a higher level of client loans during the period. The Company's loss from continuing operations for the first quarter was ($3.9) million, or ($0.07), per diluted share compared to ($9.7) million, or ($0.16), per diluted share for the prior period, a 60%, or $5.8 million improvement. This growth, which is largely due to the increase in revenues highlighted above, is partially offset by certain expense increases resulting from a variety of factors including: variable increases in performance based compensation and direct costs of sales, both directly related to the overall increase in revenues; the Company's strategic investments in certain growth areas of the business, especially, Asian, Russian and Contemporary Art; investment in a number of new client service initiatives; unusually high costs for litigation accruals, client goodwill gestures and authenticity claims; and inflationary increases for such things as limited salary increases, travel, and facility related costs.
 
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales in the first quarter have historically only represented approximately 9% - 13% of annual Auction Sales, and the first quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, historically, first quarter results have not been indicative of expected full year results.
 
"As seen in these excellent first quarter results, 2006 has begun very strongly," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. "Numerous collecting categories across the globe are experiencing growth, with the most important contributors to the first quarter being London's highest Impressionist and Modern Art and Contemporary Art sales in its history; historic highs for Old Master Paintings and very successful Asian sales in New York."
 
"A healthy and vibrant art market is clearly continuing into the second quarter across a broad range of categories," Mr. Ruprecht continued. "Most noteworthy thus far is the outstanding result for Picasso's
Dora Maar au Chat
, which brought $95.2 million,
 
2
 
 
 
becoming the second highest price for a painting sold at auction. This masterpiece was sold in the Impressionist series of sales which brought $248.3 million, representing Sotheby's highest total since 1990 and leading this market in New York. Also, half the lots in the evening sale sold for $1 million or more."
 
Second Quarter Sales
In addition to last week's outstanding sales of Impressionist and Modern Art in New York, other auctions have performed extremely well, particularly in the emerging markets. Last month, Sotheby's Hong Kong held a successful series of sales, selling for the first time in the spacious Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center. The sales brought a total of $108.5 million, above the low estimate of $100.6* million. Numerous records were broken, including records for a Chinese oil painting, an Imperial Chinese work of art, a Qing textile and a pink diamond at auction. Also, the Chinese Contemporary Art sale realized $17.0 million, the highest total ever at Sotheby's for such a sale.
 
Also in April, in New York, Sotheby's held an exceptional combined Russian Paintings and Works of Art sale. The sale totaled $54.4 million, surpassing its pre-sale high estimate of $46.3* million and bringing the highest total ever for a sale of Russian Art worldwide. Highlighting the sale was Nikolai Roerich's
Lao-tze
, which sold for $2.2 million, more than seven times the high estimate of $300,000* and a record for the artist at auction. Other auction records were established for Yakovlev, Bogdanov-Belsky, Anisfeld, Vereschchagin and Bogolyubov and nine lots were sold for more than $1 million each.
Upcoming Sales

Untitled XVI

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 7, 2006, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc., a Michigan corporation ("Sotheby's"), Robert C. Noortman and Arcimboldo S.A., a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, ("Arcimboldo") entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Sotheby's acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Noortman Master Paintings B.V., a company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (the "Company"), one of the world's leading dealers in Old Master Paintings. The Company is based in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Mr. Noortman is the sole shareholder of Arcimboldo and is guaranteeing the obligations of Arcimboldo under the Purchase Agreement.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Sotheby's paid initial consideration (the "Initial Consideration") in the form of 1,946,849 shares of Sotheby's Class A Limited Voting Common Stock ("Sotheby's Shares"), which, based on the closing price of Sotheby's Shares on the New York Stock Exchange of $25.30 per share on June 6, 2006, has a value of approximately $49,255,280. In addition to the Initial Consideration, Sotheby's acquired the Company subject to approximately $26 million of indebtedness consisting of a $17 million long-term non-interest bearing note payable to Arcimboldo over a period of three years and $9 million of bank debt that was repaid upon the closing of the transaction.
Arcimboldo will also receive up to an additional 486,712 Sotheby's Shares (the "Additional Consideration") if the Company achieves certain targeted performance criteria specified in the Purchase Agreement during the five years following the closing of the transaction and if Mr. Noortman continues to be employed by the Company. Based on the closing price of Sotheby's Shares on the New York Stock Exchange of $25.30 per share on June 6, 2006 the Additional Consideration has a value today of approximately $12,313,814. The Additional Consideration is being held in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement dated June 7, 2006, among the parties to the Purchase Agreement and LaSalle Bank National Association. If the Company fails to achieve a minimum level of financial performance during the five years following the closing of the transaction, up to 20% of the Initial Consideration will be transferred back to Sotheby's.
The Purchase Agreement also provides for certain restrictions on the transfer of Sotheby's Shares received by Arcimboldo. Absent certain limited exclusions, Arcimboldo may not transfer any of the Sotheby's Shares that it received as Initial Consideration for a period of two years after the closing, and may not transfer 20% of the Sotheby's Shares that it received as Initial Consideration for a period of five years after the closing.
Sotheby's, Arcimboldo and Mr. Noortman also made customary warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement, including certain post-closing business covenants of Sotheby's and certain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants of Arcimboldo and Mr. Noortman for a period of five years following closing. Mr. Noortman also entered into a seven-year employment agreement with the Company.
 
Item 2.03
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
As disclosed under Item 1.01, Sotheby's
acquired the Company subject to
approximately $26 million of indebtedness consisting of a $17 million long-term non-interest bearing note payable to Arcimboldo over a period of three years and $9 million of bank debt that was repaid upon the closing of the transaction.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities.
The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.
The Sotheby's Shares issued to Arcimboldo under the Purchase Agreement were issued pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Arcimboldo has represented that it is an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act, and that it is acquiring the Sotheby's Shares for its own account for investment and not with a view to the resale or distribution of the Sotheby's Shares. Arcimboldo has also agreed to certain transfer restrictions.

On June 30, 2006, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc., a Michigan corporation ("Sotheby's Michigan"), completed its reincorporation into the State of Delaware (the "Reincorporation"). The Reincorporation and related proposals were approved by the shareholders of Sotheby's Michigan at the annual meeting of shareholders held on May 8, 2006. The Reincorporation was completed by means of a merger of Sotheby's Michigan with and into Sotheby's Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Sotheby's Delaware") and wholly-owned subsidiary of Sotheby's Michigan incorporated for the purpose of effecting the Reincorporation, with Sotheby's Delaware being the surviving corporation. Sotheby's Delaware was renamed "Sotheby's" upon completion of the merger.
In the merger, each outstanding share of Sotheby's Michigan Class A Limited Voting Common Stock ("Sotheby's Michigan Stock") was converted into one share of Common Stock of Sotheby's Delaware ("Sotheby's Delaware Stock"). As a result, holders of Sotheby's Michigan Stock are now holders of Sotheby's Delaware Stock, and their rights as holders thereof are governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Sotheby's Delaware. For a description of the differences between the rights of holders of Sotheby's Michigan Stock and Sotheby's Delaware Stock, see "Comparison of Shareholder Rights Before and After the Reincorporation" in Sotheby's Michigan's Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 11, 2006, which description is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
The Reincorporation did not result in any change in the business or principal facilities of Sotheby's Michigan. Upon completion of the merger, the address of Sotheby's principal executive offices is 1334 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021. Sotheby's Michigan's management and board of directors continue as the management and board of directors of Sotheby's Delaware. Sotheby's Delaware Stock will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "BID." Shareholders are not required to exchange their existing stock certificates, which now represent an equivalent number of shares of Sotheby's Delaware Stock.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
As noted under Item 3.03 above, on June 30, 2006, Sotheby's Michigan completed the Reincorporation and was merged with and into Sotheby's Delaware, with Sotheby's Delaware being the surviving corporation. In the merger, Sotheby's Delaware was renamed "Sotheby's." As a result of the Reincorporation, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Sotheby's Delaware will govern the surviving corporation. For a description of the terms of Sotheby's Delaware's certificate of incorporation and By-Laws, see "Comparison of Shareholder Rights Before and After the Reincorporation" in Sotheby's Michigan's Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the Commission on April 11, 2006, which description is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Copies of Sotheby's Delaware's Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, as amended upon completion of the merger, are attached hereto as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.
Item 8.01 Other Events
In connection with the completion of the Reincorporation and by operation of Rule 12g-3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Sotheby's Delaware Stock is deemed registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and Sotheby's Delaware has succeeded to Sotheby's Michigan's attributes as the registrant with respect thereto.
On June 30, Sotheby's issued the press release filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K announcing the completion of the Reincorporation.

Guaranty. Landlord may commence any action or proceeding based upon this Guaranty directly against Guarantor without making Tenant or anyone else a party defendant in such action or proceeding. Any one or more successive and/or concurrent actions may be brought hereon against Guarantor either in the same action, if any, brought against Tenant and/or any other party or in separate actions, as often as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may deem advisable.
          4. This Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by the successors and assigns of Landlord or by any party to whom Landlord's interest in the Lease or any part thereof, including the rents, may be assigned whether by way of mortgage or otherwise. Wherever in this Guaranty reference is made to either Landlord or Tenant, the same shall be deemed to refer also to the then successor or assign of Landlord or Tenant.
          5. Guarantor hereby expressly waives and releases (a) notice of the acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any change in Tenant's financial condition; (b) the right to interpose any substantive or procedural defense of the law of guarantee, indemnification or suretyship, except the defense of prior payment or prior performance by Tenant (of the obligations which Guarantor is called upon to pay or perform under this Guaranty) or any other defense that is available and that Tenant is entitled to assert under the Lease); (c) all rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors or sureties, including without limitation, any extension of time conferred by any law now or hereafter in effect; (d) the right to trial by jury, in any action or proceeding of any kind arising on, under, out of, or by reason of or relating, in any way, to this Guaranty or the interpretation, breach or enforcement thereof; (e) the right to interpose any defense (except as allowed under (b) above), set off or counterclaim of any nature or description in any action or proceeding; and (f) any right or claim of right to cause a marshalling of Tenant's assets or to cause Landlord to proceed against Tenant and/or any collateral held by Landlord at any time or in any particular order.
          6. Without limiting Guarantor's obligations elsewhere under this Guaranty, if Tenant, or Tenant's trustee, receiver or other officer with similar powers with respect to Tenant, rejects, disaffirms or otherwise terminates the Lease pursuant to any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or any other law affecting creditors' rights generally, Guarantor shall automatically be deemed to have assumed, from and after the date such rejection, disaffirmance or other termination of the Lease is deemed effective, all obligations and liabilities of Tenant under the Lease to the same extent as if Guarantor had been originally named instead of Tenant as a party to the Lease and the Lease had never been so rejected, disaffirmed or otherwise terminated. Guarantor, upon such assumption, shall be obligated to perform and observe all of the Covenants whether theretofore accrued or thereafter accruing and Guarantor shall be subject to any rights or remedies of Landlord which may have theretofore accrued or which may thereafter accrue against Tenant on account of any default under the Lease, notwithstanding that such defaults existed prior to the date Guarantor was deemed to have automatically assumed the Lease or that such rights or remedies are unenforceable against Tenant by reason of such rejection, dissaffirmance or other termination. Guarantor shall confirm such assumption in writing at the request of Landlord upon or after such rejection, dissaffirmance or other termination, but the failure to do so shall not affect such assumption. Guarantor, upon the assumption of the Lease, shall have all of the rights of Tenant under the Lease (to the extent permitted by law). Neither Guarantor's obligation to make payment in
accordance with this Guaranty nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed, stayed, released or limited in any manner by any impairment, modification, change, release, limitation or stay of the liability of Tenant or its estate in bankruptcy or any remedy for the enforcement thereof, resulting from the operation of any present or future provision of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or other statute or from the decision of any court interpreting any of the same, and Guarantor shall be obligated under this Guaranty as if no such impairment, stay, modification, change, release or limitation had occurred.
          7.       (a) This Guaranty and all rights, obligations and liabilities arising hereunder shall be construed according to the laws of the State of New York. Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of (i) the United States Courts for the Southern District of New York, or the courts of the State of New York, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty, and Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims against it in respect of such action or proceeding against Guarantor may be heard and determined in such courts. Guarantor hereby appoints Sotheby's, Inc. as its attorney-in-fact and agent in its name, place and stead to accept service of legal process in any such action or proceeding in any court described above, and consents that service of legal process in any such action or proceeding may be made upon it by service upon Sotheby's, Inc. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Guarantor agrees that a final judgment obtained in any court described above in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
                    (b) Nothing in this shall affect the right of Landlord to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Guarantor hereby consents that service of process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to Guarantor at the address hereinabove set forth will be sufficient.

          11. If Landlord shall be obligated by reason of any bankruptcy, insolvency or other legal proceeding to pay or repay to Tenant or to Guarantor or to any trustee, receiver or other representative of either of them, any amounts previously paid by Tenant or Guarantor pursuant to the Lease or this Guaranty, Guarantor shall reimburse Landlord for any such payment or repayment and this Guaranty shall extend to the extent of such payment or repayment made by Landlord, except to the extent, if any, that such payment or repayment is prohibited by law or that such payment or repayment constitutes merely a reimbursement of any overpayment.

SOTHEBY'S ANNOUNCES 2006 SECOND
QUARTER AND FIRST HALF RESULTS
 
 
August 2, 2006, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the second quarter and first six months ended June 30, 2006.
 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the Company reported record revenues of $248.3 million, a $69.9 million, or 39%, increase from the prior period, primarily due to higher auction commission revenues attributable to a 52% increase in Aggregate Auction Sales as well as a 77% increase in private sale commissions. Also contributing to the improvement versus the prior year is an $8.4 million, or seven-fold, increase in principal activities revenues due to successful results from auction guarantees in the quarter.
 
 
 
Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2006 was an historic high of $72.4 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to $42.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share for the prior period, a $29.9 million, or 70% improvement. Adjusted EBITDA* for the second quarter of 2006 was $123.4 million, a $48.1 million, or 64%, increase from the prior year period. This growth, which is largely due to the increase in revenues highlighted above, is partially offset by certain expense increases primarily related to the overall increase in sales and profitability, a $4.2 million, or 22%, increase in direct costs and a $9.9 million increase in incentive bonus costs attributable to the strong results of the quarter.
 
For the first six months of 2006, revenues reached a record high of $344.3 million, a $91.8 million, or 36%, improvement. This rise is due to the increase in auction commission and principal activities revenues discussed above. Income from continuing operations for the first half 2006 was $68.4 million, a $35.7 million, or 109%, increase from the first half of 2005. Adjusted EBITDA* for the first half 2006 was $130.9 million, a $57.9 million, or 79%, improvement from the first half 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.14 for the first half of 2006, more than double the prior period figure of $0.51.
 
"These results represent Sotheby's best second quarter in our history," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "Once again, Sotheby's auctioned the top lot of the season and we sold 287 lots for over $1 million. We have more than doubled our first half 2006 net income and earnings per share from the prior year, which is an impressive achievement, especially considering the strength of last year's results as well as the competitive landscape."
 
"The discipline of being a public company has focused Sotheby's on running our business in the best interests of our shareholders, our clients and our employees," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "To that end, we made a conscious decision to enhance profitability by concentrating on key high end and middle market opportunities and
 
2
 
 
 
eliminating the costly high volume, lower end marginal sales. Consequently, we have intentionally halved our lot volume over the last six years. Our excellent financial performance clearly validates this strategy."
 
Second and Third Quarter Sales
The most notable contributors to our performance were the Impressionist and Modern Art, Contemporary Art, Russian Art and Asian Art fields. Certainly the highlight of the second quarter was the sale of Picasso's , which brought $95.2 million, becoming the second highest price for a painting ever sold at auction. This masterpiece was sold in the Impressionist series of sales which brought $248.3 million, representing Sotheby's highest total since 1990 and leading this market in New York.
Dora Maar au Chat
 
Sotheby's June sales in London also achieved excellent results. The Impressionist and Modern Art Sales led the market with a total of $201.8 million, at the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $149.7 to $211.3 million** and almost double last June's excellent sales total of $108.6 million. The sales brought the highest total ever for a series of auctions held in Europe, with 30 lots selling for over $1 million. The highlight of the sale was Modigliani's which sold for $30 million. The London Contemporary sales also led the market and were Sotheby's best London sales ever in this field. The sales brought $77.6 million, a 60% increase from the prior year and at the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $56.3 to $77.7 million**. Twelve new Contemporary records were set with 14 lots selling for over $1 million.
Portrait of Jeanne Hebuterne
 
Russian Paintings and Works of Art continued to show great momentum in both New York and London in the second quarter. New York's April sale totaled $54.4 million, surpassing its pre-sale high estimate of $46.3 million** and bringing the highest total ever for a sale of Russian Art worldwide. Sotheby's broke its own record one month later in London when our May sale brought $55.4 million, soundly above its pre-sale high estimate of $42.9 million**. Twenty seven auction records were achieved in the London sale with 12 lots selling for over $1 million.

Sotheby's Spring sale of American Paintings in New York led the market and brought an exceptional $60.0 million, towards the high end of its pre-sale estimate of $41.3 to $62.3 million** and a $19.6 million, or 49%, improvement from the prior year. A number of records were set with the highlight being Norman Rockwell's poignant which depicts a young soldier's return from overseas at the end of World War II (sold for $9.2 million).
Homecoming Maine
 
In London last month, Sotheby's Old Masters Paintings sales achieved $58.7 million with twenty three new auction records set and 65% of the lots sold in the evening sale exceeding their high estimates. Highlights of the sales included Pieter Brueghel the Younger's ,which was the top lot of the sales at $9.5 million, and works by Jan van Huysum, Jean-Honor Fragonard, Canaletto and Francesco Guardi.
The Procession to Cavalry
 
Also sold at Sotheby's London in July was the most important book in English Literature, the First Folio edition of Shakespeare's plays for $5.2 million. The book is now the most valuable book ever sold at auction at Sotheby's London.
 
An important piece of American history was sold at Sotheby's New York to remarkable results. On Flag Day, June 14, four battle flags that were captured during the American Revolution and returned to America after 225 years were sold. Taken as trophies of battle by one of Britain's most notorious commanders, Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, during conflicts in Bedford, New York in 1779 and at Waxsaws on the North Carolina/South Carolina border in 1780, the flags sold for an astounding $17.4 million. They were estimated to sell for $4 to $10** million.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          
On November 9, 2006, the Company issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
News Release
November 9, 2006, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2006.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported operating revenues of $57.4 million, a $0.9 million, or 2%, increase from the prior period, primarily due to higher finance segment revenues, offset by lower auction commission revenues. For the third quarter of 2006, loss from continuing operations was ($30.4) million, or ($0.49) per diluted share, compared to ($21.0) million, or ($0.35) per diluted share for the prior period, a $9.2 million decline. This deterioration in the third quarter is principally due to an $8.2 million, or 22%, increase in salaries and related costs and a $6.7 million, or 24%, rise in general and administrative costs.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales in the third quarter have historically represented only approximately 7%-10% of annual Auction Sales, and the third quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, third quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
While salaries and related expenses increased in the third quarter, it is important to note that these costs have declined from 42.2% of revenues in the first nine months of 2005 to 39.8% for the first nine months of 2006 and we expect this trend to continue for the full year. The increase in the third quarter is primarily due to higher equity compensation costs ($3.3 million) and higher full-time salaries ($3.2 million). The increase in equity compensation primarily results from compensation arrangements with key senior executives. Included in the $3.3 million increase is $1.5 million in costs associated with restricted stock awards that will only be of value to the recipients if certain objective market or performance criteria are met at the end of three to five years.
The increase in full-time salaries is due to strategic headcount additions in key areas of the Company, such as Contemporary Art, Russian Art and Asian Art, as well as limited pay increases. Also contributing to increased salaries and related costs are higher payroll taxes ($0.8 million) due to the significant amount of stock option exercises in the quarter, attributable to the recent growth in the Company's stock price, as well as increased restricted stock vestings in the quarter. Payroll taxes relating to option exercises are expected to decline; the number of stock options outstanding has decreased significantly as the Company has moved to a model where employees are rewarded with restricted stock rather than with stock options.
Sotheby's Board of Directors and Management believe that it is appropriate to compensate senior executives with restricted stock so that their performance is aligned with the performance of the Company and the interests of shareholders. Consequently, Sotheby's Board of Directors approved a new policy for senior executive stock holdings last week.
This new policy encourages senior executives to retain 50% of stock awards until a specified target number of shares is accumulated. Target ownership requirements will vary depending on position, salary and equity award participation levels and are anticipated to take four to five years for most executives to attain.
The increase in general and administrative expenses in the third quarter primarily stems from increased professional fees ($3.0 million) largely relating to an initiative for outsourcing catalogue production in Europe as well as outsourcing certain tax functions. A key goal for Management continues to be a focus on fixed costs and, where possible, globalizing certain initiatives. As such, Management expects that the catalogue outsourcing will lead to decreased costs in the future, similar to our experience in our North American business. Also contributing to the rise in general and administrative expenses are higher travel and entertainment costs ($1.4 million), attributable to increased business volume in the fall selling season as well as an increase in underlying airline and hotel costs, and increased premises rental and maintenance costs ($0.8 million).
For the first nine months of 2006, operating revenues are $401.7 million, a $92.8 million, or 30%, improvement. This is largely due to increased auction commission and principal activities revenues over the period. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2006 was $38.0 million, a $26.5 million, or 229%, increase from the prior period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.62 for the first nine months of 2006, more than three times the prior period figure of $0.18.
"As the 73% increase in our fourth quarter Impressionist and Modern results and the 39% increase in our year to date sales make clear, the art market is extremely vibrant and we certainly expect a strong market and sales for the remainder of the year," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "Our responsibility at this time is to balance strategic investment spending, which takes advantage of the current robust environment, while continuing a rigorous focus on costs.

On December 7, 2006, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sotheby's (the "Company"), adopted the Sotheby's Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), effective January 1, 2007. The Plan replaces the Company's existing non-qualified Benefit Equalization Plan (the "BEP") (an unfunded deferred compensation plan that is available to senior officers of the Company in the United States) with a plan that incorporates best practice features of contemporary non-qualified plans, at minimal extra cost to the Company. Participants in the Plan will be able to defer a greater proportion of eligible compensation as compared to the BEP and will be provided with more flexible distribution options. Specifically, the Plan allows eligible employees to defer up to 80% of base salary and up to 100% of incentive compensation; non-employee Directors will be allowed to defer up to 100% of the cash portion of Directors' fees. As with the BEP, the employer matching and profit sharing contribution levels will be identical to those in the Company's qualified 401(k) plan. The Plan will provide a broad menu of investment crediting options; whereas BEP balances are credited at a fixed rate of 3.3% above the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate.
     
Employee deferrals and employer contributions will be informally funded into a rabbi trust via investments in corporate-owned life insurance, as well as taxable investments. Existing unfunded BEP balances, which totaled $23.4 million as of October 31, 2006, will be transferred into the Plan on January 1, 2007. The Company intends to fund this amount into the rabbi trust in the near future.

Major factors which the Company believes could cause the actual results to differ materially from the predicted results in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the factors listed in the Company's Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2006 under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," which are not ranked in any particular order.

SOTHEBY'S ANNOUNCES 2006 FOURTH
QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS
 
 
March 1, 2007, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction, private sales, dealer and art-related financing activities, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, the Company reported record revenues of $263.1 million, a $58.2 million, or 28%, increase over the prior period, primarily due to higher auction commission revenues and revenues from principal activities. The Company's income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 was a record $69.3 million, or $1.08 per diluted share compared to $51.7 million, or $0.90 per diluted share for the prior period, a 34%, or $17.7 million improvement, largely due to growth in
 
auction commission revenues. This is partially offset by a $9.0 million, or 16%, increase in salaries and related costs, due to higher full time salaries as well as higher incentive bonus costs attributable to the strong results for the period. Also, general and administrative expenses rose $11.2 million, or 38%, partially due to increased professional fees relating to an initiative for outsourcing catalogue production in Europe, outsourcing of professional tax services as well as consulting fees for strategic corporate initiatives.
 
In 2006, Sotheby's achieved its highest annual total ever for revenues, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA* in its 263-year history. Total revenues in 2006 were $664.8 million which is $151.0 million, or 29%, better than in 2005 largely due to a $109.9 million, or 25%, improvement in auction commission revenues. This is attributable to a 36% increase in Auction Sales (aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium) which rose to $3.75 billion, Sotheby's highest ever. Operating income of $197.2 million, was $73.9 million, or 60% ahead of prior year. Income from continuing operations for the full year 2006 totaled $107.4 million, a $44.1 million, or 70%, increase from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA* also dramatically improved by $73.2 million, or 51%, to $218.4 million. These strong results are due to the revenue increases mentioned above and are partially offset by a 21% rise in salaries and related costs mainly stemming from higher incentive bonus costs as a result of the strong financial performance for the year as well as increased full time salaries and stock compensation expense over the period. Also, general and administrative expenses increased by 20% partly due to a 33% increase in professional fees partially resulting from the catalogue outsourcing, tax outsourcing and consulting fees for strategic corporate initiatives mentioned previously.
 
"By virtually every measure, 2006 was Sotheby's best year ever and 2007 is off to an outstanding start," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "A 70% increase in income from continuing operations and a return on equity of 50%, along with the resumption of our dividend after a six-year hiatus, are clear indications of our continued improvement in profitability."
 
 
Many areas were particularly noteworthy in 2006. Traditional categories such as Impressionist and Modern Art, consistently Sotheby's largest department, increased by 79% in Auction Sales to a total of $932.4 million. Sales of Contemporary Art were up by 61% to $647.0 million. Emerging markets performed strongly. Russian Paintings and Works of Art brought $152.4 million, an 80% increase from the prior year. Sales in Asia totaled $284.0 million, a 29% increase from the prior year and 151% growth from three years ago, and worldwide sales of Contemporary Asian Art brought $70.2 million, 391% above sales in the prior year.
 
"An important contributor to our success over the past couple of years has been our focus on the high end of the art market and this reaped many successes in 2006," said Mr. Ruprecht. "Sotheby's sold the most expensive painting at auction last year, Picasso's
Dora Maar au Chat
, which sold for $95.3 million, and also sold 20 works above $10 million, a record for us. That emphasis will continue going forward. Whether in person, on the phone or online, Sotheby's will offer the best auction experience anywhere for our clients around the world.
 
"To that end, we are making significant changes to our business, globally reorganizing how we manage client relationships, and in the process, adding significant tools and staff in those areas our important clients value most. Client relationships are a key driver to success and we know that our clients live and do business in many locations around the world. We also understand that our clients want a 24/7 experience with us, with constant access to account information and we know that our clients expect a consistently high level of service from us. We will fulfill these expectations.
 
"This spring we will launch "
mySothebys
", a major enhancement to our website that will revolutionize the auction experience for our clients. It will enable clients to obtain 24/7 online services and account information and have access to exciting new features such as paddle pre-registration, instant magnification of lot images, a tracked lot list and immediate
 
 
real time auction results. Additionally, we will further build on our already sophisticated rich media experiences of video and podcasting by introducing streaming video of our evening sales this May. And we plan to take online real time bidding, which we introduced several years ago, to a whole new level of sophistication later this year.
 
"We have also looked carefully at new and existing markets to see where we should devote more resources. To respond to promising global opportunities, we are opening offices in Moscow and Beijing and are establishing a greater presence in the Middle East, where we have been operating for many years, so that we can better serve this increasingly important part of the global art world."
 
In line with our strategy to focus on our major clients, we have made the decision to refocus our business portfolio. This decision, which will be guided by local statutory consultation guidelines, will result in the discontinuation of auctions at the Olympia sales center in London which traditionally has processed sales at a much lower price point than the rest of the Company. In addition, there will also be staff reductions in lower end sales categories in New York, Amsterdam and Milan. We expect this decision to reduce our headcount by approximately five percent globally and may result in a first quarter charge in the range of $2 million for severance costs.
 
Year to Date 2007 Sales
Worldwide sales to date in 2007 have been extremely strong. In New York, the Old Masters Paintings sale in January totaled $111.0 million, an increase of 59% compared to the prior year and the highest worldwide total ever for an Old Master Paintings sale. The two top lots were both by Rembrandt:
Portrait of
St. James the Greater
brought $25.8 million and
Portrait of Young Woman with Black Cap
brought $9.0 million, more than double its high estimate of $4 million**. Other strong prices were brought by Francesco Guardi, Joseph Wright of Derby, Sandro Botticelli and El Greco.

The sales brought $124.2 million, up 75% from the prior year and well above the high estimate of $106.3 million**.

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
        From time to time in the ordinary course of business, Sotheby's (the "Company") will guarantee to consignors a minimum price in connection with the sale of property at auction. The Company must perform under its auction guarantee in the event the property sells for less than the minimum price, in which event the Company must pay the difference between the sale price at auction and the amount of the auction guarantee. If the property does not sell, the amount of the auction guarantee must be paid, but the Company has the right to recover such amount through future sale of the property. In certain of these instances, the sale proceeds ultimately realized by the Company exceed the amount of any prior losses recognized on the auction guarantee. Additionally, the Company is generally entitled to a share of the excess proceeds if the property under the auction guarantee sells above a minimum price. The Company is obligated under the terms of certain guarantees to advance a portion of the guaranteed amount prior to the auction. In certain situations, the Company reduces its financial exposure under auction guarantees through auction sharing arrangements with unaffiliated partners. Partners may also assist the Company in valuing and marketing the property to be sold at auction.
        As reported in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, as of February 20, 2007, the Company had outstanding auction guarantees totaling $83.2 million. Subsequent to that date and through the date of this filing, the Company has entered into additional auction guarantees totaling $209.9 million. Included in this amount are a number of recent significant auction guarantees, which brought the Company's aggregate outstanding auction guarantees to $293.1 million, the property relating to which had a mid-estimate sales price (1) of $324.1 million. The property related to such auction guarantees is being offered at auctions principally during the spring of 2007. As of March 29, 2007, $25.6 million of the guaranteed amount had been advanced by the Company.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

All Performance Bonuses shall be made conditional upon the Participant's acknowledgement, by acceptance of a Performance Bonus, that all decisions and determinations of the Committee shall be final and binding on the Participant, his or her beneficiaries and any other person having or claiming an interest under such Performance Bonus. Performance Bonuses need not be uniform among Participants. The Committee's administration of the Plan, including all such rules and regulations, interpretations, selections, determinations, approvals, decisions, delegations, amendments, terminations and other actions, shall be final and binding on the Corporation and all employees of the Corporation, including, the Participants and their respective beneficiaries.
Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law (including, but not limited to, Code Section 162(m)) or the applicable rules of a stock exchange, the Committee may delegate, on such terms and conditions as it determines in its sole and absolute discretion, to one or more senior executives of the Corporation, any of the powers herein provided or conferred, or designate one or more senior executives to perform those matters to be performed by the Committee, including administration of the Plan; provided, however, that only the Committee shall have the authority to amend or terminate the Plan. Any person or persons delegated or designated by the Committee shall be subject to the same obligations and requirements imposed on the Committee and its members under the Plan. Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time.
4.3
Delegation by Committee.
The Corporation shall pay all costs and expenses of administering the Plan.
4.4
Expenses of Administration.
Each member of the Committee shall be entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to him by any officer or other employee of the Corporation or any of its affiliates, the Corporation's independent certified public accountants or any executive compensation consultant, legal counsel or other professional retained by the Corporation to assist in the administration of the Plan. The Committee, members of the Committee, and each officer or employee of the Corporation designated or delegated by the Committee or acting on
4.5
Indemnification.
behalf of the Committee, shall be indemnified and protected by the Corporation for any action or any failure to act in connection with services performed by or on behalf of the Committee to the fullest extent provided or permitted by the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and any other applicable legally binding document and by any insurance policy or other agreement intended for the benefit of the Committee as a committee of the Board of Directors or otherwise, or by any applicable law.
For a given Performance Period, the Committee, upon recommendation from the Corporation's management, shall, within the Applicable Period, determine the Employees who shall be Participants during that Performance Period, each Participant's Target Performance Bonus and the Performance Goals for each Participant, all of which shall be set forth in writing. The Performance Goals may provide for differing amounts to be paid based on differing thresholds of performance. The Committee shall specify in the minutes what adjustments under Section 5.5, if any, shall be made to the financial calculations used to determine the achievement of Performance Goals. The Committee shall notify each Participant of the applicable Performance Goals and other terms of Target Performance Bonuses for the Performance Period.
5.1
Establishment of Performance Goals.
Generally, a Participant earns a Performance Bonus based on the level of achievement of the Performance Goals established by the Committee for that Performance Period; provided that the Committee may reduce a Performance Bonus based upon its assessment of performance or other factors, but not increase the Performance Bonus beyond the amount determined based on achievement of the Performance Goals. No Performance Bonuses will be paid out with respect to any Performance Period in which the minimum level of the Performance Goals established by the Committee has not been achieved. Upon satisfaction of the designated Performance Goals for any Performance Period, Performance Bonus amounts will be based on a multiple of the Participant's Target Annual Incentive Bonus.
5.2
Determination of Performance Bonus.
The maximum Performance Bonus payable to any Participant for any Performance Period shall not exceed $3,000,000.
5.3
Maximum Award Amount.
It is the intent of the Corporation that Performance Bonuses payable to Participants under the Plan who are "covered employees" within the meaning of Treasury regulation section 1.162-27(c)(2) (as amended from time to time) shall constitute "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and Treasury regulation section 1.162-27(e) (as amended from time to time). Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the Performance Bonuses shall be based on Performance Goals for each Performance Period that shall satisfy the requirements for "qualified performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), including the requirement that the achievement of the Performance Goals be substantially uncertain at the time they are established and that the Performance Goals be established in such a way that a third party with knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether and to what extent the Performance Goals have been met. Performance Bonuses may not be awarded as an alternative to any other award that is not designated as "qualified performance-based compensation" but instead must be separate and apart from all other awards made. The Committee is authorized to reduce the Performance Bonus for any Performance Period based upon its assessment of performance or other factors, but not to increase the Performance Bonus beyond the amount determined based on achievement of the Performance Goals. Any reduction of a Participant's Performance Bonus shall not result in an increase in any other Participant's Performance Bonus.
5.4
Code Section 162(m).
The Committee may at any time prior to the final determination of the Performance Bonuses change the Target Performance Bonus of any Participant or the Performance Goals applicable to such Participant to reflect any change in the Participant's responsibility level or position during the course of the Performance Period; provided, however, the
5.5
Changes to the Target.
Committee may only make such changes with respect to a Performance Bonus to the extent such changes will not adversely affect the Performance Bonus from qualifying as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m).
To the extent applicable, the determination of achievement of Performance Goals set under the Plan for any given Performance Period shall be determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and in a manner consistent with the methods used in the Corporation's audited financial statements, and, unless the Committee decides otherwise within the Applicable Period, without regard to (i) extraordinary items or discontinued operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, (ii) gains or losses from the sale of significant assets or Business Units, (iii) changes in accounting rules or principles, (iv) any non-recurring impairment or restructuring charges, or (v) any unusual adjustment to tax valuation allowances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be considered as preventing the Committee from making adjustments to the Performance Goals or to an individual Performance Bonus to reflect unusual or non-recurring events, to the extent that such adjustments will not adversely affect the Performance Bonus from qualifying as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m).
5.6
Impact of Extraordinary Items or Changes in Accounting.
A Participant must be employed both on the last day of the Performance Period and the date upon which the Performance Bonus is paid in order to earn a Performance Bonus for that Performance Period, except as provided in Section 6.5 in the event of a Participant's death; provided, however, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may decide to make a prorated payment to a Participant who is not employed on the date(s) referenced in the preceding sentence, based on the number of days that the Participant was actively employed and performed services during such Performance Period in such circumstances as are deemed appropriate. If a Participant is on an authorized leave of absence during the Performance Period, the Participant may be eligible to receive a pro-rated portion of any Performance Bonus that would otherwise have been earned, as determined by the Committee.
6.1
Termination of Employment Prior to the Bonus Payment Date.
A Participant's Performance Bonus shall be payable in accordance with this Section 6.2. The Committee shall certify in writing, in a manner conforming to applicable regulations under Code Section 162(m), prior to payment of each Performance Bonus, that the Performance Goals have been satisfied. Performance Bonuses shall be payable in cash, as an award of Restricted Stock if permitted under the Restricted Stock Plan, or as a combination of cash and Restricted Stock. Performance Bonuses shall be paid as soon as practicable following the close of the Performance Period, but in any event no later than the March 15th following the end of the Performance Period for which the Performance Bonus was earned, or such later date as the Committee may determine in accordance with Code Section 409A. The number of shares of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Section 6.2, if any, shall be calculated in accordance with Section 6.3.
6.2
Time, Form and Manner of Payment.
6.3
Restricted Stock Award.
The number of shares of Restricted Stock granted, if any, as payment for the Participant's Performance Bonus under the Plan shall be calculated as follows:
(a) Calculation.
For purposes of this calculation, the Date of Grant shall be the date the Committee approves the Performances Bonuses payable to Plan Participants for the applicable
Performance Period. The Per Share Price of the Corporation's Common Stock means the closing price per share of the Corporation's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or, if listed on more than one United States exchange, the principal said exchange) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Date of Grant of the Restricted Stock. If the calculation results in fractional shares, the total will be rounded up to the nearest whole share.
Unless the Committee decides, in its sole discretion, on a longer vesting schedule, any Restricted Stock payable with respect to a Performance Bonus shall vest in accordance with the following schedule:
(b)
Vesting of Restricted Stock.
If a Participant terminates employment prior to 100% vesting, any shares of Restricted Stock which are not vested shall be forfeited immediately and permanently. A Participant shall be 100% vested in his Restricted Stock in the event he terminates employment by reason of death, Disability, or Retirement, or in the event of a Change in Control (as such terms are defined in the Restricted Stock Plan). If the vesting percentage results in fractional shares, the vested amount will be rounded up to the nearest whole share.
Except as provided with respect to the vesting schedule determined in accordance with Section 6.3(b) above, the Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Plan.
(c)
Restricted Stock Plan.
To the extent required by the law in effect at the relevant time, the Corporation shall withhold from payments made under the Plan any taxes required to be withheld pursuant to the requirements of federal or any state or local law. The Corporation may require that the Participant or his personal representative pay to the Corporation the amount of any federal, state or local taxes that the Corporation is required to withhold with respect to such Performance Bonuses, or the Corporation may deduct from other wages paid by the Corporation the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such Performance Bonuses.
6.4
Withholding; Payroll Taxes.
In the event a Participant dies subsequent to the end of a Performance Period but prior to the date a Performance Bonus for such Performance Period is paid, the Corporation shall make payment of the amount otherwise due to Participant to the Participant's Beneficiary. The Beneficiary of each Participant shall be the Beneficiary designated by such Participant under the Sotheby's, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan who shall be entitled to receive the amount, if any, payable under the Plan upon the Participant's death. However, a Participant may designate a Beneficiary different from his or her Beneficiary under the Sotheby's, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan by filing with the Corporation a written designation of one or more persons as his Beneficiary. For purposes of the Plan, a Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his Beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior Beneficiary by filing a new designation with the Corporation. The last such designation received by the Corporation shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Corporation prior to the Participant's death, and in no event shall it be effective as of any date prior to such receipt.
6.5
Payment to Beneficiary or Guardian.
The cash amount of any Performance Bonus paid or payable under the Plan shall be included in the Participant's compensation for purposes of calculating any amount or benefit the Participant is eligible to receive under the Sotheby's Deferred Compensation Plan and the Sotheby's, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan. The Performance Bonus shall not be included for purposes of the Sotheby's, Inc. Severance Plan, other compensatory or fringe benefit programs, life insurance programs, or any other similar or subsequently established plan or program.
6.6
Impact of Performance Bonus on Corporation's Other Benefit Plans or Programs.
The Plan may be amended in whole or in part at any time by action of the Committee; provided, however that the Committee shall not amend the Plan without shareholder approval if such approval is required by Code Section 162(m). Except as provided in section 8.8 below, no amendment that adversely affects any Participant's rights to a Performance Bonus that has been earned prior to the date of the amendment shall be effective unless the Participant consents to the amendment.
7.1
Amendment.
The Committee may at any time terminate this Plan. In the case of termination of the Plan, each Participant may receive a pro-rated portion of the Performance Bonus that would otherwise have been earned for the then current Performance Period had the Plan not been terminated, as determined by the Committee. Each such Performance Bonus shall be paid as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 2 1/2 months after the Performance Period in which the Plan terminates.
7.2
Right to Terminate.
Each Participant and his or her Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable right, interest or claim in any specific property or asset of the Corporation. Assets of the Corporation shall not be held under any trust for the benefit of any Participant or his or her Beneficiaries, heirs, successors or assigns, or held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of the Corporation under this Plan. Any and all of the Corporation's assets shall be, and remain, the general unrestricted assets of the Corporation. The Corporation's sole obligation under this Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Corporation to pay money in the future, subject to the conditions and provisions hereof.
8.1
Status of Each Participant is that of an Unsecured General Creditor.
Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the above, if a Participant or his Beneficiary becomes entitled to a distribution of benefits under the Plan, and if at such time the Participant has outstanding any debt, obligation, or other liability representing an amount owing to the Corporation, then the Corporation may offset such amount owed to it against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made by the Corporation in its sole discretion.
8.2
Nonassignability.
The terms and conditions of this Plan do not constitute a contract of employment between the Corporation and any Employee or Participant.

EX-10.2
The Sotheby's 1998 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (previously amended and restated effective May 5, 2005) is hereby amended and restated effective May 7, 2007, the date of the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, having been previously approved by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation ("Sotheby's"), which assumed this Plan in 2006 pursuant to a merger with Sotheby's Holdings, Inc., a Michigan corporation, that originally adopted the Plan. The Plan shall remain in effect until terminated or abandoned by action of the Board.
1. Adoption and Term.
The purpose of the Plan is to promote the long term growth and success of the Company by attracting, motivating and retaining non-employee directors of outstanding ability and to promote a greater identity of interest between the Company's non-employee directors and its shareholders. The Plan covers stock compensation only and does not include other amounts receivable by non-employee directors, such as the cash portion of the annual retainer, fees for attending meetings and reimbursement of expenses.
2. Purpose of the Plan.
The Plan requires no discretionary action by any administrative body with regard to any transaction under the Plan. To the extent, if any, that questions of administration arise, these shall be resolved by the Board. The Board may, in its discretion, delegate to the Chief Financial Officer or other officer of the Company any or all authority and responsibility to act pursuant to the Plan. The determination of the Board on all matters within its authority relating to the Plan shall be conclusive. The Board shall not be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Board, the Chief Financial Officer and any other party to whom the Board has delegated its authority pursuant to this Section 3 from all losses and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from the assertion or judicial determination of such liability.
3. Administration.
. The shares to be issued under this Plan shall be shares of the Company's authorized but unissued Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Common Stock"). Subject to adjustment for share subdivision, consolidation, or other capital readjustment, the aggregate number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the Plan is 300,000 shares of Common Stock.
4. Shares Subject to the Plan
Each non-employee director ("Eligible Director") shall receive, as the equity portion of his or her annual retainer, an amount equal to $35,000 payable in shares of the Company's Common Stock ("Director Stock"). The Director Stock shall be paid on a quarterly basis for services rendered from the date of the Annual Meeting to the date of the following Annual Meeting (the "Annual Period"). If an Eligible Director serves for less than the Annual Period, the annual retainer and the number of shares of Director Stock payable to such Eligible Director shall be prorated accordingly. For purposes of determining the number of shares of Director Stock payable each quarter pursuant to this Section 5, each quarterly sum of $8,750 ($35,000[
5. Stock Compensation.
]4) shall be divided by the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock (as defined in Section 9) on the business day immediately prior to the regular quarterly issuance date of the Director Stock. Cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional shares.
An Eligible Director may elect to defer the receipt of all or a portion of the Director Stock by making an election pursuant to Section 7, in which case there shall be credited to the Eligible Director's Stock Unit Account (as defined in Section 8) a number of units equal to the number of shares of Director Stock being deferred.
6. Deferral of Director Stock.
Prior to the calendar year in which the Director Stock is earned or, with respect to newly elected Eligible Directors, within 30 days of such election, an Eligible Director may elect to defer (the "Deferral Election") part or all of the shares of Director Stock by submitting a deferral election form (the "Deferral Election Form") to the Chief Financial Officer, indicating the
7. Election to Defer.
percentage of shares of Director Stock to be deferred (the "Deferred Amount"). Any Deferral Election (i) shall be in writing, (ii) shall be effective only with respect to Director Stock which is earned in the calendar year after the Deferral Election Form is received by the Chief Fnancial Officer, and (iii) may not be revoked or changed during the calendar year with respect to which a Deferral Election has been made. The Deferral Election shall be made in accordance with procedures established by the Company and shall continue to apply for future calendar years until superseded by a new election as provided below. A Deferral Election may be superseded with respect to Director Stock earned for any subsequent calendar year by submitting a new Deferral Election Form to the Chief Fnancial Officer prior to the beginning of such calendar year; provided, however, that (i) no revocation shall be effective to make any change with respect to Deferred Amounts previously deferred; and (ii) any such Deferral Election shall be irrevocable during the calendar year with respect to which the Deferral Election has been made.
An Eligible Director who defers the receipt of Director Stock shall have credited to an account (the "Stock Unit Account") a number of units (the "Stock Units") equal to the number of shares of Director Stock being deferred. The Deferred Amount shall be credited as of the date on which the Eligible Director becomes entitled to payment of the Deferred Amount in accordance with Section 5. Stock Units shall have no voting rights.
8. Stock Unit Account.
If Stock Units exist in an Eligible Director's Stock Unit Account on a dividend record date for the Company's Common Stock, the Stock Unit Account shall be credited, on the dividend payment date related to such dividend record date, with an additional number of Stock Units equal to (i) the cash dividend paid on one share of Common Stock, multiplied by (ii) the number of Stock Units in the Stock Unit Account on the dividend record date, divided by (iii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the dividend payment date. "Fair Market Value" means the closing price per share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day before the relevant dividend payment date.
9. Stock Units Credited With Dividends.
All amounts credited to an Eligible Director's Stock Unit Account shall be distributed on the first day of the calendar month following the date of the Eligible Director's termination of service on the Company's Board for any reason. All distributions from the Stock Unit Account shall be made in a lump sum payment, and shall be in the form of a certificate for the number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the number of whole Stock Units to be distributed and cash in lieu of any fractionalshare (determined by using the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date on which such distributions are distributed, but if such date is not a business day, then on the next preceding business day).
10. Distributions.
An Eligible Director may designate, on the Deferral Election Form, one or more beneficiaries to receive a distribution of the Eligible Director's Stock Unit Account under the Plan upon the Eligible Director's death, An Eligible Director may change his or her beneficiary designation at any time by submitting a new Deferral Election Form to the Company. If there is no designated beneficiary or no designated beneficiary surviving at the Eligible Director's death, the Eligible Director's Stock Unit Account shall be paid to the Eligible Director's estate.
11. Designation of Beneficiary.
Transactions under this Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in all events the Plan shall be construed in accordance with Rule 16b-3. To the extent any provision of the Plan or action by the Board fails to so comply, it shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board.
12. Compliance with Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act.
Each Eligible Director shall be provided a copy of the Plan, and, each Eligible Director who makes a Deferral Election shall receive, not less frequently than annually, a statement reflecting the amounts credited to the Eligible Director's Stock Unit Account.

SOTHEBY'S, a Delaware corporation

EX-99.1
May 7, 2007, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID), the parent company of Sotheby's worldwide auction, private sales, dealer and art-related financing activities, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2007, the Company reported revenues of $147.4 million, a $51.4 million, or 54%, increase over the prior first quarter, primarily due to higher auction commission revenues largely attributable to a 52% increase in Aggregate Auction Sales (aggregate hammer price of property sold at auction, including buyer's premium). Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, the first quarter has traditionally been a loss period for the Company. However, for the first quarter of 2007, the Company is reporting its highest income from continuing operations with a profitable $24.3 million, or $0.37, per diluted share compared to a loss of ($3.9) million, or ($0.07), per diluted share for the prior period, a $28.3 million improvement. This growth, which is largely
due to the increased auction commission revenues highlighted above, is partially offset by certain expense increases. Salaries and related costs increased $10.8 million, or 25%. Excluding a $2.6 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations, salaries and related costs increased $8.2 million*, or 19%*, primarily due to higher full-time salaries (attributable to strategic headcount additions in key areas of the Company after the first quarter of 2006 and limited annual salary increases) and higher equity compensation costs (resulting from compensation arrangements initiated in 2006 with key senior executives and restricted stock awarded in February, 2007). General and administrative expenses increased $6.5 million, or 20%. Excluding a $1.3 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations, general and administrative expenses increased $5.2 million*, or 16%*, partially due to increased professional fees ($4.2 million) relating to an initiative for outsourcing catalogue production in Europe and the outsourcing of professional tax services, as well as increased travel and entertainment costs ($1 million) due to increased business volume for securing consignments for the spring sales.
The Company's results for the first quarter of 2007 were significantly impacted by a onetime benefit of $20 million related to an insurance recovery from the key man life insurance policy covering Robert Noortman, who died unexpectedly in January 2007 and a $4.8 million gain on the sale of our former Billingshurst salesroom property in the United Kingdom, partially offset by a $15 million impairment charge related to intangible assets and goodwill of Noortman Master Paintings, B.V. Excluding these items, income from continuing operations would have been $16.0 million*, or $0.25* per diluted share, a $19.9 million* improvement from the first quarter of 2006.
"2007 is off to a tremendous start as evidenced by these outstanding first quarter results," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "A number of collecting categories across the world are experiencing growth, with the most important contributors to the first quarter being London's best Impressionist and Modern Art and Contemporary Art sales ever; historic highs for Old Master Paintings and record Asia week sales in New York." Mr. Ruprecht continued, "A healthy and vibrant art market is
clearly continuing into the second quarter with strong Russian sales in New York and Asian sales in Hong Kong, and we look forward to our sales of Impressionist and Modern Art and Contemporary Art this week and next in New York."
In addition to these excellent results, we have been focusing our attention on a number of important Corporate initiatives. This spring, we are launching "mySothebys", a major enhancement to our website that will revolutionize the auction experience for our clients with 24/7 access to online services and account information. We have also recently announced the launch of a Sotheby's branded Mastercard in partnership with GE Money which will provide unprecedented access to the world of art and fine living through an unmatched benefits program.
In addition, we recently opened an office in Beijing and later this month we will be opening an office in Moscow and are establishing a greater presence in the Middle East, so that we can better serve our clients in these increasingly important parts of the global art world. And in line with our strategy to focus on our major clients, we made the decision to refocus our business portfolio and concentrate our efforts on selling lots valued at $5,000 or more, as lots under $5,000 accounted for 47% of the lot volume we sold in 2006 but only 2.5% of net sales.
Second Quarter Sales
Last month, Sotheby's Hong Kong held a very successful series of sales which totaled $134.4 million, near the high end of its pre-sale estimate of $114/149 million**. A number of extraordinary results were achieved, the most notable being the record for any Chinese painting at auction set by Xu Beihong's
Put Down Your Whip

Bi
which sold for
$4.4 million, both from the Qianlong period and both achieving results above their pre-sale estimates of $5.1 million** and $1.9 million**, respectively.
 
Also in April, in New York, Sotheby's held an exceptional combined Russian Paintings and Works of Art sale. The sale totaled $51.0 million, just above its pre-sale high estimate of $50.1 million**. Highlighting the paintings offerings was Mikhail Nesterov's
Vision of St. Sergius When a Child
which brought $4.2 million, a record for the artist at auction. In the decorative arts, the top lot was a Highly Important and Rare Faberg Gold and Enamel Miniature Empire-Style Armchair, which sold for $2.3 million. Nine works sold for $1 million or more and auction records were set by eight artists.
Upcoming Sales
Beginning tomorrow night, Sotheby's New York sales of Impressionist and Modern Art have a number of highlights, with nine lots having estimates of $10 million or more. Among them are Henri Matisse's
Odalisque Grise et Jaune
of Henriette Darricarrre, one of Matisse's favorite models when he was living in Nice in the 1920s. The painting is estimated to bring $15/20 million**. Pablo Picasso's
Tte d'arlequin
which is from his Rose period and one of Picasso's most prolific character subjects is also on offer for $14/18 million*. Other highlights are Paul Czanne's
Nature Morte au Melon Vert
and Amedeo Modigliani's
Jeune Fille en Bleu
which are estimated to garner $14/18 million** and $12/15 million**, respectively. The sales are estimated to achieve a total of $265/361 million**.
Our Contemporary Art sales begin next Tuesday in New York. The evening sale will feature Mark Rothko's
White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose)
from the Collection of David and Peggy Rockefeller who purchased the painting in 1960 from its original owner. It is one of the most important Rothko's still in private hands and the first fully-realized painting of Rothko's mature style. The painting is estimated to bring in excess of $40 million**. Also on offer is Francis Bacon's
Study from Innocent X
which comes from a series of paintings based on Spanish artist Diego Velzquez's
Portrait of Pope Innocent X
, 1650, the most important of Bacon's works. The painting, which also has never before appeared at auction, is estimated to achieve in excess of $30
million**. Other highlights are Jackson Pollack's drip paintings
Number 16, 1949
and
Rythmical Dance
which are estimated to sell for $18/25 million** and $12/16 million**, respectively. The entire sales are estimated to realize $251/341 million** with six paintings estimated at $10 million** or more.
Also in New York in May, our American Paintings sale on May 23
rd
has a number of highlights by artists including Albert Bierstadt, Norman Rockwell, John Singer Sargent and Francis Silva. The entire sale is estimated to achieve $32/47 million**.
In London in July, a remarkable collection of 14 watercolours by Britain's greatest watercolourist, J.M.W. Turner, are estimated to bring $20/30 million**. From the collection of Baron Guy Ullens, a Belgian collector who spent over twenty years putting together this series of works that span the first half of the 19
th
century, the watercolours are made up of beautiful British coastal scenes as well as impressionist views of Switzerland, Germany, France and Italy.

August 8, 2007, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2007, the Company reported record revenues of $339.5 million, a $91.2 million, or 37%, increase from the prior period, primarily due to a 43% increase in Consolidated Sales
1
to $2.3 billion which includes a 45% increase in private sales to $172.6 million. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2007 was an historic high of $107.3 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared to $72.4 million, or $1.17 per diluted share for the prior period, a $35.0 million, or 48% improvement. Adjusted EBITDA
2
for the second quarter of 2007 was $164.5 million, a $41.1 million, or 33%, increase from the prior year period. This growth, which is largely due to the increase in revenues highlighted above, is partially offset by certain expense
increases, which include the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations of $5.7 million. Salaries and related costs increased $14.8 million, or 21%, largely due to higher full-time salaries (attributable to strategic headcount additions in key areas of the Company after the second quarter of 2006 and limited annual salary increases) and higher equity compensation costs (resulting from restricted stock awarded in February 2007 as well as compensation arrangements initiated with key senior executives in the second and third quarters of 2006). General and administrative expenses increased $13.1 million, or 42%, partially due to increased professional fees ($5.1 million) as well as increased client goodwill gestures and authenticity claims ($2.7 million).
For the first six months of 2007, revenues reached a record high of $486.9 million, a $142.6 million, or 41%, improvement largely due to a 45% increase in Consolidated Sales
1
to a record $3.24 billion. Private sales also saw strong growth with a 43% increase to $334.0 million, surpassing our full year 2006 private sales total of $327.9 million. Income from continuing operations for the first half of 2007 was a record $131.7 million, a $63.2 million, or 92%, increase from the first half of 2006. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.02 for the first half of 2007, a 77% increase from the prior period figure of $1.14. This growth is partially offset by the expense increases mentioned previously and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations (a $12.9 million impact versus the prior period).
The Company's results for the first half of 2007 were significantly impacted by a one-time benefit of $20 million related to an insurance recovery from the key man life insurance policy covering Robert Noortman, who died unexpectedly in January 2007 and a $4.8 million gain on the sale of our former Billingshurst salesroom property in the United Kingdom, partially offset by a $15 million impairment charge related to intangible assets and goodwill of Noortman Master Paintings, B.V. Excluding these items, income from continuing operations
2
for the first half of 2007 would have been $123.3 million, or $1.89 per diluted share
2
, a $54.9 million, or 80%, improvement from the first half of 2006. Also excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA
2
for the first half of 2007 would
have been $195.8 million, a $64.9 million, or 50%, improvement from the first half of 2006.
"These past six months have been historic by all standards" said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "In this six month period we earned more than in any full year in our history. We believe that these results validate our strategy, demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our business model and highlight our ability to execute in a strong art market. They reaffirm our commitment to our clients, our employees and our shareholders. And, very importantly, they reaffirm our commitment to profitability."
Second and Third Quarter Sales
In a remarkable season, Sotheby's sold four of the top five lots, including the top lot of the season, Mark Rothko's White Center
(Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose)
from the Collection of David and Peggy Rockefeller, which had a pre-sale estimate of $40 million
3
and sold for $72.8 million, setting the record for a Contemporary Art work at auction. Francis Bacon's
Study from Pope Innocent X

Self-Portrait

Nymphas
brought $36.7 million. Sotheby's sold 391 lots for $1 million or more in the first half of 2007.
The Contemporary Art series of sales in New York brought $344.6 million, Sotheby's highest total ever in this category and up 86% from May 2006. The New York May Impressionist sales also achieved excellent results with a total of $337.2 million, in line with the pre-sale estimate of $265/361 million
3
, and up 36% from the prior year.
Sotheby's June fine arts sales in London were our best ever, bringing $402.5 million for the week. The Impressionist and Modern Art Sales brought $209.4 million and were highlighted by the sale of Claude Monet's
Nymphas
for $36.7 million, well above the pre-sale estimate of $20/30 million
3
. London's Contemporary Art sales totaled a
remarkable $193.1 million, more than double last year's figure of $77.6 million and significantly above the pre-sale estimate of $112/157 million
3
.
Sotheby's spring sale of American Paintings in New York brought $55.8 million, well above the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $32/47 million
3
. The highlights of the sale were Albert Bierstadt's
Mountain Lake
which sold for $4.9 million, about double the pre-sale estimate of $2/3 million
3
and Norman Rockwell's
Home on Leave
which sold for $4.5 million, above the pre-sale estimate of $2/3 million
3
.
In our June Antiquities sale in New York, the auction record for any sculpture was shattered when the beautiful bronze statue
Artemis and the Stag
sold for an outstanding $28.6 million, more than four times the pre-sale high estimate of $7 million
3
. The sale achieved $47.2 million, the highest ever total for an Antiquities sale, and significantly above the pre-sale estimate of $8/12 million
3
.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangement of a Registrant
     
From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company will guarantee to consignors a minimum price in connection with the sale of property at auction. The Company must perform under its auction guarantee in the event the property sells for less than the minimum price, in which event the Company must pay the difference between the sale price at auction and the amount of the auction guarantee. If the property does not sell, the amount of the auction guarantee must be paid, but the Company has the right to recover such amount through future sale of the property. In certain of these instances, the sale proceeds ultimately realized by the Company have exceeded the amount of any prior losses recognized on the auction guarantee. Additionally, the Company is generally entitled to a share of the excess proceeds if the property under the auction guarantee sells above a minimum price. The Company is obligated under the terms of certain guarantees to advance a portion of the guaranteed amount prior to the auction. In certain situations, the Company reduces its financial exposure under auction guarantees through auction sharing arrangements with unaffiliated partners. Partners may also assist the Company in valuing and marketing the property to be sold at auction.
     
As reported in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, as of August 7, 2007, the Company had outstanding auction guarantees totaling $274.9 million. Subsequent to that date and through the date of this filing, the Company has entered into additional auction guarantees totaling $103.2 million. Included in this amount are a number of recent significant auction guarantees, which brought the Company's aggregate outstanding auction guarantees to $378.1 million, the property relating to which had a mid-estimate sales price (1) of $400.2 million. The property related to such auction guarantees is being offered at auctions primarily in the second half of 2007. As of August 21, 2007, $53.7 million of the guaranteed amount had been advanced by the Company.
     
As part of its regular risk management practices, the Company periodically establishes a maximum dollar amount of auction guarantees that may be outstanding based upon, among other things, the supply of, and demand for, quality fine arts, decorative arts and collectibles. In August 2007, management recommended and the Board of Directors approved an outstanding auction guarantee limit of $500 million. In the first half of 2007, Sotheby's offered property for sale at auction subject to $482 million in auction guarantees, with $326 million being the largest aggregate amount outstanding at any one time. As of August 21, 2007, the Company had made offers of auction guarantees to potential sellers of property that, if contractually finalized, together with $378.1 million of guarantees outstanding as of that date, would bring its total outstanding auction guarantees within approximately $25 million of the current limit. The current limit was established after assessing the performance of the Company's auction guarantees in the first six months of 2007 and further reviewing the last 14 years of auction guarantee experience. In each year during that 14-year period, as well as the first six months of 2007, the Company has realized a profit on its auction guarantee portfolio. For the year ended 2006 and for the six months ended June 30, 2007, approximately 16% of Net Auction Sales have consisted of property subject to auction guarantees.
Item 8.01. Other Events
     
Effective September 1, 2007, the Company will increase its buyer's premium charged on certain auction sales. In salesrooms in the United States (the "U.S."), the buyer's premium will be 25% of the hammer (sale) price on the first $20,000, 20% of the hammer (sale) price above $20,000 up to and including $500,000 and 12% of any remaining amount over $500,000. In foreign salesrooms, with exceptions for certain locations, these U.S. dollar thresholds will generally be translated into an appropriate fixed local currency amount. Previously, the buyer's premium charged on auction sales was generally 20% of the hammer (sale) price on the first $500,000 and 12% of any remaining amount over $500,000.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On November 9, 2007, Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.

News Release
 
Press Department:

Jennifer Park
(212) 894-1023
November 9, 2007, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2007.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the Company reported operating revenues of $85.1 million, a $27.7 million, or 48%, increase from the prior period, primarily due to higher auction commission revenues and private sales commissions. For the third quarter of 2007, loss from continuing operations was ($20.9) million, or ($0.33) per diluted share, compared to ($30.4) million, or ($0.49) per diluted share for the prior period, a $9.5 million, or 31%, improvement. This improvement, which is due to the increase in revenues highlighted above, is partially offset by certain expense increases.
These favorable results for the quarter when compared to the prior year were achieved after taking into account losses on certain auction guarantees in this week's Impressionist and Modern Art sale. The pre-tax $14.6 million in losses related to these auction guarantees is reflected within the Company's results for the third quarter of 2007 as these guarantees were outstanding as of September 30, 2007.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales in the third quarter have historically represented only approximately 7%-10% of annual Auction Sales, and the third quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, third quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
For the first nine months of 2007, operating revenues were a record $572.0 million, a $170.3 million, or 42%, improvement from the prior period. This increase is largely due to a 40% increase in auction commission revenues to $457.5 million from the prior period and a 111% increase in private sales commissions over the period to $42.7 million which is largely due to a 52% increase in Consolidated Sales* to $3.8 billion. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 was a record $110.7 million, a $72.7 million, or 191%, increase from the prior period. For the first nine months of 2007, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.69, more than double the prior period figure of $0.62.
The Company's results for the first nine months of 2007 were significantly impacted by a one-time benefit of $20 million related to an insurance recovery from the key man life insurance policy covering Robert Noortman, who died unexpectedly in January 2007 and a $4.8 million gain on the sale of our former Billingshurst salesroom property in the United Kingdom, partially offset by a $15 million impairment charge related to intangible assets and goodwill of Noortman Master Paintings, B.V. Excluding these items, income from
continuing operations* for the first nine months of 2007 would have been $102.4 million, or $1.56 per diluted share*, a $64.4 million, or 169%, improvement from the prior period.
"The art market has shown considerable strength since the beginning of our fall season and we remain positive for the remainder of the year," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "Our aggregate auction sales from September 1
st
through yesterday are up 32% from the equivalent period in 2006 and total $1.1 billion."
"We are pleased to report that our Impressionist and Modern Art sales this week were profitable," Mr. Ruprecht continued. "However, these results fell below our pre-sale expectations. Our Impressionist and Modern Art sales totaled $331.5 million, a 12% increase over the previous year and our third highest total ever. Sotheby's sold the top lot of the week, Paul Gauguin's
Te Poipoi (The Morning)
which sold for $39.2 million, just below the current Gauguin record of $40.3 million set one year ago, and sold ten works for over $10 million, in comparison to seven in our May Impressionist sales." Mr. Ruprecht added, "with respect to auction guarantees, we have made money on our overall guarantee portfolio year after year and despite the losses recorded in the third quarter, it is our current expectation that we will make money on an aggregate basis this year as well."
Fourth Quarter Sales
Last month, Asia Week in Hong Kong achieved its highest total ever for a series of sales. The nine sales brought $200.1 million, 46% higher than last year's total of $137.2 million and well above the pre-sale estimate of $129/173 million. Chinese Works of Art were in high demand, bringing $83.1 million with its three sales highlighted by the
Imperially Inscribed Tai Shang Huang Di' White Jade Seal
which sold for $5.9 million, a record for white jade at auction. Asian Contemporary Art brought a record $42.5 million, soundly above its high estimate of $28 million. Also, Sotheby's Magnificent Jewels and Jadeite sale brought a record $40.8 million, highlighted by a 6.04 carat
Superb and Extremely Rare Fancy Vivid Blue Diamond Ring
which brought $8.0 million and the per-carat record for a gemstone at auction.
In London last month, Sotheby's held a successful series of Contemporary Art sales in conjunction with the increasingly popular Frieze Art Fair. The three sales brought a total of $134.8 million, near the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $99/138 million and 111% above the prior year's London October Contemporary Art sales. Nineteen auction records were set during the series, highlighted by record for a Chinese Contemporary Work of Art sold at auction, Yue Minjun's
Execution
which sold for $6 million.
In New York at the end of October, the two-day sale of property from the legendary
Galerie Ariane Dandois
in Paris brought an outstanding $32.8 million, well above the pre-sale high estimate of $20 million. Many of the top prices were for Neoclassical furniture and for objects from across the Continent. The sale achieved the highest total ever for a dealer sale in this category and over half of the lots sold for above their high estimates.
Also in New York last month, Sotheby's Photographs sale brought the highest total ever for Sotheby's in this category with a total of $11 million, above the estimate of $7/10 million. Highlighting the sale was Edward Weston's
Nautilus
which brought $1.1 million and a record for the artist at auction. Records were also set for Imogen Cunningham, Frederick Sommer, Aaron Siskind, Louis Faurer, Peter Beard and Herb Ritts, among others.
Sotheby's had planned to auction the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Collection of Russian Art in late September in London. However, the Collection was purchased in its entirety prior to the auction for an undisclosed sum by Alisher Usmanov, a prominent Russian businessman, with the intention to bring the Collection to Russia, to the delight of the Vishnevskaya family and the Russian Federal Agency of Culture and Cinematography.
Sotheby's fall New York Contemporary sales will take place next week on November 14
th
and 15
th
and are estimated to achieve $298 to $408 million. Highlights include two works by Francis Bacon,
Bullfight
and

million and $15 million, respectively. Other highlights are Jeff Koons'
Hanging Heart (Magenta/Gold)
(estimated at $15/20 million), Mark Rothko's
Untitled

In London on November 26
th
and 27
th
, sales of Russian art are estimated to bring $50/75 million. The highlights of the evening sale are Natalia Sergeevna Goncharova's

Still life with Tray
which is one of his finest compositions to remain in private hands (estimated at $3/4 million). Other featured artists are Aristarkh Lentulov, Mikhail Larionov and Konstantin Korovin.

In early December, Sotheby's will be offering the
Magna Carta
for sale in New York. Arguably the most famous single document in existence, this iconic manuscript, dated 1297, is the original charter that enshrined the rights of man into English law, and inspired the passion for liberty that flowered in America in the 18
th
century and continues around the world today. Issued by King Edward I, and sealed by the king, this astonishing survivor is one of fewer than twenty examples of the
Magna Carta
, and the only one ever likely to be sold. It is estimated to sell for $20/30 million.
Also in early December in New York, Sotheby's is looking forward to selling one of the most important relics of George Washington's life, his specially commissioned Order of the Cincinnati Medal. Following Washington's death in 1799, his family presented the medal to the Marquis de Lafayette whom Washington considered his adopted son and who was a key figure in the American Revolutionary War. The Cincinnati Medal is estimated to bring $4/10 million.
On December 5
th
in New York, Sotheby's will be selling in its Antiquities sale one of the last known masterworks from the dawn of civilization still in private hands,
The
Guennol Lioness

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          
On February 7, 2003, Sotheby's (or the "Company") sold the land and building located at 1334 York Avenue, New York, N.Y. (the "York Property") to an affiliate of RFR Holding Corp. ("RFR"). The York Property is home to the Company's North American Auction, Dealer and Finance operations, as well as its corporate offices. In conjunction with this sale, the Company leased the York Property back from RFR for an initial 20-year term. (For additional information with respect to the lease, see Note 11 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2007.)
          
On January 11, 2008, the Company entered into a contract to acquire the York Property from an affiliate of RFR for $370 million. The Company also agreed to give the principals of RFR certain terms for future sales of works of art at Sotheby's auctions. The Company intends to finance the purchase price through the assumption of an existing $235 million mortgage on the York Property (which bears interest at an annual rate of approximately 5.6%), and a combination of available cash resources and possible future borrowings. The Company has made an upfront payment to the seller of $50 million, and the closing of the sale will take place not later than July 1, 2009, nor earlier than April 1, 2008. The closing of the sale of the York Property will resolve all open issues between the Company and RFR relating to the York Property.
          
To permit the consummation of this transaction, including the assumption of the existing $235 million mortgage on the York Property, the Company amended its senior secured credit agreement with an international syndicate of lenders arranged by Banc of America Securities LLC.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

SOTHEBY'S ANNOUNCES 2007 FOURTH
QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS
 
  
 - 
Highest Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results in Company History
 
  
 - 
Full Year Revenues of $917.7 million up 38% and Net Income of $213.1 million up 99% with diluted EPS of $3.25
 
  
 - 
February 2008 Impressionist & Modern Art Sales in London Achieved $285.0 million, Sotheby's Highest Result Ever in Europe
 
February 26, 2008, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported record revenues of $345.8 million, an $82.6 million, or 31%, increase over the prior fourth quarter, primarily due to higher auction commission revenues. The Company's net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was a record $102.4 million, or $1.55 per diluted share compared to $70.3 million, or $1.09, per diluted share for the prior period, a 46%, or $32.1 million improvement, largely due to growth in auction commission revenues. These results include a $32.2 million, or 49%, increase in salaries and related costs, due to higher incentive compensation costs attributable to the strong results for the period as well as higher full time salaries.
 
 
 
 
 
 
2007 brought the best financial results for Sotheby's in its 264-year history. Total revenues were $917.7 million which is $252.9 million, or 38%, higher than the prior year largely due to a $210.0 million, or 38%, improvement in auction commission revenues. This increase in total revenues is primarily attributable to a 51% increase in Consolidated Sales* which rose to $6.2 billion in 2007. Operating income of $275.8 million was $78.6 million, or 40%, ahead of the prior year. Net income for the full year 2007 totaled $213.1 million, about double the 2006 figure of $107.0 million. These strong results, due to the revenue increases mentioned above, are partially offset by a 30% rise in salaries and related costs from higher incentive compensation costs due to the exceptional financial performance for the year as well as increased full time salaries and stock compensation expense over the period. Also, general and administrative expenses increased by 22% partly due to a 33% increase in professional fees and a 28% increase in travel and entertainment costs over the period.
 
The Company's results for the full year 2007 were significantly impacted by a one-time benefit of $20 million related to an insurance recovery from the key man life insurance policy covering Robert Noortman, who died unexpectedly in January 2007, and a $4.8 million gain on the sale of our former Billingshurst salesroom property in the United Kingdom, partially offset by a $15 million impairment charge related to intangible assets and goodwill of Noortman Master Paintings, B.V. Excluding these items, 2007 net income* would have been a record $204.8 million, or $3.12 per diluted share*, 91% higher than the prior year figure of $107.0 million, with adjusted EBITDA* a record $313.8 million, a 44% increase.
 
"2007 was a record year for Sotheby's, significantly exceeding the Company's outstanding performance in 2006," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "A 91% increase in adjusted net income* and a 44% increase in adjusted EBITDA* are clear indications of our continued improvement in profitability.
 
"Contributing to these results were Sotheby's sale of the top lot of the year and Sotheby's sale of four out of the five top lots of the year**, while we strategically reduced lot volume by 42% on the low end. In 2007, we sold 41 lots above $10 million compared to 20 works in 2006. Our commitment to quality versus quantity translated into tremendous success in 2007," continued Mr. Ruprecht.
 
"Over the past five years, the number of clients buying at the top end of our business has increased by more than 200% and their geographical diversity has expanded by over 60%," he added. "In 2003 our top buyers
 
2
 
 
 purchasing lots of $500,000 and above  came from 36 countries; in 2007 they came from 58 countries. Our increased global focus on our top clients is delivering excellent results  for our business, for our clients, our employees and for our shareholders."
 
Many areas were particularly noteworthy in 2007. For the first time, Contemporary Art became Sotheby's largest category with auction sales of $1.34 billion, an increase of 107% from the prior year. Sales of Impressionist and Modern Art rose by 24% to $1.16 billion. Emerging markets performed strongly as well. Russian Paintings and Works of Art brought $190.9 million, a 25% increase from the prior year. Sales in Asia totaled $400.7 million, a 41% increase from the prior year and worldwide sales of Contemporary Asian Art brought $140.0 million, 99% above the prior year level. Traditional categories also fared extremely well with Antiquities bringing $112.2, million a ten-fold increase from the prior year, primarily due to the sale of two masterpieces, and Old Master Paintings, Jewelry, British Paintings, French Furniture and European Works of Art each experienced over 40% growth in their respective categories.
 
 
Year to Date 2008 Sales
Worldwide sales to date in 2008 have been strong. In New York, the Old Masters Paintings sale in January totaled $82.5 million, virtually comparable to the same sales held in January 2007 with the exception of Rembrandt's
Portrait of
St. James the Greater
which brought $25.8 million in last year's sale. Last month's sale was highlighted by a figure of Saint Catherine, circa 1505, by German Medieval sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider. The sculpture sold for $6.3 million, a record for the artist at auction and above its high estimate of $6 million. Seventeen works sold for $1 million or more.
 
The London Impressionist and Modern Art sales led the market earlier this month with a total of $285.0 million, up 20% from the prior year, with the evening sale recording the highest total ever for any sale in Sotheby's Europe. The top lot, Franz Marc's
Weidende Pferde III,
sold for $24.3 million, the highest price for an Impressionist or Modern work so far in 2008. The average lot value of the evening sale was $4.3 million with 70% of the 67 lots sold achieving $1 million or more.

Item 5.02 - Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
          
On March 7, 2008 the employment arrangements of William F. Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's ("Sotheby's" or the "Company"), William S. Sheridan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sotheby's and Robin G. Woodhead, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive, Sotheby's International, were amended to accommodate certain changes in Sotheby's incentive compensation program. Under Sotheby's new program, beginning in 2008, incentive compensation awards will be weighted to a greater degree based on achievement of individual financial and other performance objectives rather than on achievement of companywide financial performance. However, it is intended that each individual will have the same overall bonus opportunity under the new program as he did under the old one. Sotheby's new incentive compensation philosophy will be described in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of Sotheby's Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 6, 2008.
          
Mr. Ruprecht's employment arrangement previously provided for an annual award of restricted stock of not less than $1.4 million nor more than $2.2 million, with the variability of any award over $1.7 million determined with reference to the achievement of various thresholds of financial performance under Sotheby's Executive Bonus Plan ("EBP"). In conjunction with the changes to the Company's incentive compensation philosophy described above, Mr. Ruprecht's employment arrangement has been amended so that his annual award of restricted stock within the same $1.4 -$2.2 million range will now be determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee based on Company financial performance and his individual performance.
          
Mr. Sheridan previously received a cash incentive bonus based on individual performance determined with reference to an incentive bonus target and an award of restricted stock under the EBP determined in a formulaic manner based on the achievement of financial thresholds set by the Compensation Committee. Under his Severance Agreement, he had the right to terminate his employment for good reason and receive severance pay if either his cash incentive bonus target or his bonus target for EBP awards was reduced below $350,000. Under the new incentive compensation program, beginning in 2008, his bonus target for cash and restricted stock awards will each remain at $350,000, but both awards will be determined with reference to Company financial and individual performance. Accordingly, his Severance Agreement has been amended to eliminate certain references to the EBP and provide that he will be able to terminate his employment for good reason if either bonus target is reduced below that level.
          
Mr. Woodhead's Service Agreement previously provided for a cash incentive bonus based on individual performance determined with reference to an incentive bonus target and an award of restricted stock under the EBP determined in a formulaic manner based on the achievement of financial thresholds set by the Compensation Committee. The amendment to his Service Agreement reflects the new incentive compensation program under which, beginning in 2008, Mr. Woodhead will have separate bonus targets of 200,000 each for awards in cash and in restricted stock, both of which will be determined with reference to Company financial and individual performance.
          
Mr. Ruprecht's employment arrangement and Mr. Sheridan's Severance Agreement were also amended to take into account recent regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments provide that the payment of any amount due on termination of employment will be deferred for six months in order to avoid an excise tax on such payment. Deferred amounts will bear interest at the Applicable Federal Rate determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
          
Mr. Woodhead's Service Agreement was also amended (i) to increase his base salary from 262,350 to 300,000, (ii) to provide that termination of his employment on or after April 1, 2009 will constitute Retirement (as defined in Sotheby's Restricted Stock Plan) with a result that all non-performance based shares of restricted stock will vest immediately and (iii) to provide that, upon retirement on or after April 1, 2009 at any time other than at the end of a full year, he will be entitled to a partial year bonus for the portion of the year prior to termination of his employment.

On May 9, 2008, Sothebys, a Delaware corporation (the Company) issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2008. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
News Release
May 9, 2008, New York -- Sothebys (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2008, the Company reported revenues of $129.3 million, an $18.1 million, or 12%, decrease over the prior first quarter, primarily due to lower auction commission margins as compared to the prior year (13.6% auction commission margin in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to 16.6% in the first quarter of 2007). Net auction sales increased a modest 2%; however, this reflects an increase in higher value works of art, consistent with our long-term strategic objectives, and is partially offset by a significant decrease in single owner sales from the prior first quarter. Typically, high-value objects carry relatively lower commission margins.
The Companys net loss for the first quarter of 2008 was ($12.4) million, or ($0.19) per diluted share compared to net income of $24.3 million, or $0.37, per diluted share for the prior period, a $36.7 million decline, largely due to the shortfall in auction commission revenues and secondarily to planned higher operating expenses. These results include a $6.4 million, or 12%, increase in salaries and related costs, due to higher full time salaries and stock compensation expense over the period, partially offset by lower employee benefits expense, and a $7.4 million, or 20%
increase in general and administrative costs due to higher professional fees and travel and entertainment expenses.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market and Sothebys sales calendar, first and third quarters are expected to be loss quarters. First quarter Auction Sales have historically represented approximately 9% - 14% of annual Auction Sales, and the first quarter has been a loss period for the Company all but twice in the last eighteen years. As a result, typically, first quarter results have not been indicative of expected full year results and we caution investors, as always, to assess the business in six and twelve month periods.
The market continues to be strong, and the demand for great works of art remains high, as we have seen throughout the spring, and most recently on Wednesday night, said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sothebys. We are encouraged by year to date sales thus far, which are up 11% as of yesterday and include strong results from our New York Impressionist sales. And we are looking forward to an excellent series of Contemporary Sales next week, which includes Francis Bacons masterpiece
Triptych, 1976
, which is expected to bring in the region of $70 million.
Mr. Ruprecht continued: In the first quarter we reduced our auction guarantee risk exposure as we believe it to be an appropriately prudent approach to risk management during this time of greater financial market uncertainty
.
This necessarily required our agreeing to thinner commission margins in order to win consignments. In addition, competition at the high end accelerated in the quarter which also brought pressure on commission margins. That more conservative approach, which is the right one for these times, was a major factor in these results.
In order to enhance our revenue stream and strengthen profit margins, we are today announcing a pricing change of 25% on the first $50,000 of hammer; 20% on the next $950,000 of hammer; and 12% above hammer of $1 million effective as of June 1
st
. For over 95% of the lots we sell,
this change will represent an increase of 2% or less in the final purchase price, continued Mr. Ruprecht.
Second Quarter Sales
Earlier this week, Sothebys New York sales of Impressionist and Modern Art totaled $273 million, well within the pre-sale estimate of $245/337 million. The highlights of the evening sale were Fernand Lgers Cubist masterpiece,
tude Pour la Femme en Bleu,
which sold for a record $39.2 million and Edvard Munchs
Girls on a Bridge
which surpassed the high estimate and brought a record $30.8 million. Seven lots sold for over $10 million and the average lot value of the evening sale was $5.7 million compared to $5.1 million the previous spring and $4.8 million last November.
Last month, Sothebys Hong Kong held a record week of sales which totaled $227.1 million, a 62% increase from the prior spring sales series. Highlights included the record for any Chinese work of art sold at auction, a
Rare Gold Tripod Vessel and Cover from the Ming Dynasty
which sold for $14.9 million; the record for a Song ceramic sold at auction, an
Outstanding Guan Mallet Vase
for $8.6 million; and the record for Qing Gold sold at auction, a
Magnificent Gold, Cloisonne and Beijing Enameled Tibetan-Styled Ewer
for $7.2 million. Chinese Contemporary Art also experienced remarkable results with the three sales totaling $51.6 million, well above the pre-sale estimate of $35/$46 million.
Our Russian Art sales in New York last month brought $46.4 million, well within the pre-sale estimate of $41/57 million. Strong prices were realized across the wide variety of works on offer  19
th
and 20
th
Century and Contemporary Russian paintings as well as a broad selection of works of art, particularly icons and bronzes. Highlighting the sales were Arkhip Kuindzis
Birch Grove
which brought $3.1 million, a record for the artist at auction.
Last month in London, the very successful spring sale of Islamic Works of Art brought a record $42.4 million, more than double the pre-sale low estimate of $19 million. The major contributor
to the success of the sale was an
Abbasid kaba key
, one of the most powerful symbols of Islam and the only one known to remain in private hands. The key sold for $18.1 million, eighteen times the pre-sale high estimate of $1 million.
Upcoming Sales
Next week, our Contemporary Art sales take place in New York with our highest estimates ever of $375/477 million. The undisputed highlight of the sale is Francis Bacons
Triptych, 1976
which is estimated to achieve in the region of $70 million. Drawing from Greek mythology, the work reveals in a single composition the entire range of Bacons iconography over three decades of painting. Also featured in the evening sale is Mark Rothkos
Orange, Red, Yellow
(est. in excess of $35 million) which is a radiantly beautiful and monumental work from his most productive period of the 1950s. Other featured works are by Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Yves Klein and Tom Wesselmann.
Also in New York, our American Paintings sale on May 22
nd
is highlighted by Edward Hicks
Peaceable Kingdom
, arguably the best of his career and estimated to achieve $6/8 million. Other notable works are by Frederic Remington, Childe Hassam, Maxfield Parrish and Norman Rockwell. The entire sale is estimated to bring $53/77 million.
Note: All estimates do not include buyers premium.

Item 8.01  Other Events
     
In April 1997, the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) began an investigation of certain art dealers and major auction houses, including Sothebys (the Company) and its principal competitor, Christies International, PLC (Christies). The Company pled guilty to a violation of United States (U.S.) antitrust laws in connection with a conspiracy to fix auction commission rates charged to sellers in the U.S. and elsewhere.
     
In conjunction with the settlement of certain civil litigation related to the investigation by the DOJ, in May 2003, the Company and Christies issued to the class of plaintiffs vendors commission discount certificates (Discount Certificates) with a face value of $125 million, of which the Company was responsible for funding the redemption of $62.5 million. The court determined that this $62.5 million face value had a fair market value of not less than $50 million, which is the amount of expense that was recognized by the Company as a Special Charge in the third quarter of 2000. The $12.5 million discount on the face value of the Discount Certificates was amortized to interest expense over the four-year period prior to May 15, 2007.
     
The Discount Certificates were fully redeemable in connection with any auction conducted by the Company or Christies in the U.S. or in the United Kingdom and were able to be used to satisfy consignment charges involving vendors commission, risk of loss and/or catalogue illustration. Additionally, any unused Discount Certificates were redeemable for cash at their face value at any time between May 15, 2007 and May 14, 2008.
     
The Discount Certificates expired on May 14, 2008 and, therefore, cannot be redeemed subsequent to that date. As of May 14, 2008, the remaining face value and the Companys related liability for the unused Discount Certificates was approximately $18 million. In the second quarter of 2008, as a result of the expiration of the Discount Certificates, the Company will reverse the remaining liability and recognize a non-recurring income statement benefit of approximately $18 million.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to Regulation FD, Sotheby's furnishes the information below. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we" and "our" refer to Sotheby's and all of its subsidiaries consolidated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The following are our preliminary estimates of our results of operations for the three months ending June 30, 2008.
Based on our results for April and May 2008 and on our current expectations of results for the remainder of the quarter, we estimate that our revenues for the three months ending June 30, 2008 will be between $305 million and $330 million and that operating income will be between $135 million and $160 million, compared to revenues of $340 million and operating income of $157 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007. Included in operating income is depreciation and amortization expense of $5.9 million and $5.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
As previously reported, our operating income for the three months ending June 30, 2008 will include a non-recurring income statement benefit of approximately $18 million for the reversal of the liability for unused vendor's commission discount certificates that expired on May 14, 2008. Subsequent to May 14, 2008, these discount certificates can no longer be redeemed and, as a result, this income statement benefit will be recognized in the second quarter of 2008. These discount certificates, which were issued in May 2003 in conjunction with our settlement of certain antitrust litigation, were able to be used to satisfy consignment charges involving vendor's commission, risk of loss and/or catalogue illustration. In addition, any unused discount certificates were redeemable for cash at their face value at any time between May 15, 2007 and May 14, 2008.
Traditionally, Sotheby's has conducted its major early summer auctions of Impressionist & Modern Art and Contemporary Art in London in the last week of June. Our results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 include results attributable to the Contemporary Art auctions in London. The net auction sales from these Contemporary Art auctions totaled approximately $167 million. However, in 2008, we have decided to schedule our summer auctions of Contemporary Art in the week following the Impressionist Art sales. Accordingly, our Contemporary Art auctions in London will occur in early July this year, and our results from those auctions will be reflected in the third quarter of 2008.
The art market has remained strong throughout 2008, reflecting the steady global demand for works of art. Assuming that the Contemporary Art auctions in London were held in the third quarter of 2007, rather
than in the second quarter, when they actually occurred, we would expect net auction sales for the six months ending June 30, 2008 to be approximately $125 million to $175 million ahead of the comparable period in 2007. However, we have earned lower auction commission margins during 2008, which is due, in part, to our decision to reduce our auction guarantee risk in response to an uncertain economic environment. In addition, our operating margins in 2008 have been adversely affected by an increase in sales of higher value works of art, which results in lower aggregate commission margins, as well as increased competition for auction consignments.
We have recently initiated several measures to enhance profitability. For example, we announced an increase to our buyer's premium, effective June 1, 2008, and we are taking steps to reduce our operating expenses.
The preceding discussion of our results for the quarter ending June 30, 2008 contains estimates that are subject to change due to the completion of our June sales, the completion of our normal quarterly closing procedures, including final accounting adjustments, and other developments that may arise until our financial results for the period are finalized. Our actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Additionally, neither our independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information. See "Forward-Looking Statements."
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 8-K contains certain forward looking statements; as such term is defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to future events and the future financial performance of Sotheby's.
The forward looking statements contained in this Form 8-K are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. There can be no assurances that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global, regional or local political, economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, those described in our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2008 under Item 1A, "Risk Factors." Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward looking statements.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On June 17, 2008, Sotheby's (the "
Company
") issued $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the "
Convertible Notes

Senior Notes
" and together with the Convertible Notes, the "
Notes
") to Banc of America Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Comerica Securities, Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (collectively, the "
Initial Purchasers
"). The net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes and the Senior Notes was approximately $340.2 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts.
 
Convertible Notes
 
The Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of June 17, 2008 (the "
Convertible Notes Indenture
"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and will bear interest at a rate of 3.125% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2008. The Convertible Notes will mature on June 15, 2013, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of the Company's common stock ("
Common Stock
"), or a combination thereof, at the option of the Company, based on an initial conversion rate of 29.4122 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment. Prior to March 15, 2013, such conversion is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth below. Holders of the Convertible Notes who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) will, under certain circumstances, be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. In addition, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Note under any of the following circumstances:
 
 
In addition, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes at any time beginning on March 15, 2013 and ending on the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof at its election.
 
Each of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries will jointly, severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee the Convertible Notes on a senior unsecured basis to the extent such subsidiaries guarantee its senior secured credit facility.
 
 
 
Senior Notes
 
The Senior Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of June 17, 2008 (the "
Senior Notes Indenture
" and together with the Convertible Notes Indenture, the "
Indentures
"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and will bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2008. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2015, unless earlier repurchased.
 
The Senior Notes will not be redeemable at any time before maturity except at the make-whole price specified in the Senior Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2011, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price of 107.75% plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
If the Company experiences a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture), the Company must offer to repurchase all of the Senior Notes then outstanding at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
The Senior Notes Indenture also contains covenants that limit, among other things, the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to:
 
 
Each of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries will jointly, severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee the Senior Notes on a senior unsecured basis to the extent such subsidiaries guarantee the Company's senior secured credit facility.
 
Registration Rights Agreement
 
The Company has entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of June 17, 2008 (the "
Registration Rights Agreement
") with Banc of America Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as representatives of the Initial Purchasers (the "
Representatives
"), pursuant to which the Company has agreed to consummate an offer to exchange the Senior Notes for a new issue of debt securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""), with terms substantially identical to those of the Senior Notes (except for the provisions relating to the transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) no later than 366 days after the date of the initial issuance of the notes. However, the Registration Rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to consummate the exchange offer if (i) the Senior Notes are freely tradable before the required date for the consummation of such exchange offer, and (ii) on or before such date the restrictive legend on the Senior Notes has been removed. If the Company fails to satisfy its registration obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, it will be required to pay additional interest to the holders of the Senior Notes under certain circumstances.
Securities Act
 
Convertible Note Hedge Transactions
 
On June 11, 2008, in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its Common Stock (the "
Convertible Note Hedges
") with affiliates of Banc of America Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (collectively, the "
Counterparties
"). The Convertible Note Hedges will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 5,882,440 million shares of Common
 
 
 
Stock. The Convertible Note Hedges have an exercise price equal to the conversion price of the Convertible Notes and are intended to offset potential dilution to Sotheby's common stock upon potential future conversion of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Convertible Notes.
 
The Convertible Note Hedges are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Convertible Note Hedges.
 
Warrant Transactions
 
On June 11, 2008, the Company also entered into warrant transactions, whereby the Company agreed to sell to the Counterparties warrants (the "
Warrants

The Warrants have an exercise price of $44.9050, which is approximately 75% above the closing price of the Common Stock on June 11, 2008. The Warrants could have a dilutive effect on the Company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the Common Stock exceeds the exercise price of the Warrants.
 
The issuance of the Warrants is a separate transaction, entered into by the Company with the Counterparties, and is not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants.

(212) 894-1023
August 5, 2008, New York -- Sothebys (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the second quarter and first half ended June 30, 2008.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Company reported revenues of $320.2 million, a $19.3 million, or 6%, decrease over the prior second quarter, primarily due to the shift of our summer Contemporary sales in London from the second quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008. Those sales brought auction commission revenues of $24 million in the second quarter of 2007 and will contribute approximately $26 million to auction commission revenues in the third quarter of 2008. Auction commission margin in the second quarter of 2008 was 15.1% which is much improved from the 13.6% auction
commission margin in the first quarter of 2008 although not quite as high as prior year second quarter auction commission margin of 16.0% . Also impacting revenues in the second quarter of 2008 are unfavorable principal activities results for the period.
The Companys net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $95.3 million, or $1.46 per diluted share compared to net income of $107.3 million, or $1.64, per diluted share for the prior period, a $12.0 million decline, largely due to the aforementioned calendar shift. This decline is partially offset by lower operating expenses, which totaled $169.3 million compared to $182.0 million in the prior period, a $12.8 million, or 7% improvement. Operating expenses include an $18.4 million one-time benefit ($11.7 million after-tax) recognized as a result of the reversal of the remaining liability related to the vendors commission discount certificates that expired in May 2008 and were issued by the Company in 2003 in conjunction with the settlement of antitrust related civil litigation. The reduction in operating expenses is also partially attributable to a decrease in incentive bonus accruals as a result of the lower profitability of the first half and is somewhat offset by increased direct costs, primarily due to higher consignment and sales levels in Hong Kong, as well as higher catalogue and sale promotion costs related to the May Impressionist and Contemporary Art sales in New York.
For the first six months of 2008, aggregate auction sales were $3.0 billion, a record for Sothebys, and revenues were $449.4 million, a $37.5 million, or 8% decline from the prior period due to the previously mentioned sales shift from the second quarter to the third quarter ($24 million revenue benefit in the first half of 2007) as well as lower auction commission margins and unfavorable principal activities results in the current period. Net income for the first half of 2008 was $82.9 million, a $48.7 million, or 37%, decline from the first half of 2007 largely due to the aforementioned shortfalls in auction and related revenues. Diluted earnings per share was $1.26 for the first half of 2008, a 38% decrease from the prior period.
These results are the second best in our history, and are remarkable in the context of todays global economic environment, said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sothebys. Our conservative approach to risk, the significant improvement in our auction commission margins in the second quarter and our focus on costs have all contributed to healthy profitability.
Our ability to successfully raise $350 million in new capital in this climate  in an oversubscribed offering  now provides us with greater liquidity than we have ever enjoyed, continued Mr. Ruprecht. Sothebys was upgraded to investment grade by Standard & Poors in early June and we have retired our $100 million bond that was due in February 2009. Our company today is in an excellent position to be flexible and competitive and to continue our long tradition as innovators in our markets. Demand has remained very strong for great works of art, and the market has continued to be robust, recently illustrated by our excellent summer sales in London. Aggregate auction sales to date of $3.4 billion are up 14%.
We are encouraged by a number of exciting events that are ahead in the autumn season. Notable among them is the landmark sale in London, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, consisting of over 200 new and exciting works by renowned artist Damien Hirst, which is estimated in excess of $130 million. Because of this sale, as well as the strong results in London of our Contemporary and Old Master sales in July, we expect a stronger third quarter than last year.
Second and Third Quarter Sales
In a most eventful season, Sothebys sold the top lot of the year thus far, Francis Bacons
Triptych, 1976
for $86.3 million, setting the record at auction for the artist as well as for any work of Contemporary Art.

Bank Credit Facility Borrowings
On October 10, 2008, Sothebys (the Company) borrowed $250 million under its $300 million long-term senior secured credit facility with Banc of America, LLC (the BofA Credit Agreement). This borrowing was done as a defensive step to ensure additional liquidity in response to the recent turbulence in the global financial markets. On October 9, 2008, prior to this borrowing, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $290 million and as a result of this borrowing, the Company had approximately $540 million in cash and cash equivalents as of October 10, 2008. The proceeds from this borrowing will be invested on a short-term basis in the highest rated United States Treasury money market funds or the highest rated over-night time deposits of major banks. Additionally, the Company may have opportunities to use this additional liquidity to increase the lending activities of its Finance segment and/or to purchase works of art for resale on favorable terms. (See statement on Forward Looking Statements.)
Auction Guarantees
As of October 10, 2008, the Company had outstanding auction guarantees totaling $306.1 million, the property relating to which has a mid-estimate sales price (1) of approximately $343 million. The Companys financial exposure under these auction guarantees is reduced by $63.3 million as a result of risk sharing arrangements with unaffiliated partners. Substantially all of the property related to these outstanding auction guarantees is being offered at auctions throughout the remainder of 2008. As of October 10, 2008, $98.1 million of the guaranteed amount had been advanced by the Company. The Company's current level of outstanding auction guarantees is significantly lower than at September 30, 2007, when the Company's outstanding auction guarantees totaled $458.5 million. (See Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as filed in the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2008 for additional information related to auction guarantees.)

Item 2.04
Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off Balance Sheet Arrangement
From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company will guarantee to consignors a minimum price in connection with the sale of property at auction (an "auction guarantee"). In the event that the property sells for less than the minimum guaranteed price, the Company must perform under the auction guarantee by funding the difference between the sale price at auction and the amount of the auction guarantee. If the property does not sell, the amount of the guarantee must be paid, but the Company has the right to recover such amount through the future sale of the property.
In October 2008, the Company held an autumn sales series in Hong Kong and a sale of Contemporary Art in London. The aggregate amount of auction guarantees related to property offered at these sales was approximately $60 million. As a result of certain of the guaranteed property failing to sell or selling for less than the minimum guaranteed price, the Company incurred a principal loss of approximately $15 million (pre-tax). The Company will recognize this loss in the third quarter of 2008 as these auction guarantees were outstanding as of September 30, 2008. As a result of the guaranteed property that failed to sell in these auctions, the Company will own inventory currently valued at approximately $11 million, which had an original mid-estimate sale price of approximately $14 million.
Subsequent to the Hong Kong and London sales discussed above and as of October 23, 2008, the Company had outstanding auction guarantees totaling $285.5 million. The Company's financial exposure under these auction guarantees is reduced by $63.3 million as a result of risk sharing arrangements with unaffiliated partners. Substantially all of the property related to such auction guarantees is being offered at auctions in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of October 23, 2008, $81.9 million of the guaranteed amount had been advanced by the Company.
The Company's current financial exposure under auction guarantees represents a 50% reduction from one year ago. In light of the current uncertainty in the global economy and volatility in the financial markets, the Company expects to continue to substantially reduce its use of auction guarantees until stability is restored in the global economy and financial markets.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     
On November 7, 2008, Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
     
(c) Exhibits
               
99.1
Sotheby's earnings press release for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release New York
November 7, 2008, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2008.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the Company reported operating revenues of $76.0 million, a $9.1 million, or 11%, decrease over the prior third quarter. This is largely due to a higher level of principal losses on auction guarantees, as well as lower private sale commissions and lower auction commission margins. Approximately $42 million of the guarantee losses relate to property offered in recent fourth quarter auction sales, as well as estimated losses related to guaranteed property to be offered in upcoming Contemporary Art sales in New York. These losses are recorded in the third quarter as the guarantee obligations were outstanding as of September 30, 2008 and the losses were judged to be probable as of that date. Revenues in the quarter benefited from a $39.9 million, or 70%, increase in auction commission revenues in the quarter due to the change in timing of Sotheby's summer Contemporary Art sales in London from the second quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008, as well as the Damien Hirst sale,
Beautiful Inside My Head Forever,
in London in September. The decrease in commission margins compared to the quarter ending September 2007 is largely due to a change in sales mix, with the added sales of Contemporary Art carrying lower margins, as is typical for higher end sales. When compared to the second
 
quarter of 2008, auction commission margin for the third quarter of 2008 increased slightly to 15.2% . When compared to the first quarter of 2008, auction commission margin improved by 12% (from 13.6% to 15.2%) . This improvement is primarily due to a change in sales mix, the Company's efforts to manage terms afforded to consignors and an increase to the buyer's premium effective June 1
st
.
The Company's net loss for the third quarter of 2008 was ($46.2) million, or ($0.71) per diluted share compared to a net loss of ($20.9) million, or ($0.33), per diluted share for the prior period, a $25.3 million decline. This deterioration is largely due to the principal activities losses mentioned previously as well as increased direct costs, higher borrowing costs and a lower effective income tax rate, resulting in a lower income tax benefit for the period. Partially offsetting these factors is the impact of higher auction sales and lower salaries and related costs.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales in the third quarter have historically represented only approximately 7%-10% of annual Auction Sales, and the third quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, third quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
For the first nine months of 2008, consolidated sales (aggregate auction sales, private sales and dealer revenues) were a record $4.1 billion, up 7% from the prior period. Operating revenues in the period were $525.4 million, a $46.6 million, or 8%, decline from the prior period largely due to a higher level of principal activities losses, lower private sale commissions and lower auction commission margins. The lower commission margins are attributable to a change in sales mix, an increase in risk reduction strategies employed to lower auction guarantee risk in response to an uncertain economic environment, as well as increased competition for consignments.
Net income for the first nine months of 2008 was $36.7 million, a $74.0 million, or 67%, decline from the comparable period of 2007 largely due to the aforementioned revenue
2
shortfalls. Also impacting the comparison of the nine month results to the prior years are higher levels of dealer inventory writedowns, sale promotion costs, general and administrative expenses and borrowing costs, as well as the impact of a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower salaries and related costs. Diluted earnings per share was $0.56 for the first nine months of 2008, a $1.13 decrease from the prior period figure of $1.69.
"At this period of worldwide economic turmoil, we are very pleased to note that our liquidity is very strong and that our auction commission margins held steady at 15% in the quarter," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive officer of Sotheby's. "And, as
we have seen throughout the quarter in our auctions around the world, demand for great works of art remains solid, especially for works that are of great quality, fresh to the market and soberly estimated. We saw this in Paris in early October when the Levy Collection brought over the high estimate when it fetched $17 million, in London in the sale of 20
th
Century Italian Art which brought $24 million, with 90 percent of the lots selling and in Hong Kong, where our Modern and Contemporary South East Asian Paintings sale was 50% over its high estimate. This was also evident in New York this week where we sold three paintings for over $30 million, each setting the auction record for the artist. Malevich's
Suprematist Composition
achieved $60 million, the highest price achieved at auction this autumn, Munch's
Vampire
brought $38.2 million and Degas'
Danseuse au repos
brought $37 million. That evening sale brought a total of $223 million, closely comparable to the $235 million achieved in the same sale just this past May.
"It is hardly surprising, however, that our business is not immune from the unprecedented global economic turbulence which has impacted so many other businesses," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "Our auctions this autumn were assembled over the summer when the world was a very different place and predictably we are now seeing a softening in a number of markets, particularly where there has been a big price appreciation. There is a new reality and consignors will need to adjust their expectations accordingly.
"These third quarter figures reflect a significant level of losses on our guarantee portfolio principally for fourth quarter sale events including this week's $10 million Impressionist guarantee losses as well as our estimate of $17 million on probable guarantee losses in next
3
week's Contemporary sales. We have reduced our guarantee position by 52% as compared to last year and our net guarantee exposure is $114 million. In this period of considerable economic instability, we will dramatically reduce the guarantees and other special concessions we grant to sellers in order to achieve a more balanced and equitable return for our services.
"We will also continue to aggressively review and challenge our level of expenses across the board. We plan to implement a global cost cutting initiative that we expect will lead to significant cost savings across our organization. We expect to take restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of this year as well as the first quarter of 2009. The restructuring plan, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, will focus on strengthening our Company through enhanced profitability in the future.
"We are very prudently positioned going forward," Mr. Ruprecht said. "Through reducing guarantee activities, resizing our organization and receiving a level of return from consignors which reflect our services, it is both our expectation and our goal that we will be meaningfully profitable at significantly lower sales levels even during these uncertain times."
Third and Fourth Quarter Sales
In London in July, Sotheby's Contemporary Art sales totaled $242.4 million, a record anywhere for a Contemporary sales series in Europe and close to the pre-sale high estimate of $248 million. The week was highlighted by the sale of Francis Bacon's
Study for Head of George Dyer
for $27.4 million, well in excess of the pre-sale high estimate of $16 million.
Sotheby's July Old Masters sales in London brought $117.3 million, above the pre-sale high estimate of $105.5 million and 32% above the prior year's total. The top lot of the sales was a re-discovered portrait by Frans Hals of Willem van Heythuysen which sold for $14.0 million. Auction records were set for nineteen artists and twenty lots sold for $1 million or more.
Also in London, on September 15
th
and 16
th
, Sotheby's was privileged to present
Beautiful Inside My Head Forever
, a major auction of new works by Damien Hirst and the first ever staged for the work of a single living artist. The sale brought an outstanding $200.8 million,
4
well in excess of the pre-sale estimate of $122/176 million and the highest total by far for an auction dedicated to a single artist. The over 200 lots in the two day sale were all created for the auction and included
The Golden Calf,
a remarkable new sculpture of a bull in formaldehyde that brought $18.7 million. Forty eight lots were sold for $1 million or more and 74% of the lots sold for more than their high estimate.
Among the sales impacted by the global economic turmoil were Sotheby's Hong Kong October sales which brought $140.7 million, below our pre-sale low estimate of $224 million but still the third highest total ever for a sales series at Sotheby's Hong Kong. Highlighting the sales were works of Chinese Imperial art:
The Emperor Qianlong's Review of The Grand Parade of Troops
sold for $8.7 million, a record for an Imperial Qing dynasty painting; the Imperial white jade
Qianlong Yubi
seal, Qing dynasty, brought $8.1 million and set a record for white jade at auction; and an Imperial jade sabre, which sold for $7.5 million. Chinese works of art brought a total of $58 million over the five-day period. Also, Sotheby's mid-season Contemporary Art evening sale brought $38 million, below the pre-sale low estimate of $52 million. Nevertheless, almost three quarters of the lots sold and only two years ago that sale brought $18.8 million.
Upcoming Sales
On November 11
th
and 12
th
, Sotheby's will hold its fall sales of Contemporary Art in New York. The sales carry a published low estimate of $284 million and include Yves Klein's
Archisponge RE11
, the most significant work in his
Relief Eponge
series from 1960, which is estimated in the region of $25 million. Other highlights include Roy Lichtenstein's
Half Face with Collar
from 1963 (published estimate of $15/20 million) and
Interior with Red Wall
from 1991 (published estimate of $8/10 million), one of the last major series he painted before his death in 1997, as well as works by Lucian Freud, Richard Diebenkorn, Tom Wesselmann and Willem de Kooning.
On November 19
th
in Geneva, the auction of Magnificent Jewels will include the famous emerald cut Lesotho I (published estimate of $3/5 million) which weighs 71.73 carats and was cut by Harry Winston from a spectacular 601-carat rough cut diamond. This is the first time the stone has appeared at auction since it was purchased from Harry Winston in the 1960s by
5
the present owner. Another highlight of the sale is a flawless fancy deep blue 10.48 carat briolette diamond which has a published estimate of $6/9 million. The entire sale has a published estimate of $43/64 million.
In London in the last week of November, sales of Russian art have a published estimate of $47/68 million. The highlight of the evening sale is Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky's
Constantinople and the Bosphorus
(published estimate of $4/5 million) which is one of his most spectacular landscape paintings of his first visit to Constantinople in 1845. Other featured artists are Mikhail Larionov, Vladimir Makovsky and Aristarkh Lentulov.

Item 2.04
Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off Balance Sheet Arrangement
From time to time in the ordinary course of business, Sotheby's (the "Company") will guarantee to consignors a minimum price in connection with the sale of property at auction (an "auction guarantee"). In the event that the property sells for less than the minimum guaranteed price, the Company must perform under the auction guarantee by funding the difference between the sale price at auction and the amount of the auction guarantee. If the property does not sell, the amount of the guarantee must be paid, but the Company has the right to recover such amount through the future sale of the property.
In its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2008, the Company disclosed that it had recognized $17.6 million (pre-tax) of estimated losses in the third quarter of 2008 related to guaranteed property scheduled to be offered in Contemporary Art sales to be held on November 11 and 12, 2008. These estimated losses related to auction guarantees that were entered into on or before September 30, 2008 and were the result of the Company's reevaluation of its estimates in the wake of the recent turbulence in the global financial and credit markets.
As a result of certain guaranteed property failing to sell or selling for less than the minimum guaranteed price in these Contemporary Art auctions, the Company incurred approximately $10.6 million (pre-tax) of principal losses in excess of the $17.6 million in estimated principal losses that were recorded in the third quarter. The incremental $10.6 million in principal losses will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of certain guaranteed property that failed to sell in these Contemporary Art auctions, the Company will own inventory currently valued at approximately $16 million, which had original pre-sale low and high estimates (1) of $24.1 million and $32.7 million, respectively.
As of November 14, 2008, subsequent to the Contemporary Art sales discussed above, the Company has outstanding auction guarantees totaling $13.5 million, the property relating to which has pre-sale low and high estimates (1) of $14.7 million and $19.4 million, respectively. The property related to such auction guarantees is being offered at auctions in December 2008 and the first half of 2009.
In light of the current uncertainty in the global economy and volatility in the financial markets, the Company expects to continue to substantially reduce its use of auction guarantees until stability is restored in the global economy and financial markets. (See statement on Forward Looking Statements.)

Pre-sale estimates are not always accurate predictions of auction sale results.
Item 8.01
Other Events

Item 2.04
Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off Balance Sheet Arrangement
On February 7, 2003, Sotheby's (or the "Company") sold the land and building located at 1334 York Avenue, New York, N.Y. (the "York Property") to an affiliate of RFR Holding Corp. ("RFR") and entered into an agreement to lease it back from RFR for an initial 20-year term, with options for the Company to extend the lease for two additional 10-year terms.
On January 11, 2008, the Company entered into a contract to reacquire the York Property from an affiliate of RFR for an aggregate purchase price of $370 million (the "Purchase and Sale Agreement"). The Company intends to finance the purchase price through the assumption of an existing $235 million mortgage on the York Property and the remaining balance of $85 million through available cash resources. On April 28, 2008, the Company received conditional approval from the lenders to assume the York Property mortgage obligation. The mortgage loan matures on July 1, 2035, with an optional pre-payment date of July 1, 2015, and bears an annual rate of interest of approximately 5.6%, which increases subsequent to July 1, 2015. It is the Company's current intention to pre-pay the mortgage on or about July 1, 2015. The Company made an initial payment to the seller of $50 million on January 11, 2008, which is refundable under certain conditions.
The sale of the York Property was originally scheduled to take place on July 1, 2009, subject to RFR's right under the Purchase and Sale Agreement to accelerate the closing to an earlier date. On November 21, 2008, RFR exercised its right to accelerate the closing, which is now scheduled to take place no later than February 19, 2009.

Item 2.05
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2008, Sotheby's (the "Company") reported that, due to lower current year profitability when compared to 2007, as well as the current uncertain and challenging macroeconomic environment, management expected to initiate global cost reduction initiatives that, if approved by the Company's Board of Directors, would result in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.
On December 1, 2008, the Executive Committee of the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan impacting the Company's North American operations. The actions will result in fourth quarter employee-related restructuring charges of approximately $5 million. Beginning in 2009, the restructuring actions approved in the fourth quarter of 2008 will reduce annual salaries and related costs by approximately $7 million, when compared to 2008 levels.
Management is developing additional global cost reduction proposals that, if approved by the Company's Board of Directors and confirmed through appropriate statutory consultation processes, would result in restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2009.

Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Sotheby's (or the "Company") has a senior secured credit agreement with an international syndicate of lenders arranged by Bank of America Securities N.A. ("BofA") (the "BofA Credit Agreement") that expires on September 7, 2010. The BofA Credit Agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants which, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain quarterly interest and leverage coverage ratios.
On February 4, 2009, as a result of the acceleration by RFR Holding Corp. of the closing date of the Company's purchase of the York Property (see Item 2.01, "Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets," below) and the significant auction guarantee losses that the Company incurred in the second half of 2008, the BofA Credit Agreement was amended to provide for the following:
An increase in the maximum leverage ratio from 3.5 to 4.25 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2009, 4.75 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, 5.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2009 and 3.75 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the maximum leverage ratio reverts to 3.5 for the remaining term of the BofA Credit Agreement.
A one-time adjustment to the calculation of the leverage ratio to exclude certain auction guarantee losses incurred in the second half of 2008.
An increase in the available capacity for repurchases of long-term debt from $20 million to $40 million. (See Item 8.01, "Other Events," below.)
An increase in the interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings, which will now be LIBOR plus a margin between 3.25% and 4.5% determined by reference to the Company's leverage ratio. Prior to this amendment, the interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings was LIBOR plus 1.75%.
A reduction in the total borrowing capacity from $300 million to $250 million. Management concluded that this reduction is appropriate as operating cash flows and cash balances in combination with the lower level of borrowings available under the BofA Credit Agreement are expected to be adequate to meet the Company's anticipated short-term and long-term commitments, operating needs and capital requirements through the September 2010 expiration date. (See statement on Forward Looking Statements.)
As a result of this amendment, the Company incurred one-time upfront fees of approximately $2 million, which will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the BofA Credit Agreement.
Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On February 7, 2003, Sotheby's sold the land and building located at 1334 York Avenue, New York, N.Y. (the "York Property") to an affiliate of RFR Holding Corp. ("RFR") and entered into an agreement to lease it back from RFR for an initial 20-year term, with options for the Company to extend the lease for two additional 10-year terms.
On January 11, 2008, Sotheby's entered into a contract to reacquire the York Property from RFR for an aggregate purchase price of $370 million (the "Purchase and Sale Agreement"). The Company also agreed to give the principals of RFR certain terms for future sales of works of art at Sotheby's auctions. The sale of the York Property was originally scheduled to take place on July 1, 2009, subject to RFR's right under the Purchase and Sale Agreement to accelerate the closing to an earlier date. On November 21, 2008, RFR exercised its right to accelerate the closing, which occurred on February 6, 2009.
The Company financed the purchase price through an initial $50 million cash payment made in conjunction with the signing of the Purchase and Sale Agreement on January 11, 2008, an $85 million cash payment made at closing on February 6, 2009 and the assumption of an existing $235 million mortgage on the York Property, which has an interest rate that is favorable in the current market. The mortgage loan matures on July 1, 2035, with an optional pre-payment date of July 1, 2015, and bears an annual rate of interest of approximately 5.6%, which increases subsequent to July 1, 2015. It is the Company's current intention to pre-pay the mortgage on or about July 1, 2015.
As a result of the closing of the transaction, the existing York Property capital lease obligation of $167 million, which had an effective interest rate of 10.4%, and the related $122 million net capital lease asset, as well as a $16 million deferred gain will be derecognized in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and the net effect will be deducted from the cost recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accordingly, the land and building acquired will be recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at a carrying value of approximately $320 million. Additionally, the Company will recognize the $235 million York Property mortgage obligation in its Consolidated Balance Sheet.
As a result of the closing of the transaction and the assumption of the York Property mortgage obligation, the Company expects net decreases in depreciation expense and interest expense of approximately $2 million and $3 million, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2009, when compared to 2008. The expected net decrease in depreciation expense is principally the result of the difference in depreciable lives between the purchased York Property building and the derecognized York Property capital lease asset. The expected net decrease in interest expense is principally the result of the lower interest rate associated with the assumed York Property mortgage obligation (5.6%) when compared to the derecognized York Property capital lease obligation (10.4%) .
(See statement on Forward Looking Statements.)
Item 8.01
Other Events
On December 23, 2008, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $19 million of its $150 million aggregate outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes (the "Senior Notes"), due June 15, 2015, for a purchase price of $10.5 million (representing 56% of the aggregate principal amount). This repurchase resulted in a non-cash gain of approximately $8 million, which will be reflected in the Company's results for the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, the Company will realize annual interest expense savings of approximately $1.5 million beginning in 2009.
On January 27, 2009, the Company repurchased an additional $2.8 million of its Senior Notes for $1.6 million (representing 59% of the aggregate principal amount). This repurchase resulted in a non-cash gain of approximately $1.1 million, which will be reflected in the Company's results for the first quarter of 2009.
Management will continue to monitor the market for its Senior Notes and may purchase additional bonds opportunistically, as and when pricing is favorable, subject to the $40 million limitation imposed by the BofA Credit Agreement.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     
On February 26, 2009 Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.

Sotheby's earnings press release for the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Press Release New York
 
February 26, 2009, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2008.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported operating revenues of $166.2 million, a $179.6 million, or 52%, decrease from the fourth quarter of 2007. This deterioration is primarily due to a 46% decline in net auction sales from $1.9 billion to $1.0 billion, significant auction guarantee losses and inventory writedowns, all attributable to a downturn in the international art market that began in September 2008, and which resulted from a weakening global economy, as well as turbulence in the global financial and credit markets. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported an operating loss of ($0.7) million and a net loss of ($8.5) million, or ($0.13) per share compared to operating income of $141.6 million and net income of $102.4 million, or $1.55 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2007. This decline is largely due to the aforementioned revenue decreases as well as a $13.2 million impairment loss in the Company's Dealer segment related to goodwill and intangible assets and $4.3 million in restructuring charges. Partially offsetting the impact of these factors is a $44.4 million, or 45%, decrease in salaries and related costs over the period primarily due to a $26.7 million, or 75% decline in accrued incentive bonus costs as a result of the much lower profitability
of the quarter as compared to the prior period. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income*, which excludes the $13.2 million impairment loss as well as the $4.3 million in restructuring charges, is $16.8 million*.
For the full year 2008, consolidated sales (aggregate auction sales, private sales and dealer revenues) were $5.3 billion and operating revenues were $691.6 million, representing decreases from the prior year of 14% and 25%, respectively, primarily due to the previously mentioned sales decline, auction guarantee losses and inventory writedowns experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net income for the full year 2008 was $28.3 million, a $184.9 million, or 87%, decrease from the prior year largely due to the fourth quarter revenue shortfalls. Also contributing to the decreased profitability is a lower level of private sale commissions, higher borrowing costs and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by lower salaries and related costs.
As discussed above, in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $4.3 million related to headcount reductions in its North American operations. Additionally, in 2009, the Company will record approximately $9 million in further restructuring charges for employee-related charges ($6 million), as well as lease exit and facilities-related costs ($3 million). Following the full implementation of the North American and European restructuring plans in the first quarter of 2010, management expects to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $17 million in salaries and related costs, resulting from a 15% reduction in global headcount, and approximately $4 million in savings for facilities-related costs. In addition to this restructuring plan, management is implementing a number of other cost savings initiatives impacting all areas of expense. As a result, management has targeted annual savings in 2009 of approximately $100 million versus actual 2008 results. This $100 million savings target includes any 2009 savings resulting from the North American and European restructuring plans discussed above.
"The global economic crisis which erupted in the autumn of 2008 had a major impact on our business in the fourth quarter," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Sotheby's. "For the first nine months of 2008, our aggregate auction sales were at record levels. But from October onwards, virtually every auction around the world experienced declines. As a result, we immediately took steps to strengthen our business. We began a worldwide restructuring, initiated global cost cutting measures and dramatically curtailed the use of guarantees. To date in 2009, auction commission margin is 17.3%, up 27% from the 13.6% in the first quarter of 2008.
"We continue to make strategic investments in our business," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "Earlier this month, we successfully completed the repurchase of our flagship facility in New York City. We acquired the building for $370 million, funding a significant portion of the purchase price by assuming the seller's mortgage. Replacing our lease obligation which had a 10.4% interest rate with a mortgage obligation of 5.6% allows us to save approximately $4 million in cash interest expense in 2009. This is the premier auction facility in the world and a strategic asset and we are delighted to own it once again. And we remain committed to our focus on our top clients and on the high end of the business. Sotheby's sold the top lot of the year, Francis Bacon's
Triptych, 1976,
($86.3 million), the top lot of the autumn auction season, Kazimir Malevich's
Suprematist Composition
($60.0 million) and the top Contemporary lot of the autumn season, Yves Klein's
Archisponge
($21.4 million) while continuing to reduce lot volume in 2008.
"As we begin 2009 our financial condition remains healthy. We are well-positioned to operate in this very challenging economic environment. And, very importantly, as we saw in our recent London sales, demand remains positive for great works which are well estimated and fresh to the market. In a turbulent world, art continues to represent both value and relevance."
Year to Date 2009 Sales
In New York, the Old Masters Paintings sale in January totaled $63.9 million and was highlighted by JMW Turner's
The Temple of Jupiter Panellenius
which sold for $13.0 million, the second highest price for the artist at auction. Another highlight was Hendrick
ter Brugghen's
Bagpipe Player in Profile
which sold for $10.2 million, surpassing the pre-sale estimate of $4/6 million and setting a record for the artist at auction.
The London Impressionist and Modern Art and Contemporary Art sales earlier this month brought a total of $98.9 million for the week of sales  in line with the pre-sale low estimate of $100 million for the series. The top lot at any auction house was sold at Sotheby's, Edgar Degas'
Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans,
for $19 million, a record for Degas sculpture at auction. Highlighting the Contemporary Art sales was Lucio Fontana's
Concetto Spaziale
which brought $6.4 million. The sell through rate for the week of sales was a robust 85%.
Upcoming Sales
On March 18
th
and 19
th
, Sotheby's will hold its inaugural series of sales in Doha, Qatar. The four sales of Contemporary Art, Orientalist Art, Islamic Art and Watches are estimated to realize a total of $25/34 million over the two-day period. Highlighting the sales is the
Pearl Carpet of Baroda
which was commissioned by the Maharaja of Baroda. Bidding on this exceptional piece will start around $5 million but is expected to rise considerably higher. Leading the Contemporary Art sale is Andy Warhol's
Round Jackie
, a poignant image of Jackie Kennedy based on a news photograph taken of her while she was still in the White House (pre-sale estimate of $2.5/3.5 million).
Beginning on April 4
th
, Sotheby's will be holding its spring series of sales in Hong Kong. This sales series will mark the inauguration of wine auctions at Sotheby's Hong Kong, in addition to the existing sales of Modern and Contemporary Chinese and Southeast Asian Art, Chinese classical paintings and works of art, jewelry and watches. Highlighting the sales is one of the most precious and rarest Tang dynasty artifacts that has ever come on the market, a
Magnificent Large Tortoiseshell Octagonal Box and Cover Inlaid with Mother-of-Pearl
that has a pre-sale estimate in excess of $5 million. Over 1,700 lots with a total pre-sale low estimate of $82 million will be on offer.
Earlier this month, the finest private library of Hebrew books and manuscripts in the world, the Valmadonna Trust Library, was on view in Sotheby's galleries. 10,000 visitors came to Sotheby's New York to view the remarkable collection which stirred such excitement that on the final day of the exhibition there were lines around the block. The collection includes the only surviving manuscript written in England before the expulsion of the Jews in 1290; arguably the finest copy of the Babylonian Talmud produced between 1519 and 1523 by famed printer Daniel Bomberg, which was previously in the collection of Westminster Abbey; as well as the preeminent group of Hebrew books in existence from the dawn of printing (15th century). Sotheby's has been asked to sell the entire library privately to a single buyer, with an estimated price at more than $40 million.

Amendment of William F. Ruprecht Employment Arrangement
     
On March 23, 2009, Sothebys (the Company) and William F. Ruprecht, the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer, agreed to an amendment (the Amendment) of Mr. Ruprechts employment arrangement to reduce Mr. Ruprechts annual base salary by $100,000, from $700,000 to $600,000, effective April 1, 2009. The Amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this filing. This salary reduction was initiated by Mr. Ruprecht as part of the Companys ongoing cost reduction efforts, and he waived his right to receive certain benefits under his employment arrangement as a result of the salary reduction. Mr. Ruprechts employment arrangement became effective on March 31, 2006 and will expire on March 31, 2011.
     
Mr. Ruprechts voluntary salary reduction is consistent with the following steps taken by the Companys Compensation Committee (the Committee), with Mr. Ruprechts encouragement, to ensure that Mr. Ruprechts compensation in respect of 2008 performance was consistent with the Companys reduced profitability in 2008:
Executive Officer Salary Reductions; Related Employment Agreement Amendments
     
Effective May 1, 2009, as part of the Company's ongoing cost reduction initiatives, the Committee determined that the annual base salaries of each of the Company's Named Executive Officers, or NEOs, would be reduced by 10%. The NEOs, who will be named in the Company's 2009 Proxy Statement, have orally agreed to this salary reduction. Certain NEOs have existing severance or other compensation agreements with the Company that will require a written amendment to effect the salary reduction. To the extent required, the Company will file those amendments once they are finalized.

Re:
Employment Arrangement
Dear Bill:
     
The Compensation Committee (the Committee) has considered your request to amend your employment arrangement with the Company, dated March 31, 2006 (as amended, the Arrangement), to reduce your base salary by $100,000, from $700,000 to $600,000. After discussion, the Committee has authorized Sothebys (the Company) to enter into this amendment to the Arrangement to reflect this reduction. Additional amendments to the Arrangement are necessary to conform it to the Companys Amended and Restated Restricted Stock Unit Plan, which now permits the award of restricted stock units. As you know, your February 2009 stock award was in the form of restricted stock units, and it is anticipated that future stock awards will be in that form rather than in restricted stock. No change is being made to any previously granted stock award.
Waivers
     
The Arrangement permits you to terminate your employment with the Company for Good Reason (as defined in Exhibit D to the Arrangement) for the Companys failure to (i) pay an annual base salary of $700,000 to you, or (ii) award you at least $1,400,000 in restricted stock prior to March 31 in any year during the Term (as defined in the Arrangement). You agree to waive irrevocably the right to terminate the Arrangement and any other rights you may have
under the Arrangement as a result of the salary reduction. You further agree that no portion of the salary reduction is being deferred to any future date. In addition, you agree to waive your right to receive any stock award in the form of restricted stock and agree to accept any such award, including your February 2009 grant, in the form of restricted stock units.

Item 2.05
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 4, 2008 and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, Sotheby's (or the "Company") reported that, due to the downturn in the global economy and international art market, its Board of Directors had approved restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 impacting its Auction segment in North America, the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") and Continental Europe, as well as certain corporate departments. These restructuring plans (collectively, the "2008 Restructuring Plan") are the result of a strategic review of the Company's operations initiated by management in the fourth quarter of 2008. The 2008 Restructuring Plan is resulting in a 15% decrease in global headcount, the reduction in Sotheby's selling activities in Amsterdam and the vacating of certain premises in connection with a reorganization of Sotheby's European sourcing network.
In March 2009, in response to the continuing downturn in the global economy and the international art market, management initiated a further strategic review of its operations and on April 27, 2009, the Executive Committee of Sotheby's Board of Directors approved another restructuring plan (the "2009 Restructuring Plan") impacting all areas of the Company's global operations with the goal of additional significant cost reductions to be achieved through a further 5% reduction in global headcount. The 2009 Restructuring Plan will result in employee-related restructuring charges of approximately $5 million, which will be recognized primarily in the second quarter of 2009. In total, the headcount reductions associated with the 2008 Restructuring Plan and 2009 Restructuring Plan will result in aggregate annual cost savings of approximately $24 million, with approximately $15 million expected to be realized in 2009.
In addition to the 2008 Restructuring Plan and 2009 Restructuring Plan, management is implementing a number of other cost savings initiatives impacting all areas of expense. For example, management is implementing pay reductions for certain senior staff, unpaid furloughs for employees in most operating locations and a reduction in U.S. pension contributions. As a result of management's cost savings initiatives (including the 2008 Restructuring Plan and the 2009 Restructuring Plan), management expects to achieve aggregate cost savings of approximately $160 million in 2009 versus 2008, to be achieved in direct costs of services, marketing expenses, salaries and related costs and general and administrative expenses. A portion of the expected savings is the result of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates versus 2008 and a lower expected volume of auction sales.
The current $160 million in targeted savings represents a $60 million increase from the level of targeted savings disclosed by Sotheby's in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.
See statement on Forward Looking Statements.
Item 5.02
Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 23, 2009, effective May 1, 2009, as part of the Company's ongoing cost reduction initiatives, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined that the annual base salaries of each of the Company's Named Executive Officers, or NEOs, who are named in the Company's 2009 Proxy Statement, would be reduced by at least 10%. Certain of these NEOs have existing severance or other compensation agreements with the Company that were amended on March 23, 2009, as reported in a Form 8-K filed on that date, and April 27, 2009 to effect these salary reductions. Additionally, the Company has confirmed salary reduction arrangements with NEOs who do not have existing severance or other compensation agreements.
See the agreements in "Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits" below.
Item 8.01
Other Events
On April 27, 2009, the Executive Committee of Sotheby's Board of Directors decided to reduce the Company's indicated annual dividend rate from $0.60 per share to $0.20 per share, a 67% reduction. The revised rate is expected to apply to the next regularly-scheduled quarterly dividend. As a result of this reduction, on an annualized basis, dividend payments are expected to decrease from approximately $41 million to approximately $14 million. Management believes that this is an appropriate decision in response to the current economic environment. Management will continue to assess the Company's quarterly dividend based upon future operating results and capital requirements.

Re:
Amendment to Severance Agreement
Dear Bill:
     
I write further to your conversation with Bill Ruprecht earlier this month to confirm what we have agreed with you in relation to your remuneration going forward in response to current challenges facing Sotheby's business in a difficult economy. As you are aware, Sotheby's highly compensated executive employees are being asked to have their salary reduced as part of the Company's initiatives to best position the organization to address these challenges. Accordingly, upon your execution of this amendment to your Severance Agreement, which is dated as of August 3, 2006, as amended March 7, 2008 (the "Agreement"), your base salary will be reduced from $600,000 to $540,000 effective May 1, 2009. This amendment is as follows:
Waivers
     
The Agreement permits you to terminate your employment with the Company for "Good Reason" (as defined in Exhibit A to the Agreement) for the following pertinent or potentially pertinent reasons (i) "failure by the Company to pay you a base salary of not less than $600,000"or (ii) "any action by the Company that results in a material diminution in your position without your express consent. . .". You agree to waive irrevocably the right to terminate the Agreement and assert a separation for "Good Reason" along with any other rights you may have under the Agreement as a result of this salary reduction. You further agree that no portion of the salary reduction is being deferred to any future date.
Amendments
     
The Company will review these salary reductions in twelve months with the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to determine if business conditions warrant the reinstatement of all or part of the salary decrease.
     
The Company is making arrangements with most of its benefits providers (other than worker's compensation, short term disability, the Company's 401(k) plan and the Company's Deferred Compensation plan) so that your level of benefits will remain commensurate with the amount of your former base salary of $600,000.
     
Except as amended hereby, the Agreement remains in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
 
     
We greatly appreciate that you are accepting a reduction in compensation during this period of retrenchment for the company's business in a difficult worldwide economic environment.
     
If this letter agreement correctly states the terms of your waivers and the amendments to the Agreement, please acknowledge where indicated below.

Dear Robin
I write further to your conversation with Patrick Van Maris earlier this month to confirm what we have agreed with you in relation to your remuneration going forward in response to the current challenges facing Sotheby's business in this difficult economy. As you are aware, Sotheby's highly compensated executive employees are being asked to agree to have their salary reduced effective 1 May 2009 as part of the Company's initiatives to best position the organisation to address these challenges.
Your employment agreement dated 15 August 2006, as amended 7 March 2008, ("the Agreement") is therefore further amended with effect from 1 May 2009 as follows:
We are also considering the possibility of requiring all members of staff to take a period of unpaid leave. This is subject to consultation with a wider population and we will write to you again when and if we do go down that route.
Except as amended hereby, the Agreement remains in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
We will review these reductions to salaries in twelve months with the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to determine if business conditions warrant the reinstatement of all or part of the salary decrease.
We greatly appreciate that you are accepting a reduction in compensation during this period of retrenchment for the Company's business in a difficult word-wide economic environment.
If the above accurately sets out the understanding I should be grateful if you would sign below and return to me the enclosed copy of this letter.
Yours sincerely

Dear Bruno:
     
As you are aware, business conditions in this unprecedented economic environment are requiring Sotheby's to take an unprecedented step. We are asking our most highly paid executive employees around the world to agree to a salary reduction. This decision is essential to best position the organization at this difficult time and it will help us to save jobs that we would otherwise not be able to retain. But it is one we make with great reluctance. We wish it were not necessary and fully recognize this will be a financial sacrifice for you.
     
Effective May 1, 2009, your annual base salary will be reduced from $550,000 to $495,000. We will review these salary reductions in twelve months (on or about April 1, 2010) with the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to determine if any changes can be made.
     
We are also making arrangements with most of our benefit providers, so that your level of benefits will remain commensurate with the amount of your former base salary of $550,000. Further, in the event that, while you are receiving this reduced salary, you become eligible for payment of insurance, severance, notice (from the Company) or other benefits, such benefits to the extent their calculation depends on your base salary will be calculated using your former higher, base salary amount of $550,000. However, workers' compensation, short term disability, the Company's 401(k) plan and the Company's Deferred Compensation plan and notice from you of your intent to resign will need to be based on your reduced salary.
     
Nothing herein modifies the "at will" nature of your employment subject to the terms of your Notice and Non-Compete Agreement.
 
     
Your support during this challenging period for our business is very important to Sotheby's and is greatly appreciated. It is this effort that will help us to save jobs that otherwise we would not be able to retain.
 
 
ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO:

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     
On May 8, 2009, Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2009. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release New York
May 7, 2009, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, the Company reported operating revenues of $54.4 million, a $74.8 million, or 58%, decrease from the first quarter of 2008. This decrease is primarily due to a 71% decline in net auction sales attributable to the downturn in the global economy and its impact on the international art market that began in September 2008. Partially offsetting this decline is a 560 basis point, or 41%, increase in auction commission margin to 19.2% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 13.6% in the prior period as a result of the Company's revenue enhancement strategies, impact of the buyer's premium increase that was implemented in June 2008 and a change in sales mix. Net loss for the first quarter of 2009 is ($34.5) million, or ($0.53) per share compared to a net loss of ($12.4) million, or ($0.19) for the prior period. This decrease is largely due to the aforementioned net auction sales decline and partially offset by a $37.5 million, or 25%, reduction in operating expenses. This expense improvement is attributable to management's cost reduction initiatives, a lower level of net auction sales and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market and Sotheby's sales calendar, first and third quarters are expected to be loss quarters. First quarter Auction Sales have historically represented approximately 9% - 14% of annual Auction Sales. As a result, typically, first quarter results have not been indicative of expected full year results and we caution investors, as always, to assess the business in six and twelve month periods.
Late last year, the Company announced restructuring plans for the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. In March and April of this year, in response to the continuing downturn in the global economy and the international art market, management initiated an additional strategic review of its operations and on April 27
th
, another restructuring plan was approved impacting all areas of the Company's global operations. In total, the headcount reductions associated with these restructuring plans will result in aggregate annual cost savings of approximately $24 million and a 20% reduction in global headcount, with approximately $15 million expected to be realized in 2009. In addition to the restructuring plans, management is implementing a number of other cost savings initiatives impacting all areas of expense which together are expected to result in cost savings of over $160 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The current $160 million in targeted savings represents a $60 million increase from the $100 million level of targeted savings previously disclosed. This $160 million savings target includes savings from the restructuring plans discussed above.
On April 27, 2009, the Executive Committee of Sotheby's Board of Directors decided to reduce the Company's indicated annual dividend rate from $0.60 per share to $0.20 per share, a 67% reduction. The revised rate is expected to apply to the next regularly-scheduled quarterly dividend. As a result of this reduction, on an annualized basis, dividend payments are expected to decrease from approximately $41 million to approximately $14 million, representing $27 million in cash savings. Management believes that this is an appropriate decision in response to the current economic environment and will continue to assess the Company's quarterly dividend based upon future operating results and capital requirements.
"Sotheby's first quarter results demonstrate an aggressive response to the ongoing global uncertainty, with costs down 25% and margins up 41%," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "The dynamics of the business are shifting dramatically, positioning us for strong future earnings power when the market rebounds, with more limited downside."
Mr. Ruprecht continued: "It has been encouraging to see that demand remains positive for great works of art which are well estimated and fresh to the market. We have seen this play out a number of times this spring in all our key locations, most recently in New York over the
2
last two days. We had two major goals for our evening sale of Impressionist and Modern Art  that we would do a good job for our sellers and that the sale would be profitable. We achieved both. Very importantly for the market, 80% of the lots sold on Tuesday evening, our highest sell through rate in two years. In the day sale that followed, the sell through rate of 87% was the highest in ten years. And very specifically, over the last few days we have earned revenues of $13 million, an 18% margin. This is our most profitable result in New York since last spring when our Impressionist and Modern Art sales totals were more than three times as large but brought a margin of only 8%. High sell through rates and profitable sales show the power of our business model and opportunity for the future. The message is clear. At the right price levels, there is a very solid market for great works of art."
Second Quarter Sales
Earlier this week, Sotheby's New York sales of Impressionist and Modern Art totaled $84.4 million with a strong 85% sell through rate for the series, the highest sell through rate for the category in New York in two years. The evening sale was highlighted by Piet Mondrian's which brought $9.3 million, well above the pre-sale high estimate of $5 million. A new auction record was set for Tamara de Lempicka's
Composition in Black and White, with Double Lines
Portrait de Marjorie Ferry
and other highlights were by Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Camille Pissarro.
Last month, the week long series of sales in Hong Kong brought $88.5 million, well above the pre-sale low estimate of $79 million. Highlighting the sales were a single owner wine sale which went 100% sold and brought well above the pre-sale high estimate, a successful sale of eight Imperial treasures from a European Collection and strong results for Chinese Paintings and 20
th
Century Chinese Art. The overall sell through rate for the week was a robust 85%.
Upcoming Sales
Next week, the Contemporary Art sales take place in New York with a pre-sale estimate of $80/$112 million. Highlighting the sales is Jeff Koons'
Baroque Egg with Bow (Turquoise/Magenta)
, a large sculpture that is modeled after a chocolate Easter egg and is the centerpiece of his "Celebration" series which focuses on toys, presents and other childhood
3
objects. The work has a pre-sale estimate of $6/$8 million. Other featured works are by Robert Rauschenberg, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Martin Kippenberger and Robert Gober.
Next week in Geneva, the Magnificent Jewels sale will include an important and rare fancy vivid blue, internally flawless, cushion shaped diamond weighing 7.03 carats. The diamond, which was cut from a 26.58 carat rough diamond, was discovered in 2008 at Petra Diamonds' historic Cullinan diamond mine in South Africa. The pre-sale estimate of the diamond is $6/$9 million and the buyer will have the honor of naming the diamond. The total sale has a pre-sale estimate of $27/$40 million.
On May 21
st
in New York, the American Paintings sale is highlighted by Childe Hassam's
Paris, Winter Day
, a depiction of the bustling French capitol on a snowy day (pre-sale estimate $1.5/2.5 million). Other notable works are by John Singer Sargent, Anna Mary Roberston Moses, Andrew Wyeth and Winslow Homer. The entire sale is estimated to bring $17/$25 million.
Sotheby's biannual sale of Russian Works of Art in London on June 10
th
will feature the two largest vases ever offered for sale at Sotheby's estimated at $2/$3 million and formerly in the collection of Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich - the son of Tsar Nicholas II's first cousin.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Sotheby's has a senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders arranged by Bank of America Securities N.A. ("BofA") (the "BofA Credit Agreement") that expires on September 7, 2010. The BofA Credit Agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants which, among other things, require Sotheby's to maintain certain quarterly interest coverage and leverage ratios, as defined.
In its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2009, Sotheby's disclosed that, due to the continued downturn in the global economy and the international art market, it was likely that Sotheby's would not meet certain of the financial covenants in the BofA Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2009. Sotheby's also disclosed that management had commenced discussions regarding waivers and/or amendments to the BofA Credit Agreement, which would allow Sotheby's to meet its financial covenants.
Effective June 26, 2009, the BofA Credit Agreement was amended to provide for the following:
A waiver of the leverage ratio covenant for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, September 30,
2009 and December 31, 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the leverage ratio covenant will revert to
current levels for the remaining term of the BofA Credit Agreement.
A waiver of the interest coverage ratio covenant for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009,
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the interest coverage
ratio covenant will revert to current levels for the remaining term of the BofA Credit Agreement.
The addition of a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio. For the twelve months ended June
30, 2009, September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, the consolidated senior secured leverage
ratio (as defined below) may not exceed 2.50:1.00.
The addition of a minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant. Consolidated EBITDA may not be
less than: (x) $47 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, (y) ($36 million) for the
quarter ended September 30, 2009, and (z) $85 million for the quarter ended
December 31, 2009.
An increase in the interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings, which will now be LIBOR
plus a margin of 5.5%. Prior to this amendment, the interest rate charged on outstanding
borrowings was LIBOR plus a margin between 3.25% and 4.5%, determined by reference to
Sotheby's leverage ratio.
An increase in commitment fees on undrawn amounts available under the BofA Credit Agreement,
which will now be 0.875% per annum. Prior to this amendment, the commitment fees on undrawn
amounts were between 0.625% and 0.875%, determined by reference to Sotheby's leverage ratio.
A reduction in the total borrowing capacity from $250 million to $150 million.
A borrowing base equal to 85% of eligible loans (as defined below) made by Sotheby's in the U.S.
and the U.K., plus 15% of Sotheby's inventory in the U.S. and the U.K. Prior to this amendment,
the borrowing base was equal to 100% of eligible loans, as defined, made by Sotheby's in the U.S.
and the U.K. plus 15% of Sotheby's net tangible assets.
As defined in the amendment:
"Consolidated senior secured leverage ratio" means the ratio of (a) consolidated funded
indebtedness (excluding indebtedness secured by mortgages on Sotheby's York Avenue Property)
as of such date that is secured by a lien on Sotheby's assets to (b) consolidated EBITDA for the
most recently completed measurement period.
"Eligible loans" means, notes made in favor of, or loan advances made by, Sotheby's or any of its
subsidiaries in connection with their lending and financing activities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the following notes and loan advances shall not be considered "eligible loans": (a) any
note or loan advance to the extent that such note or loan advance is secured by a lien on collateral
located outside the U.S. or the U.K., (b) any note or loan advance to the extent that such note or
loan advance exceeds a loan to value ratio of 60%, (c) any non-accrual note or loan advance, (d)
any note or loan advance where the obligor's obligation to pay is subject to a good faith dispute or
under litigation, (e) any unsecured note or loan advance, (f) any note or loan advance where the
obligor thereon is an employee, (g) any note or loan advance with a final maturity date longer than
one and one half years from the date of calculation, and (h) any note or loan advance that is
subject to a lien other than any lien created in connection with the BofA Credit Agreement.
As a result of this amendment, Sotheby's incurred upfront fees of approximately $1.5 million, which will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the BofA Credit Agreement, which runs through September 2010.
Management believes this amendment will not have a material adverse impact on Sotheby's operating flexibility. Management also believes that operating cash flows, cash balances and borrowings available under the BofA Credit agreement, as amended, will be adequate to meet Sotheby's anticipated short-term and long-term commitments, operating needs and capital requirements through the September 2010 expiration of the BofA Credit Agreement. Additionally, management has commenced discussions with other lenders regarding a new revolving credit facility with an expiration date beyond September 2010 that would replace the BofA Credit Agreement. While management believes that a long-term revolving credit facility will be available to Sotheby's, as disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2009 management and its advisors also believe that the issuance of certain equity-linked securities (e.g., common or preferred stock) may also be available to Sotheby's as an additional source of capital and liquidity. (See statement on Forward Looking Statements.)

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     
On August 4, 2009, Sotheby's (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release New York  
August 4, 2009, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the second quarter and first six months ended June 30, 2009.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the Company reported operating revenues of $167.3 million, a $152.8 million, or 48%, decrease from the prior period. This decrease is primarily due to a 66% decline in net auction sales attributable to the downturn in the global economy and international art market. Partially offsetting this decline is a 620 basis point, or 41%, increase in auction commission margin, from 15.1% in the second quarter of 2008 to 21.3% in the current period, as a result of the Company's revenue enhancement strategies and a change in sales mix. Also positively impacting revenues is a $10.8 million reduction in principal activities losses over the period due to the significant level of auction guarantee losses in the prior period. Sotheby's has substantially reduced its use of auction guarantees for sales occurring in 2009 and expects to continue to significantly limit its use of auction guarantees for the foreseeable future.
Net income for the second quarter of 2009 is $12.2 million, or $0.18 per share, compared to $95.3 million, or $1.41 per share, for the prior period. This decrease is largely due to the
aforementioned revenue decline and is partially offset by a $50.3 million, or 30%, reduction in operating expenses. Excluding restructuring charges in 2009 and a non-recurring benefit recorded in 2008, the reduction in operating expenses is $73.5 million*, or 39%*, from the prior second quarter. This expense improvement is attributable to management's cost reduction initiatives as well as a lower level of net auction sales during the period.
For the first six months of 2009, operating revenues totaled $221.7 million, a $227.7 million, or 51%, decline from the prior period, and net loss was ($22.3) million, or ($0.34) per share, compared to net income of $82.9 million, or $1.23 per share, for the prior period. This decline is primarily due to a 51% decline in first half operating revenues, attributable to a 67% decline in net sales over the period, and is partially offset by a 28% reduction in operating expenses in the first half of 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges in 2009 and a non-recurring benefit recorded in 2008, the reduction in operating expenses is $116.6 million*, or 35%*, from the prior year.
"With auction commission margins up 41% and costs down 39%* (excluding restructuring charges in 2009 and a non-recurring benefit recorded in 2008), Sotheby's second quarter results demonstrate Management's response to the global economic turbulence of 2008," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive of Sotheby's. "The 620 basis point improvement in auction commission margin to 21.3% for the second quarter brought an incremental $39.3 million or 24% of total revenues for the period, a very significant increase. We adjusted quickly to the different and difficult environment that suddenly presented itself and we are very well positioned to capitalize on a market rebound and benefit from our improved margins and lower costs."
Mr. Ruprecht added: "The steady improvement in sell through rates by lot since November has been another positive indicator. In Impressionist and Modern Art, those rates in our evening sales went from 64% (November) to 81% (May) to 85% (June) and from 68% (November) to 81% (May) to 93% (June) for Contemporary Art. These figures and the 46% increase in second quarter private sales to $134 million show active participation at new price levels and give confidence to consignors and to buyers alike that there is now a more stable marketplace.

"We are on track to achieve the $160 million in cost savings in 2009 as compared to 2008 as announced last quarter. These substantial savings, as well as a new three year $150 million revolving credit facility that we expect to close with GE Capital later this month (subject to the conditions in the GE Capital commitment letter), have us on solid ground for the future."
Sotheby's summer fine arts sales in London in late June brought $132.0 million, near the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $144 million and with a high sell through rate of 86% for the series. The Impressionist and Modern Art sales brought $75.8 million and were highlighted by the sale of Pablo Picasso's for $11.5 million, the highest price of the London summer sales season for any auction house. London's Contemporary Art sales totaled $56.2 million and were highlighted by the sale of Andy Warhol's 1963 painting for $6.1 million, above the pre-sale low estimate of $5.8 million.

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Credit Agreement
     
On August 31, 2009, in order to obtain longer term financing with a more flexible covenant package, Sotheby's and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively the "Borrowers"), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with General Electric Capital Corporation ("GE Capital"), as Agent, GE Capital Markets, Inc. and HSBC Bank PLC as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, and the lenders named therein (collectively, the "Lenders"). In connection with the entry into the Credit Agreement, Sotheby's terminated its senior secured revolving credit facility agented by Bank of America, N.A. (the "BofA Credit Agreement"), as discussed in Item 1.02 below.
     
The following summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the Credit Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. Terms used, but not defined, in this Form 8-K have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.
     
The Credit Agreement provides for a $200 million revolving credit facility to the Borrowers (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), with a sublimit of $50 million for borrowings by the U.K. Borrowers (as defined below). Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, and may be made from time to time until maturity on August 31, 2012. Up to $10 million of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used to issue letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are limited by a borrowing base, which is equal to 85% of Eligible Art Loans (as defined below), plus 30% of Eligible Art Inventory (as defined below, but subject to a maximum amount of $50 million), plus 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined below, but subject to a maximum balance of $20 million), subject to certain reserves. As of August 31, 2009, the borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was $136 million, as calculated under the borrowing base.
     
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are available in either Dollars (to Borrowers located in the United States ("U.S. Borrowers")) or Pounds Sterling (to Borrowers located in England ("U.K. Borrowers")). Borrowings shall, at the Borrowers' option, be either Dollar Index Rate Loans (for U.S. Borrowers only) or LIBOR Loans. Dollar Index Rate Loans bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (a) the highest of (i) the "Prime Rate" as quoted in
The Wall Street Journal
, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate
plus
3%, or (iii) the LIBOR Rate plus 1.0%,
plus
(b) the Applicable Margin, as defined in the Credit Agreement and which is generally 3.0% to 3.5% based upon the level of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The LIBOR Rate for Dollars or Sterling, as the case may be, for an Interest Period is equal to (x) the highest of (i) the offered rate for deposits in such currency for a period equal to such Interest Period on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, (ii) if the Interest Period is less than three months, the offered rate for deposits in such currency on the Reuters Screen for an Interest Period of three months, and (iii) 2%, plus (y) the Applicable Margin, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and which is generally 4.0% to 4.5% based upon the level of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
     
The Borrowers have the right to prepay loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time prior to maturity. If the Borrowers prepay or terminate the Revolving Credit Facility prior to the second anniversary of the closing, the Borrowers shall pay a fee of 1% if the prepayment occurs prior to the first anniversary or .50% if the prepayment occurs after the first anniversary and prior to the second anniversary. The Credit Agreement also includes certain mandatory prepayment provisions with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility in the event of dispositions of property or other events that result in certain net cash proceeds.
     
The U.S. Borrowers and, subject to certain limitations, the U.K. Borrowers, are jointly and severally liable for all obligations under the Credit Agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Borrowers guaranty the obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on all or substantially all of the personal property of the Borrowers and the guarantors.
     
The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants. Affirmative covenants include: furnishing to the Lenders periodic financial information of Sotheby's and its subsidiaries; paying and discharging, at or before maturity, material obligations and liabilities; preservation of legal existence and corporate identity; maintenance of properties; compliance with all laws and regulations; maintaining proper insurance coverage; maintenance of books and records; limitations on capital expenditures; limitations on net outstanding auction guarantees and limitations on the use of proceeds from the credit extensions. Negative covenants include: limitations on the creation of liens, limitations on the incurrence of other indebtedness and making certain investments; and limitations on the ability to merge, liquidate, consolidate, dispose of assets or capital stock, and materially change the nature of the business. The Credit Agreement restricts quarterly dividend payments to the lesser of $0.05 per share or $4 million. The maximum level of quarterly dividend payments may be increased depending on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant.
     
The Credit Agreement contains the following financial covenants, which are only applicable during each Financial Covenant Compliance Period (as defined below):
A minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined below) covenant. Under this financial covenant,
Sotheby's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may not be less than (a) 1.00 to 1.00 for the twelve month
period ending December 31, 2009, (b) 1.05 to 1.00 for the twelve month period ending March 31, 2010
and (c) 1.15 to 1.00 for the twelve month periods ending as of the last day of any fiscal quarter subsequent to March 31,
2010.
A minimum EBITDA (as defined below) covenant. Under this financial covenant, Sotheby's
consolidated EBITDA may not be less than (a) $60 million for the twelve month period ending
December 31, 2009, (b) $65 million for the twelve month period ending March 31, 2010, (c) $75
million for the twelve month periods ending June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010, (d) $80 million
for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2010 and (e) $100 million for the twelve month
periods ending as of the last day of any fiscal quarter subsequent to December 31, 2010.
     
The Credit Agreement also includes events of default (with customary grace periods), including: nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts when due; violations of covenants; inaccuracies of representations and warranties; cross-defaults; a material misstatement in any borrowing base certificate, the occurrence of certain insolvency proceedings; certain judgments; certain ERISA events; invalidity of loan documents; the occurrence of a Change of Control; and failure of collateral documents to create a lien.
     
Sotheby's incurred total fees related to the Credit Agreement of approximately $7 million, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the three-year term of the facility. Additionally, commitment fees of 1.00% per annum will be charged to Sotheby's for undrawn amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility.
     
Sotheby's believes that operating cash flows, cash or any short-term investment balances and borrowings available under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet its anticipated short-term and long term commitments, operating needs and capital requirements for the next twelve months and through the expiration of the Credit Agreement. (See statement on Forward Looking Statements.)

                    (b) To induce Lenders to provide the LIBOR Loan option on the terms provided herein, if (i) any LIBOR Loans are repaid in whole or in part prior to the last day of any applicable LIBOR Period (whether that repayment is made pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or occurs as a result of acceleration, by operation of law or otherwise); (ii) any Borrower shall default in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Loan; (iii) any Borrower shall refuse to accept any borrowing of, or shall request a termination of, any borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of, LIBOR Loans after Borrower Representative has given notice requesting the same in accordance herewith; (iv) any Borrower shall fail to make any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan after Borrower Representative has given a notice thereof in accordance herewith; or (v) any assignment shall occur pursuant to , then Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Lender from and against all losses, costs and expenses resulting from or arising from any of the foregoing. Such indemnification shall include any loss (excluding loss of margin) or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate deposits from which such funds were obtained. For the purpose of calculating amounts payable to a Lender under this subsection, each Lender shall be deemed to have actually funded its portion of the relevant LIBOR Loan (or its participation interest in such LIBOR Loan) through the purchase of a deposit bearing interest at the Dollar LIBOR Rate or the Sterling LIBOR Rate, as applicable, in an amount equal to the amount of such portion of such LIBOR Loan (or such participation, as applicable) and having a maturity comparable to the relevant LIBOR Period; , that each Lender may fund each of its interests in LIBOR Loans (or its participations in LIBOR Loans) in any manner it sees fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this subsection. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder. As promptly as practicable under the circumstances, each Lender shall provide Borrower Representative with its written calculation of all amounts payable pursuant to this , and such calculation shall be binding on the parties hereto unless Borrower Representative shall object in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt thereof, specifying the basis for such objection in detail.

Furthermore, so long as any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Credit Party shall provide Agent and each Lender with access to their suppliers and customers to the extent such access is within the rights and powers of such Credit Party. Each Credit Party shall make available to Agent and its counsel reasonably promptly originals or copies of all books and records that Agent may reasonably request. Each Credit Party shall deliver any document or instrument necessary for Agent, as it may from time to time reasonably request, to obtain records from any service bureau or other Person that maintains records for such Credit Party, and shall maintain duplicate records or supporting documentation on media, including computer tapes and discs owned by such Credit Party.

Similarly, a Lender shall notify Agent promptly on becoming so aware in respect of any payment to that Lender pursuant to any Loan Document. If Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall promptly notify the Borrower Representative.
                              (iii) Subject to below, if a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by any Credit Party, the amount of the payment due from such Credit Party shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.
paragraph (iv)

                              (vii) A Treaty Lender shall, if so requested by Borrower Representative (on behalf of the U.K. Credit Parties), as soon as reasonably practicable, complete and file with the appropriate tax authority an application for authorization by that tax authority to make that payment without a Tax Deduction. The Borrower Representative (on behalf of the U.K. Credit Parties) shall, thereafter, be responsible for dealing with such authority in relation to the processing of such application (and the Treaty Lender shall provide such cooperation as is reasonably necessary to complete any further procedural formalities required to obtain authorization).
                              (viii) A U.K. Non-Bank Lender shall promptly notify Agent who shall notify the U.K. Credit Parties if there is any change in the position from that set out in the Tax Confirmation.

                              (C) a Treaty Lender.
If a New Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this , then such New Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each U.K. Credit Party) as if it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies Agent which category applies (and Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Borrower Representative on behalf of the U.K. Credit Parties). For the avoidance of doubt, an Assignment Agreement shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this .

                              (ii) that Lender has obtained, utilized and retained that Tax Credit, the Lender shall pay an amount to the applicable Credit Party which that Lender determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by such Credit Party.
                    (d) . The Credit Parties shall pay, and within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Lender against any cost, loss, or liability that a Lender incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of the Loan Documents.

by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to Agent), pay to Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost.

Each Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after it becomes aware of any circumstances referred to above which would result in any such increased cost, the affected Lender shall, to the extent not inconsistent with such Lender's internal policies of general application, use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize costs and expenses incurred by it and payable to it by Borrowers pursuant to this .

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower Representative may revoke any Notice of Revolving Credit Advance or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If Borrower Representative does not revoke such notice, Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by Borrower Representative, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by Borrower Representative, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Index Rate Loans.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrowers shall not have the right to obtain a Replacement Lender if the Affected Lender rescinds its demand for increased costs or additional amounts within 15 days following its receipt of Borrowers' notice of intention to replace such Affected Lender. Furthermore, if Borrowers give a notice of intention to replace and do not so replace such Affected Lender within ninety (90) days thereafter, Borrowers' rights under this shall terminate with respect to such Affected Lender and Borrowers shall promptly pay all increased costs or additional amounts demanded by such Affected Lender pursuant to .

If, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Agent or any Lender shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any applicable laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or the like, each Borrower hereby consents to such action by Agent or such Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by Agent or such Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of subrogation that each Borrower might otherwise have had but for such action by Agent or such Lender. Any election of remedies that results in the denial or impairment of the right of Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower's obligation to pay the full amount of the Secured Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Borrower. In the event Agent or any Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale permitted by law or the Loan Documents, Agent or such Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Secured Obligations and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Agent or such Lender but shall be credited against the Secured Obligations.

Press Release New York
September 1, 2009
, Yesterday, Sotheby's entered into a senior secured credit agreement with an international syndicate of lenders arranged by GE Capital and HSBC Bank, PLC (the "2009 Credit Agreement"). The 2009 Credit Agreement is available through August 31, 2012 and provides for borrowings of up to $200 million. The 2009 Credit Agreement was oversubscribed and closed at $50 million more in capacity than previously disclosed in Sotheby's 10-Q filed on August 6, 2009 due to a high level of investor interest. Borrowings under the 2009 Credit Agreement generally bear interest equal to LIBOR (subject to a 2% floor) plus a margin between 4.00% and 4.50%, based upon the level of outstanding borrowings.
"This new credit facility is a very positive development," said Bill Ruprecht, Sotheby's President and Chief Executive Officer. Our previous agreement with Bank of America was due to expire in September 2010 and this new three year agreement provides a longer term solution with more flexible covenants and borrowing base as well."
"We previously disclosed in conjunction with the announcement of our second quarter earnings that we were about to enter into a $150 million three year revolving credit facility with GE Capital. The increase to $200 million is a direct result of the higher level of interest from the syndicate of lenders and is a clear endorsement of Sotheby's credit," said Bill Sheridan, Sotheby's Chief Financial Officer.
For additional details about the 2009 Credit Agreement, please refer to the 8-K that will be filed today and can be found online at

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          On November 5, 2009, Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
          (c) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
November 5, 2009, New York - -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2009, Sotheby's reported revenues of $44.9 million, a $31.0 million, or 41%, decrease from the prior period. This decrease is primarily due to an 80% decline in net auction sales attributable to the movement of the summer London Contemporary Art sales from the third quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009 (net sales of $208 million in the third quarter of 2008), the absence of the prior year's Damien Hirst single-owner sale in London (net sales of $176 million in the third quarter of 2008) as well as the impact of the downturn in the global economy which continued to negatively impact sales across most collecting categories. The lower level of third quarter revenues is partially offset by a 750 basis point, or 49%, improvement in auction commission margin, from 15.2% in the third quarter of 2008 to 22.7% in the current period, as a result of management's revenue enhancement strategies and a change in sales mix. Also positively impacting revenues is a $45.5 million reduction in principal activities losses over the period due to the significant level of auction guarantee losses in 2008 that did not recur in the current quarter. The Company continues to significantly limit its use of auction guarantees.
Operating loss for the third quarter of 2009 is ($38.3) million, a $19.1 million, or 33%, improvement when compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $50.1 million, or 38%, reduction in expenses, driven by the Company's cost reduction initiatives and a lower level of net auction sales during the period. Also contributing to the operating loss improvement is the previously mentioned reduction in principal activities losses.
Net loss for the third quarter of 2009 is ($57.8) million, or ($0.89) per share, compared to ($47.0) million, or ($0.73) per share, for the prior period. This decrease is largely due to the aforementioned decrease in operating revenues, as well as a higher income tax provision in the current period resulting in expense of $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to a benefit of $21.2 million in the prior year.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales in the third quarter have historically represented only approximately 7%-10% of annual Auction Sales, and the third quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, third quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, net loss was ($80.1) million, or ($1.23) per share, compared to net income of $35.8 million, or $0.53 per share, in the prior year. This decline is primarily due to a 49% decrease in revenues, attributable to a 70% decline in net sales, as well as a significant increase in the Company's effective income tax rate. The lower level of current year results are partially offset by a $137.8 million, or 31%, reduction in expenses during the first nine months of 2009, as well as $51.5 million in auction guarantee losses recognized in the prior year that were not repeated in 2009. Excluding restructuring charges in 2009 and a non-recurring benefit recorded in 2008, adjusted total expenses decreased $167.2 million*, or 36%*, when compared to the prior year.
Bill Sheridan, Chief Financial Officer of Sotheby's explained: "The unusual effective tax rate for both periods continues to be caused by the mix of our earnings and losses amongst
2
Sotheby's domestic and overseas operations, deferred tax valuation allowances, as well as the exaggerated impact of non-deductible expenses in an environment of lower full year results over the periods. We anticipate the effective tax rate will be less volatile in future years as earnings return to more normalized levels."
"The art market is clearly in a better place than it was last autumn and the early spring of this year," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive of Sotheby's. "We see this in improved consignments, improved results, improved sell through rates and improved confidence and these are all very encouraging indicators.
"Before taxes, our third quarter loss actually improved by 31%, from ($68.7) million a year ago to ($47.1) million in 2009," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "Additionally, we are on track to exceed the cost savings of $160 million in 2009 as compared to 2008, a target we committed to when the economic shocks of last fall reverberated around the world and severely impacted our business. We have also continued our focus on revenue enhancement strategies as evidenced by the continued increase in auction commission margins to 22.7% in the third quarter of 2009. This is a 49% increase from the prior period and brought an incremental $9.7 million or 22% of total revenues for the period.
Mr. Ruprecht continued: "In the second half of 2009 to-date, net auction sales have averaged a significantly higher percentage of presale low estimates as compared to results in the first half of this year, and a number of our sales thus far this fourth quarter have had especially successful results. Our Hong Kong sales last month brought $167 million, at the pre-sale high estimate, and well above the same series last year. Almost two thirds of our auctions in October have come in at or above the pre-sale high estimate and just this week our Russian sale in New York brought $13.8 million and our evening sale of Impressionist and Modern Art in New York totaled $181.8 million, both significantly above their high estimates.
"The results from last night's Impressionist and Modern Art sale are remarkable and a clear vote of confidence for the art market. Bidding was fiercely competitive driving 64% of the lots sold to exceed their high estimates. Throughout the year, we have consistently seen an
3
enormous appetite for works of great quality and yesterday's results were a clear testament to that trend."
Third and Fourth Quarter Sales
This week, Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art evening sale in New York brought an outstanding $181.2 million, above the high estimate of $163.6 million  the first time since May 2006 that an Impressionist and Modern Art sale in New York exceeded the pre-sale high estimate  and with a strong lots sold percentage of 85%. The sale was led by Alberto Giacometti's beautiful sculpture which brought $19.3 million, well above the pre-sale estimate of $8/$12 million. Five works sold for more than $5 million and two records at auction were achieved, each significantly surpassing its high estimate  Andr Derain's brought $14.1 million against the pre-sale estimate of $6/$8 million and Kees Van Dongen's brought $13.8 million against the pre-sale estimate of $7/$10 million.

In October, Sotheby's fall Hong Kong sales brought $167.1 million, at the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $123/$167 million, with virtually every auction exceeding pre-sale expectations and both wine sales 100% sold. This was the third highest total ever for a series of sales at Sotheby's Hong Kong and 88% above the spring 2009 series total. Highlighting the series was the Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art sale which brought $54.5 million and included a world record at auction for any Chinese Furniture, from the Qianlong period, which sold for $11 million (pre-sale estimate of $3/$4 million).
An Outstanding Imperial Carved Zitan "Dragon" Throne
In London last month, Sotheby's Contemporary Art and 20 Century Italian Art sales brought a combined $32.8 million, near the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $25/$35 million. The top lot of the sales was Jean Michel-Basquiat's for $1.6 million and seven new artist records were achieved during the sales.

Earlier this week in New York, Sotheby's Russian Art sale brought a strong $13.8 million, well above the pre-sale high estimate of $9.7 million. The highlight of the sale was a rare

portrait of Peter the Great which sold for an extraordinary $1.3 million, many multiples of its estimate of $80,000/$120,000.
Last month, Sotheby's fall sale of Important Jewels in New York exceeded the pre-sale high estimate of $12.3 million, bringing $13.8 million. The star of the sale was a pear-shaped 29.53 carat D-color, potentially flawless, type IIa, diamond ring, which brought a total price of $3.5 million, well above the pre-sale estimate of $1.8/2.2 million and over $118,000 per carat.
Upcoming Sales
Next week, Sotheby's New York will hold its Contemporary Art series which has a combined pre-sale estimate of $99/$142 million and is highlighted by Andy Warhol's (estimate of $8/$12 million) which is from his first series of silkscreen paintings and has not been seen in public since Sotheby's sale of the Estate of Robert C. Scull in 1986. Other highlights include David Hockney's , Jasper Johns' and Willem de Kooning's (estimates of $5/$7 million each).

Performance Share Units.
          At its February 9, 2010 meeting, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), adopted a performance share unit, or PSU, award program and form of performance share unit agreement for named executive officers, or NEOs, and other executives pursuant to which PSUs were awarded on that date. The form of PSU agreement is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1. William F. Ruprecht, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, received an award of PSUs on that date that is subject to different termination provisions from those awards issued under the form of PSU agreement described above. Mr. Ruprecht's PSU agreement is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.The Company is issuing these awards pursuant to its existing Restricted Stock Unit Plan.
          A brief summary of key terms of the PSUs is included below. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2. . All initially capitalized terms used in the summary below have the meanings given to those terms in the PSU agreement as noted.
Time and Performance Vesting Features of PSUs
          Each PSU awarded entitles the recipient to receive one share of the Company's common stock upon the fulfillment of time and performance vesting criteria. Subject to achieving the performance vesting target, each PSU award will vest in four equal installments over a four year period. In order to vest over this period, certain confidential pre-tax earnings targets established by the Committee must be met for each of the four potential vesting dates. In addition, partial achievement of the performance target for a particular vesting date will result in the recipient receiving a percentage of the total number of PSUs that could vested on that date as follows:
Recapture and Rollover Features of PSUs
          If a target is not fully achieved on a particular vesting date, unvested PSUs may still vest if the target is exceeded on a future vesting date. Any unvested PSUs remaining at the end of the four year vesting period may also vest under certain circumstances, depending on the level of achievement of the cumulative four year target. To the extent the pre-tax earnings target is exceeded for a particular vesting date, the amount of excess pre-tax earnings will be credited towards meeting the targets for future vesting dates.
Dividend and Voting Rights
          Dividend equivalents on unvested PSUs will accumulate whenever the Company pays dividends on its Common Stock, but the PSU holder will not receive payment of the underlying dividends until the vesting of the PSUs. Unvested PSUs do not have any voting rights.
Termination of Employment
          Upon retirement, a recipient's unvested PSUs will vest for the year in which retirement occurs, to the extent that the time and performance vesting criteria for the award are achieved for that year. Upon death or disability, a recipient's unvested PSUs will continue to vest to the extent that the time and performance vesting criteria of the award are achieved in or after the year in which death or disability occurs.
          In Mr. Ruprecht's case, if any of the following events occurs, his unvested PSUs will also vest in the same manner as they would in case of death or disability:
Cancellation of Certain Unvested Restricted Stock Awards in Exchange for PSU Awards.
     At its February 9, 2010 meeting, the Committee also approved the cancellation of 53,681 and 38,344 shares of unvested restricted stock subject to performance as well as time vesting criteria granted on July 13, 2006 to NEOs William S. Sheridan, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Robin G. Woodhead, the Company's Executive Vice President, and Chairman of Sotheby's International as well as a Company director, respectively. In place of the cancelled awards, Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Woodhead have each agreed to accept the Committee's award at its meeting of 40,000 PSUs and 29,000 PSUs respectively. The Company has reported these transactions on a Form 4- Statement of Changes of Beneficial Ownership timely filed for each of them with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 11, 2010.
Waiver by Mr. Ruprecht
          Mr. Ruprecht's employment arrangement with the Company requires that he receive restricted stock or restricted stock units in certain amounts annually. If the Company fails to do so, Mr. Ruprecht may terminate his employment arrangement for "Good Reason" (as such term is defined in the arrangement). On February 9, 2010 pursuant to a written waiver, Mr. Ruprecht waived his Good Reason termination rights and agreed to accept PSUs instead of the required amounts of restricted stock or restricted stock units. A copy of this waiver is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.3.
Elimination of Certain NEO Base Salary Reductions.
          In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2009, the Company disclosed the reduction of the base salaries of the Company's NEOs by at least ten percent (10%), effective May 1, 2009. On February 11, 2010, the Company determined that certain NEOs' full base salary would be reinstated, effective as of February 1, 2010 for Mr. Ruprecht (whose salary reduction had been effective one month prior to that of the other NEOs) and effective as of March 1, 2010 with respect to certain other NEOs: William F. Sheridan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Bruno Vinciguerra, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mitchell Zuckerman, Chairman of Sotheby's Financial Services, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company. The fully reinstated base salaries are as follows: Mr. Ruprecht  $700,000; Mr. Sheridan  $600,000; Mr. Vinciguerra  $550,000; and Mr. Zuckerman  $535,000.

          (c) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 10.1.
          THIS AGREEMENT, entered into effective as of the ___ day of ____________ between SOTHEBY'S, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and ________________________________ (the "Participant").
           the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") has established the Sotheby's Restricted Stock Unit Plan, as amended (the "Plan") in order to provide employees of the Corporation with an opportunity to acquire shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, as an inducement to remain in the service of the Corporation or a Subsidiary and to promote the Participant's commitment to the success of the Corporation during such service.
WHEREAS,
           Section 6.2 of the Plan provides that the Corporation may grant Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Awards subject to attainment of performance goals ("Performance Share Units" or "PSUs"), as determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.
WHEREAS,
           the Board has determined that it would be in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders to award Performance Share Units with financial performance objectives which appropriately address corporate operating and retention objectives, foster a long term focus on the Company's business and align management with shareholder interests.
WHEREAS,
           the Board has approved the award of ____ Performance Share Units to Participant subject to the execution of this Agreement.
WHEREAS,
           it is agreed as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE,
           The terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan. The Plan is hereby incorporated in and made an integral part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. In the event of any inconsistency between any provision of the Plan and any provision of this Agreement, the provision of the Plan shall prevail unless the Agreement states that it is intended to differ from the Plan as authorized thereby with respect to a specific issue. The Participant hereby acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Plan and agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.
1.
.
Definitions and Incorporation
           Pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation hereby grants to the Participant effective February 9, 2010, an award of _______ Performance Share Units. If vested, each Performance Share Unit will be payable in one share of Common Stock of the Corporation.
2. .
Award of Performance Share Units
           The Performance Share Units will be eligible for vesting based upon annual achievement of the Corporation's 2010 pre-tax earnings threshold of $_________________ (the "Annual Target"). Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Annual Target is extremely confidential and subject to the provisions of Participant's confidentiality agreement with the Corporation.
3. .
Performance Objectives and Vesting
          (a) . Pending satisfaction of the performance requirements, Performance Share Units will vest ratably, 25% each year, over a four year period as follows:
Performance Share Units Eligible for Vesting Each Year
          The Annual Target will be used to determine the actual Performance Share Unit level of vesting for each year in the four year vesting period listed above. The Vesting Date shall also be the payment date. Registration in the Participant's name in book entry form of the shares of Common Stock underlying vested Performance Share Units will occur within ninety (90) days of the payment date.
          (b) . The annual vesting calculation will be based on the Corporation's actual pre-tax earnings for the calendar year preceding the Vesting Date (the "Performance Period"). The eligible Performance Share Units will vest at three possible vesting levels of pre-tax earnings achievement in accordance with the following schedule:
Vesting Percentage Based on Pre-Tax Earnings Achievement
          (c) . If the Annual Target is not fully achieved in any of the first three Performance Periods, the unvested Performance Share Units will rollover to the next year and, if applicable, each subsequent year in the four year vesting period, on the following basis:
Rollover of Unvested Units and Rollover of Excess Pre-Tax Earnings or Loss
          (i) If the actual pre-tax earnings required for 50% vesting is not achieved, the pre-tax earnings achieved will be rolled over to the next year (or a subsequent year in the four year vesting period) and will count towards achievement of the Annual Target for that year.           (ii) If the actual pre-tax earnings for a year exceed any of the vesting levels, any pre-tax earnings in excess of the applicable vesting level will be rolled over to the next year (or a subsequent year in the four year vesting period) and will count towards achievement of the Annual Target for that year.
           (iii) If the Corporation incurs a loss (i.e. no actual pre-tax earnings) in any year of the vesting period, the amount of the loss will carry over to subsequent years in the vesting period. The amount of the loss will be subtracted from the actual pre-tax earnings for those years to determine whether the Annual Targets have been partially or fully achieved.
          (iv) To recapture any unvested Performance Share Units in subsequent years, the pre-tax earnings in those subsequent years (including any rollover pre-tax earnings or loss) must exceed the Annual Target for the year by the cumulative shortfall between the pre-tax earnings credited towards vesting and the total Annual Targets to date ("Cumulative Credited Earnings Shortfall"). The number of units recaptured shall be determined using the vesting calculation set forth in Section 3(b) but in no event can a Participant exceed the cumulative performance share units eligible for vesting in the schedule set forth in section 3(a).            (v) After calculating the 4 vesting period using the forgoing criteria, the participants will have a further opportunity to recapture all or some of the unvested units at the end of the 4 Performance Period. This opportunity will be available if any pre-tax earnings (including any rollover earnings from prior periods) have not been used to achieve any vesting level over the 4 Performance Periods ("Excess Earnings"). When this situation applies, the participant will receive a pro-rated number of units determined as follows: The total number of remaining unvested units multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the amount of such Excess Earnings and the denominator of which shall be the Cumulative Credited Earnings Shortfall, if any.

Please refer to Exhibit A attached to this Agreement for examples of how this Award may vest as described in this Section.
           Except as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee or required by applicable law, the Participant shall not have the right to vote the underlying shares of stock subject to a Performance Share Unit Award until the Performance Share Units have vested and the shares have been delivered to the Participant as provided in Section 6.3 of the Plan. The Participant will have the right to receive dividend equivalents on unvested Performance Share Units with respect to the equivalent number of shares underlying the Performance Share Unit

Voting and Dividend Rights
Award. Such dividend equivalents will accrue throughout the vesting period of the Award but will only be paid to the Participant as the Performance Share Units vest. Dividend equivalents, to the extent they are accrued and payable, shall be paid no later than ninety (90) days after the Vesting Date. Such dividend equivalents shall be taxed to the Participant in accordance with applicable law. All distributions, if any, received by the Participant with respect to Performance Share Units awarded herein as a result of any stock split, stock distributions, combination of shares, or other similar transaction shall be subject to the restrictions of the Plan and this Agreement.
           Except as specifically provided in Sections 6 and 7 below, in the event a Participant separates from service prior to 100% vesting, the Participant's rights with respect to Performance Share Units which are not vested shall be forfeited immediately and permanently. The Participant shall not be entitled to claim any compensation or indemnification of any kind whatsoever on the basis of said forfeiture.
5.
.
Termination of Employment
          In the event a Participant separates from service due to Retirement as defined in the Plan, if the performance requirements associated with the Participant's Performance Share Units are achieved for the year in which the Participant retires, the Participant shall vest in the percentage of Performance Share Units eligible for vesting in accordance with the time vesting and performance criteria set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement. Any excess pre-tax earnings for the year of Retirement shall not roll over to a subsequent year in the vesting period. It is intended that this Section of this Agreement shall control instead of the automatic vesting in Section 7.3 of the Plan upon Retirement of the Participant.
6. .
Retirement of a Participant
           In the event a Participant separates from service due to death or Disability as defined in the Plan, if the performance requirements associated with the Participant's Performance Share Units are achieved in or following the year in which death or Disability occurs, the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary shall vest in the percentage of Performance Share Units eligible for vesting in accordance with the time vesting and performance criteria set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement for those remaining vesting periods. It is intended that this Section of this Agreement shall control instead of the automatic vesting in Section 7.3 of the Plan upon death or Disability of the Participant.

The Performance Share Units will be eligible for vesting based upon annual achievement of the Corporation's 2010 pre-tax earnings threshold of $ (the "Annual Target"). Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Annual Target is extremely confidential and subject to the provisions of Participant's confidentiality agreement with the Corporation.
[**]*
          (a)          . Pending satisfaction of the performance requirements, Performance Share Units will vest ratably, 25% each year, over a four year period as follows:
Performance Share Units Eligible for Vesting Each Year
          The Annual Target will be used to determine the actual Performance Share Unit level of vesting for each year in the four year vesting period listed above. The Vesting
Date shall also be the payment date. Registration in the Participant's name in book entry form of the shares of Common Stock underlying vested Performance Share Units will occur within ninety (90) days of the payment date.
          (b)          . The annual vesting calculation will be based on the Corporation's actual pre-tax earnings for the calendar year preceding the Vesting Date (the "Performance Period"). The eligible
Vesting Percentage Based on Pre-Tax Earnings Achievement
          Performance Share Units will vest at three possible vesting levels of pre-tax earnings achievement in accordance with the following schedule:
          (c)          . If the Annual Target is not fully achieved in any of the first three Performance Periods, the unvested Performance Share Units will rollover to the next year and, if applicable, each subsequent year in the four year vesting period, on the following basis:
Rollover of Unvested Units and Rollover of Excess Pre-Tax Earnings or Loss
          (i) If the actual pre-tax earnings required for 50% vesting is not achieved, the pre-tax earnings achieved will be rolled over to the next year (or a subsequent year in the four year vesting period) and will count towards achievement of the Annual Target for that year.
          (ii) If the actual pre-tax earnings for a year exceed any of the vesting levels, any pre-tax earnings in excess of the applicable vesting level will be rolled over to the next year (or a subsequent year in the four year vesting period) and will count towards achievement of the Annual Target for that year.
          (iii) If the Corporation incurs a loss (i.e. no actual pre-tax earnings) in any year of the vesting period, the amount of the loss will carry over to subsequent years in the vesting period. The amount of the loss will be subtracted from the actual pre-tax earnings for those years to determine whether the Annual Targets have been partially or fully achieved.
          (iv) To recapture any unvested Performance Share Units in subsequent years, the pre-tax earnings in those subsequent years (including any rollover pre-tax earnings or loss) must exceed the Annual Target for the year by the cumulative shortfall between the pre-tax earnings credited towards vesting and the total Annual Targets to date ("Cumulative Credited Earnings Shortfall"). The number of units recaptured shall be determined using the vesting calculation set forth in Section 3(b) but in no event can a Participant exceed the cumulative performance share units eligible for vesting in the schedule set forth in section 3(a).

EXHIBIT 10.3
Re:     
Employment Arrangement
Dear Bill:
          The Compensation Committee has considered your request to forego any 2009-related cash bonus compensation and has decided to honor it. In addition, you have asked that your 2010 stock award be awarded in the form of performance share units, notwithstanding the fact that your current employment arrangement (the "Arrangement") calls for you to receive an award of restricted stock units. A waiver from you is necessary to permit the Company to issue you performance share units at the February 9, 2010 Compensation Committee meeting.
          The Arrangement permits you to terminate your employment with the Company for "Good Reason" (as defined in Exhibit D to the Arrangement) for the Company's failure to award you at least $1,400,000 in restricted stock or restricted stock units prior to March 31 in any year during the Term (as defined in the Arrangement). You agree to waive your right to receive any 2010 stock award in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units and agree to accept any such award in the form of performance share units. You further agree that any right to receive dividends in respect of those performance share units shall be governed by the terms of that award.
          If this letter agreement correctly states the terms of your waiver regarding the Arrangement, please acknowledge where indicated below.

On March 1, 2010, Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
March 1, 2010, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009.
Despite a 7% decrease in net auction sales, Sotheby's reported a substantial improvement in fourth quarter 2009 earnings over the prior year fourth quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 is the second highest in Company history at $73.6 million, or $1.09 per share, compared to a net loss of ($9.3) million, or ($0.14) per share, for the prior period. This significant improvement in profitability is especially attributable to a $52.1 million, or 31%, increase in operating revenues from the prior period. This increase is largely due to a 440 basis point, or 28%, improvement in auction commission margin, from 16.0% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 20.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009, resulting from management's revenue enhancement strategies. Also positively impacting revenues is a $19.9 million reduction in principal activities losses over the period due to the substantial levels of prior year auction guarantee losses and inventory writedowns. The Company continues to significantly limit its use of auction guarantees. Fourth quarter results also reflect a $47.5 million, or 28%, reduction in expenses, driven by the Company's cost reduction initiatives.
For the full year 2009, consolidated sales (sum of aggregate auction sales, private sales and dealer revenues) were $2.8 billion and revenues totaled $485.0 million, a $206.6 million, or 30%, decline from the prior year. This deterioration is primarily due to the 54% decrease in net auction sales during the year, attributable to the downturn in the international art market and global economy that began in September 2008. Offsetting this sales decline is a 37% increase in auction commission margin, to 20.7% in 2009 from 15.1% in 2008 as well as a $77.0 million reduction in principal activities losses, due to the substantial prior year guarantee losses. Also significantly mitigating the impact of this sales decline is a $185.3 million reduction in operating expenses, due to the Company's cost reduction initiatives as well as a lower level of net auction sales. Net loss for the full year 2009 was ($6.5) million, or ($0.10) per share compared to net income of $26.5 million, or $0.38 per share, in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of $12.2 million and a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million, there would have been net income of $3.1 million*, or $0.04 per share*, in 2009.
It should be noted that 2009 had an unusual effective tax rate due to the combination of the relative impact of permanent differences on a much lower pre-tax earnings amount, the recording of a valuation allowance against certain state, local and foreign deferred tax assets including loss carryforwards as well as the mix of our earnings and losses amongst Sotheby's domestic and overseas operations. We would anticipate the effective tax rate to be less volatile in future years as earnings return to more normalized levels.
"We are delighted and encouraged by our outstanding fourth quarter, which has produced our second highest fourth quarter net income," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive of Sotheby's. "This remarkable achievement could not have been possible without two driving factors: the strong improvement in auction commission margins and our vigilant focus on costs, which has allowed us to deliver a decrease in operating expenses of $185.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008. We are well poised to capitalize on an economic upturn and art market rebound as it occurs.

"Our worldwide sales last autumn were a significant improvement over their spring equivalents," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "Sell through rates improved virtually across the board and our November sales of Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art both exceeded their pre-sale high estimates. More bidders participated in our Impressionist and Modern Art sales than ever before, confirming that buyers will always be active when there is wonderful property that is fresh to the market and attractively estimated.
"The momentum has continued into 2010. We have just held Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art sales in London which have been among our best ever, with both sales surpassing their high estimates by wide margins. And, memorably, we have just made history at Sotheby's with the sale of Alberto Giacometti's
L'homme qui Marche 1
, which sold for $104.3 million in our Impressionist and Modern Art evening sale, setting the world record price for a work of art at auction. Sotheby's is the only auction house to have sold works at auction above $100 million and the top three works of art sold at auction have now been sold at Sotheby's. (Picasso's sold in 2004 for $104.2 million and Picasso's sold in 2006 for $95.2 million.)
Garon a la Pipe (Boy with a Pipe)
Dora Maar au Chat
"It would have been impossible to imagine these results just one short year ago," concluded Mr. Ruprecht.
Year to Date 2010 Sales
In January in New York, our Old Master Paintings sale led the market and brought $61.6 million, near the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $44/63 million. Twelve works sold for over $1 million led by Van Dyck's
Two Studies of a Bearded Man
which brought $7.3 million and Hendrick Goltzius' which brought $6.8 million. Also in New York in January, our Americana sale led the market with a total of $13.3 million and was highlighted by what is likely the largest piece of early eighteenth century American silver, a punch bowl by Cornelius Kierstede, which was sold for $5.9 million, achieving many multiples of the $400,000/800,000 pre-sale estimate and establishing the record at auction for American silver.
Jupiter and Antiope

Our Impressionist and Modern Art sales in London last month led the market and brought a remarkable $263.6 million (pre-sale estimate of $129/189 million) with the evening sale total of $235.7 million achieving the highest total for any sale ever held in London. Besides the Giacometti sculpture where ten bidders were fiercely competing, another huge success was Gustav Klimt's beautiful landscape
Kirche in Cassone
which sold for $43.2 million, well over the pre-sale estimate and setting a record at auction for a landscape painting by the artist. 22 works, or over two thirds of those sold in the evening sale, sold for $1 million or more.
Last month's London Contemporary Art sales also led the market and brought $103.1 million, well above the pre-sale estimate of $63/88 million. The evening sale included property from Sammlung Lenz Schnberg, a collection of ZERO movement Art assembled by Gerhard and Anna Lenz over a period of 50 years and brought $36.4 million. The top lot of the evening sale was Willem de Kooning's
Untitled XIV
which brought $6.2 million. An outstanding 21 new artist records were set in the evening sale.
Upcoming Sales
Beginning on April 3

APPENDIX B
GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In this release, financial measures are presented in accordance with GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis. All references in this release denoted by * are to "adjusted" non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are not GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as alternatives to Net Loss and and Diluted Loss Per Share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release enables management and investors to evaluate the Company's results from operations in a more meaningful way. Management also utilizes the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release in analyzing the Company's performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the comparable GAAP amounts is included below (in thousands of dollars, except per share amounts).
** The reconciling item is due to a difference in the method of calculating diluted earnings (loss) per share in a period with a net loss as compared to a period with net income. In a period with net income, diluted earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, which is not applicable in a net loss period.

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release New York
May 6, 2010, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Total revenues increased 87% to $101.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 largely due to the $45.0 million, or 117%, increase in auction commission revenues from the prior period. The increase in auction commission revenues was driven by the strong Impressionist and Contemporary Art net auction sales results in London, in February, which increased $208.1 million, or 243% from the prior year. This is partially offset by a 10% decline in auction commission margin from 19.2% to 17.2% because of the change in sales mix towards higher valued items in the quarter, which decreased our buyer's premium rate due to our sliding scale rate structure (there was a 120% increase in the number of lots sold over $1 million, at which point the buyer's premium rate decreases from 20% to 12%). Despite the significant increase in sales volume, operating expenses declined $16.2 million, or 15%, due in part to the absence of certain expenses in 2010 that were incurred in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, the effect of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2009. Net loss for the first quarter was ($2.2) million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, an improvement of 94% from the prior year figure of ($34.5) million, or ($0.53) per diluted share.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, auction sales in the first quarter have historically represented only approximately 7%-15% of annual auction sales, and the first
quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, first quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
"The renewed art market momentum that began last autumn continued into the first quarter and we are delighted with our results," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive of Sotheby's. "The quarter saw an impressive increase in revenues and at the same time, a decrease in operating expenses, leading to a material improvement to our bottom line. We continue to stay focused on auction commission margins, expense control and improved operating results.
"Also positively contributing to these excellent first quarter results is our continued commitment to private sales, with private sale commissions up 79% in the first quarter. Since 2007, we have underwritten almost $1.7 billion in private sales, and we will continue to focus on this valued service to our clients. Private sales are an important source of revenue for our business and a strategic initiative for Sotheby's.
"Last night's Impressionist sale brought outstanding results, more than tripling last year's May sale, surpassing our November total and coming in near the high end of the pre-sale estimate," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "We now look forward to next week's Contemporary sales in New York and a number of exciting sales in London and Europe that will finish out the second quarter.
"We have a strong balance sheet with $215 million of cash at the end of the first quarter, an increase of almost ten times from the prior year, as well as no borrowings under our revolving credit facility," concluded Mr. Ruprecht.
Second Quarter Sales
Last night in New York, our evening sale of Impressionist and Modern Art brought $195.7 million, coming in at the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $141/204 million and 219% above last year's result of $61.4 million. The star of the sale was Henri Matisse's
Bouquet de
2
Fleurs pour le Quatorze Juillet
which brought $28.6 million against the pre-sale estimate of $18/25 million. Another highlight was Claude Monet's
Effet de Printemps  Giverny
which brought $15.2 million, also above the pre-sale estimate of $10/15 million. A strong 88% of the lots were sold and 43 lots, or three quarters of the lots offered, went for $1 million or more.
Last month in Hong Kong, our week long series of sales brought $256 million, surpassing the pre-sale high estimate of $217 million by a wide margin and setting the record for the highest total achieved for a sales series at Sotheby's Hong Kong. Numerous records were set and almost all of the sales exceeded pre-sale high estimates. A white jade Qianlong period seal sold for $12.3 million and an 18th century court pearl necklace brought $8.7 million in the Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art sale (above the pre-sale estimate of $6/8 million and $1/2 million, respectively). And a necklace comprising 50 white diamonds sold for $6.7 million, while a 5.16-carat pear-shaped internally flawless fancy vivid blue diamond, the "DeBeers Millennium Jewel 11" brought $6.4 million, both in the Magnificent Jewels sale (above the pre-sale estimate of $4/5 million and $5/6 million, respectively).
Last month in New York, our Magnificent Jewels sale brought $34.7 million, surpassing the pre-sale high estimate and bringing the second highest total for a various owner Magnificent Jewels sale in New York ever. The top lot of the sale was a 100 carat fancy vivid yellow diamond necklace which brought $3.6 million, above the pre-sale estimate of $2/3 million. Another extraordinary piece was a fancy intense pinkish orange 7.67 carat diamond ring which sold for $3.1 million or $405,019 per carat.
Upcoming Sales
Next week, our Contemporary Art sales take place in New York with a pre-sale estimate of $155/220 million which compares to the prior year's pre-sale estimate of $80/112 million that brought $75.5 million. Highlighting the sales is Mark Rothko's
Untitled
, a large fiery red canvas from 1961 that has a pre-sale estimate of $18/25 million. Also leading the sales is Andy Warhol's
Self Portrait
which is one of a series of five that were completed not long before his death and Brice Marden's
Cold Mountain I (Path)
arguably the most important of his works ever to be sold at auction. Both works have a pre-sale estimate of $10/15 million.
3
Other featured works are by Jackson Pollock, Agnes Martin, Roy Lichtenstein and Willem de Kooning.
Also next week, in Geneva, the Magnificent Jewels sale will include a magnificent emerald-cut white diamond weighing 52.82-carats and a highly important pear-shaped fancy vivid blue diamond weighing 5.02-carats, both of which are set as rings (pre-sale estimates of $7 million and $4/7 million, respectively). There are a number of beautiful white and colored diamonds featured in the auction and the entire sale has a total pre-sale estimate of $34/49 million which compares to the prior year's pre-sale estimate of $28/41 million that brought $35.8 million.
The contents of Albemarle House, the magnificent home of vintner and philanthropist, Patricia Kluge will be offered in a two-day auction, which will take place on June 8
th
and 9
th
, and will be held on the premises, located outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. Mrs. Kluge's collection of several hundred works of outstanding Georgian furniture, decorative objects and paintings is estimated in excess of $13.5 million.
This June we will sell the long lost art trove of the legendary art dealer Ambroise Vollard in London and Paris. Vollard was a Parisian art dealer who played a pivotal role in the development of the Impressionist and Modern art market by representing Picasso, Van Gogh, Renoir and Czanne, among others. The works were found in 1979 in a bank vault at the Socit Gnrale in Paris where they had been deposited during 1939, soon after Vollard's death, by Erich Slomovic, an associate of Vollard's to whom he had consigned the works. Thereafter, Slomovic fled to Yugoslavia where he died at the hands of the Nazis in 1942. As a result, the contents of the vault remained untouched for 40 years. The star of the offerings is a wonderful landscape by Andr Derain,
Arbes  Collioure
, which has a pre-sale estimate of $14/21 million.
Highlighting our July Old Master Paintings sale in London is Turner's amazing masterpiece,
Modern Rome  Campo Vaccino
. The sun-filled panorama is arguably one of Turner's finest depictions of an Italian city and has only come to market once before in its lifetime. The piece was purchased in 1878 by the 5
th
Earl of Rosebery and his wife Hannah Rothschild and
4
has been in the family collection ever since. The painting has a pre-sale estimate of $18/27 million.
In New York on June 21
st
and 22

, Sotheby's will offer Photographs from the Polaroid Collection. The collection includes more than 1,200 works by many of the leading photographers of the second half of the 20th century. Among them are Peter Beard, Chuck Close, William Wegman, David Levinthal, Robert Frank, David Hockney, Robert Mapplethorpe and, perhaps most significantly, Ansel Adams, who is represented by over 400 photographs. The collection is estimated to bring $7.5/11.5 million.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
          On August 5, 2010, the Company issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

August 5, 2010, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the second quarter and first half ended June 30, 2010.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, auction and related revenues improved $118.8 million, or 79%, and $168.4 million, or 86%, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, almost entirely due to an increase in auction commission revenues stemming from strong sales around the world during the period. Total aggregate auction sales were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $2.2 billion in the first half, an increase of 110% and 116%, respectively. Most notably, combined sales of Impressionist and Contemporary Art increased $428 million, or 154%, and $684 million, or 188%, in the second quarter and first half of the year, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase in auction commission revenues is a decline in auction commission margin from 21.3% to 18.7% in the second quarter and from 20.8% to 18.3% in the first half, attributable to the change in sales mix towards higher valued items in both periods. Over $1 million, the buyer's premium rate decreases from 20% to 12%.
Despite the significant increase in auction sales and revenues, operating expenses were well controlled with the increase over the prior year principally due to increased accrued incentive compensation expense as a result of the significant improvement in profitability. Net income for the second quarter was $86.2 million, or $1.26 per diluted share and $84.1 million, or $1.22 per diluted share for the first half (compared to net income of $12.2 million, or $0.18
per share in the second quarter of 2009 and net loss of ($22.3) million, or ($0.34) per share in the first half of 2009). First half net income is the second highest in Company history.
"These are excellent results and are indicative of the improving art market we have been experiencing since last autumn," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive of Sotheby's. "They reflect strong revenues coupled with discipline on the expense side and we will continue to focus on both going forward.
"As we put our autumn sales together, our goal, as ever, is to find the right balance in presenting great works, fresh to the market and attractively estimated, particularly as the global economy remains uncertain," Mr. Ruprecht continued.

On September 2, 2010 Sotheby's, a Delaware corporation, (the "Company"), entered into a new Employment Agreement ("Agreement") with William F. Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer, which replaces Mr. Ruprecht's employment agreement dated March 31, 2006, as amended ("Previous Agreement"), which was scheduled to expire in March 2011. The Agreement is for a four year term ending August 31, 2014 with one year renewals thereafter unless the Company or Mr. Ruprecht provides notice of non-renewal at least five months prior to the end of the term or an annual extension.
Under the new Agreement, Mr. Ruprecht's annual salary will remain at $700,000. Mr. Ruprecht is entitled to an annual cash target bonus of $1,400,000 with maximum payment of 200% of the cash target bonus. He is also entitled to be awarded annual performance share unit ("PSU") grants of a minimum of $3.5 million up to a maximum of $4.5 million in the discretion of the Compensation Committee vesting ratably over four years but contingent upon the attainment of performance goals.
In consideration of foregoing certain benefits under the Previous Agreement, the Agreement provides for a one-time payment to Mr. Ruprecht of $250,000. Such foregone benefits include reimbursement of excise tax related to payments due to Mr. Ruprecht upon a change of control of the Company and the associated tax gross-up, reduced perquisites and elimination of tax gross-up on perquisite payments. The one-time payment is also intended to cover a portion of the legal and consulting fees that Mr. Ruprecht incurred during the course of the contract negotiations.
In the event of the termination of Mr. Ruprecht's employment by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Ruprecht for Good Reason (as the terms Cause and Good Reason are defined in the Agreement), Mr. Ruprecht will be paid $4 million and he and his dependents will receive continued coverage for three years under the Company's medical, dental, vision and life insurance plans. His currently outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards will be fully vested and his PSU awards will continue to vest contingent upon the Company attaining the performance goals.
In the event of termination by the Company for Cause, or termination by Mr. Ruprecht without Good Reason, Mr. Ruprecht will not be entitled to any termination payment or any bonus, whether accrued or not. In the event of death or disability, a $2 million lump sum is payable together with existing entitlements under the Company's life insurance or disability plans and his currently outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards will be fully vested and his PSU awards will continue to vest contingent upon the attainment of performance goals.
Payments to Mr. Ruprecht under the Agreement supersede any payments under the Company's severance plan.
Mr. Ruprecht and the Company have agreed to eliminate the $2 million payment to Mr. Ruprecht provided under the Previous Agreement at the end of its term. At the end of the term of the new Agreement, Mr. Ruprecht and his dependents will continue to be covered for three years under the Company's medical, dental, vision and life insurance plans and his PSU awards will continue to vest contingent upon the Company attaining the performance goals.
The Agreement provides that the Company may, pursuant to Company policy adopted consistent with applicable law, recoup incentive compensation paid to Mr. Ruprecht based on financial statements that are restated.
During his employment and for one year thereafter, Mr. Ruprecht may not compete with the Company, solicit employees to leave the Company's employ or solicit business of the Company's clients. Mr. Ruprecht and the Company also agree to mutual nondisparagement covenants.
Mr. Ruprecht is required to release the Company of all claims in order to obtain his termination of employment benefits. The Company will also release Mr. Ruprecht of all claims except for those based on facts and circumstances of which Mr. Ruprecht is aware at the time of signing the Release and fails to disclose. Mr. Ruprecht has also entered into a Confidentiality Agreement with the Company by which he agrees not to disclose confidential information for two years, except that the obligation to keep client data confidential will be unlimited in duration.

Dear Bill,
          The attached Terms of Employment together with its Exhibits (the "Terms") sets forth our mutual understanding with respect to the terms of your continuing employment by Sotheby's ("Sotheby's" or the "Company") for the period September 1, 2010 through August 31, 2014 and any extended period in accordance with the Terms. With respect to the Terms, you and Sotheby's hereby agree as follows:
          This Letter Agreement and the Terms (collectively, the "Letter Agreement") supersedes any and all existing agreements between you and Sotheby's, including without limitation the Employment Agreement dated as of March 31, 2006, as amended. Concurrently with signing this Letter Agreement, you shall enter into a Confidentiality Agreement with Sotheby's ("Confidentiality Agreement").
          This Letter Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to your benefit and to the benefit of your successors as well as to the benefit of Sotheby's and its permitted successors and assigns. Neither this Letter Agreement nor any of the rights of the parties hereunder may be assigned by either party hereto except that Sotheby's may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a corporation or other entity into which it is merged or that acquires substantially all of its assets. Any assignment or transfer of the Letter Agreement in violation of the foregoing provisions will be void.
          This Letter Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and/or to be performed in that State, without regard to any choice of law provisions thereof.
          Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Letter Agreement or breach (collectively, a "Claim") thereof shall be settled by arbitration in New York City in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding upon both parties, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States or country or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and such enforcement as the law of such jurisdiction may require or allow. The losing party in such arbitration shall be liable for any costs, including attorney's fees. If there is a dispute as to which party lost, or if a party shall have prevailed on one or more but not all of the issues subject to arbitration, costs and fees shall be allocated by the arbitrator.
          If this Letter Agreement correctly sets forth your understanding with Sotheby's regarding the terms of your employment by Sotheby's, please acknowledge your agreement by signing in the space indicated below.
ACCEPTED AND AGREED THE 2ND DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2010:
          The restrictions on 60% of the VCP Shares have lapsed and, subject to the satisfaction of the performance criteria described below, the restrictions on the remaining 40% of the VCP Shares ("Remaining VCP Shares") will lapse on March 31, 2011 (the "2011 Vesting Date"). Restrictions will lapse on the 2011 Vesting Date if either (i) the compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") in Sotheby's common stock, including dividends, shall have been equal to or greater than 7.2% per annum from April 1, 2006 through March 31, 2011 or (ii) the cumulative CAGR of the Company's net income shall have been equal to or greater than 10% through the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with the Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2005. If Executive's employment is terminated prior to the 2011 Vesting Date as a result of a Change in Control, by the Company without Cause, by the Employee with Good Reason, or as a result of Executive's death or Disability, (i) if the performance criteria for the 2011 Vesting Date have already been satisfied as of the date of termination of employment, the restrictions on the Remaining VCP Shares that would otherwise have lapsed on the 2011 Vesting Date will lapse immediately and (ii) if the performance criteria have not yet been satisfied for the 2011 Vesting Date, but have been satisfied for one or more full 12-month periods prior to the date of termination of employment, then the restrictions on a fraction of the Remaining VCP Shares shall lapse immediately, the numerator of such fraction being the number of full 12-month periods for which the performance criteria have been satisfied and the denominator of such fraction being 5, with payment to be made on the 2011 Vesting Date.
          For purposes of measuring the CAGR in Sotheby's common stock, the value of such common stock as of April 1, 2006 shall be the daily average closing price of Sotheby's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the period January 3 through March 31, 2006 and the value of such common stock at the end of each measurement period shall be the daily average of the closing price of Sotheby's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the 30 calendar days prior to the end of such measurement period.
          The cumulative CAGR in the Company's net income for any measurement period will be deemed to be equal to or greater than 10% if (i) the actual cumulative net income (net of any net loss) of the Company for such period equals or exceeds (ii) what the Company's cumulative net income would have been had the CAGR of its net income during such measurement period been 10% as compared with the Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2005.
          For purposes hereof, net income shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"); provided, however, that consistent with the Company's objective to reward Executive based on the normalized operating performance of the Company, the Compensation Committee shall have the discretion to adjust the Company's net income to account for extraordinary or unforeseen
business events or developments during any measurement period, including, but not limited to, income or loss from discontinued operations, gains or losses from the sale of significant assets or business units, restructurings, asset impairments, unusual adjustments to tax valuation reserves, special charges, extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, material changes in GAAP, or other non-recurring events. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment shall increase the amount of compensation otherwise payable if such increase is prohibited by Code Section 162(m).
"Cause" means:
          The Executive shall have thirty (30) days following the receipt of notice from the Company of the existence of circumstances constituting Cause to correct such circumstances to the extent correctable. Any notice of termination for Cause must be given within sixty (60) days following the Chairman of the Board of Directors learning of circumstances constituting Cause. During such thirty (30) day period, the Executive shall be given an opportunity, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board of Directors of the Company and the Executive shall only be deemed to have been terminated for Cause if no less than 60% of the members of the Board of Directors determine in good faith that the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in clauses (1), (2) or (3) above.
"Change of Control" shall have the meaning set forth in the Company's Amended and Restated Restricted Stock Unit Plan.
"Disability" means a determination by the Company in accordance with applicable law that, as a result of a physical or mental illness, the Executive has been unable to perform the essential functions of his job, for a period of at least 90 consecutive calendar days, with or without reasonable accommodation that does not present an undue burden on the Company.
"Good Reason" means:
provided, however, that the Company shall have thirty (30) days following the receipt of notice from the Executive of the existence of circumstances constituting Good Reason to correct such circumstances. Any notice of termination for Good Reason must be given within thirty (30) days following the Executive learning of circumstances constituting Good Reason.
          In consideration of the compensation provided to Executive under this Letter Agreement, and because the Executive has specialized, unique confidential knowledge vital to the Company, the Executive agrees that, during the Restricted Period (defined below), he will not, without the consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, consult for, become employed by, provide services to, or solicit or accept any funds, loans or other consideration from:
          For purposes of this Agreement, the Art Business involves auctions, dealing in or making private sales of, and collecting or advising with respect to, the collecting categories that comprise the Company's core businesses at the time of termination. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Restricted Period" is during the course of the Executive's employment and the period of twelve (12) months after the termination of the Executive's employment.
          In addition to the foregoing, during the Restricted Period, the Executive agrees that he will not, either alone or in concert with others, and will not cause another to in any such case directly or indirectly,
          The term "Client" means any Level 1, 2 or 3 client of the Company as currently referred to by the Company or as such category may be referred to at the time of Executive's termination of employment.
          If at any time there is a judicial determination by any court of competent jurisdiction that the time period, geographical scope, or any other restriction contained in this Exhibit C is unenforceable against the Executive, the provisions of this Exhibit C shall not be deemed void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time period, geographical scope and to such other maximum extent as the court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
          On November 4, 2010, the Company issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
November 4, 2010, New York - -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2010.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2010, Sotheby's reported revenues of $73.1 million, a $28.1 million, or 63%, increase from the prior period. This increase is partially due to the $14.1 million, or 48%, growth in auction commission revenues due to strong worldwide sales, most notably the July London Old Master Paintings sale which brought 85% higher results than the prior year. Also contributing to the rise in third quarter revenues is a $13.2 million increase in dealer revenues due to a higher level of dealer activity in the period. Partially offsetting the overall increase in auction commission revenues is a decline in auction commission margin from 22.7% to 20.2% in the third quarter which is almost entirely attributable to a change in sales mix as a greater number of high valued items were sold in the period. Over $1 million, the buyer's premium rate decreases from 20% to 12%.
Operating loss for the third quarter of 2010 is ($29.1) million, a $9.1 million, or 24%, improvement from the prior period. This is largely due to the aforementioned growth in revenues and is partially offset by a $19.0 million, or 23%, increase in expenses in the quarter. A substantial portion of the increase ($14.0 million of the $19.0 million increase) is attributable to higher dealer cost of sales, which is offset by the increase in dealer revenues
mentioned above. Total expenses, excluding dealer cost of sales, increased $5.0 million, or 6%*, from the prior period.
Net loss for the third quarter of 2010 is ($19.4) million, or ($0.29) per share, compared to ($57.8) million, or ($0.89) per share in the prior period, a 67% improvement. This is largely due to favorable differences in the effective income tax rate, which decreased our net loss by $29.8 million, as well as the aforementioned increase in revenues.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales in the third quarter have historically represented only approximately 7%-10% of annual Auction Sales, and the third quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, third quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, net income is $64.7 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($80.1) million, or ($1.23) per share, in the prior year. This improvement is primarily due to a $189.7 million, or 71%, increase in revenues, largely due to a 113% increase in net auction sales and 87% increase in auction commission revenues attributable to the strengthening of the global art market. The increase in revenues is partially offset by a higher level of accrued incentive compensation costs due to the substantial improvement in current period results, as well as an increase in direct costs of services that is consistent with the level and composition of our auction offerings during the period. Overall, expenses for the first nine months of 2010 were $337.9 million, an 8% increase from the prior period. Total expenses, excluding restructuring charges, increased 12%* in the first nine months of 2010 as compared to the prior period.
"Outstanding auctions in all geographic regions and across nearly all collecting categories have contributed to these excellent results," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "A 63% increase in third quarter revenues coupled with a 67% improvement in net loss, and a $144.8 million increase in nine months net income are
2
significant improvements by any standard and were achieved through strong revenue margins, virtually no principal risk and well-controlled expenses.
"The momentum is strong in the fourth quarter," added Mr. Ruprecht. "Among the many successful sales we have had thus far, our Hong Kong series of sales last month was the unquestioned highlight. The series brought $396.4 million, our best total ever and was 55% above the previous record series that took place in the spring of this year. Whether in Asia, North America or Europe, there is confidence in the art market as we approach the conclusion of this remarkable year.
"Confidence was also clearly in evidence this week with our Impressionist and Modern Art sales in New York. Our sales totaled $263.7 million, up from both our May 2010 and November 2009 sales totals," Mr. Ruprecht continued. "Bidding was fierce on most of the major lots of the sales, demonstrating tremendous strength and demand for works of great quality. Modigliani's masterpiece, which set a new record at auction when it sold above the pre-sale estimate for $69.0 million, was Sotheby's highest price in New York for a work in this category since May 2006."
Fourth Quarter Sales
Sotheby's New York Impressionist and Modern Art sales brought a strong $263.7 million (combined pre-sale estimate of $229/323 million) and 24% above last year's total of $212.7 million. The star of the sales was certainly Amedeo Modigliani's which sold for $69.0 million, four times the price realized when the same piece was sold at Sotheby's in 1999 for a then record of $16.8 million. Other highlights of the sales were Claude Monet's which brought $24.7 million (pre-sale estimate of $20/30 million) and Henri Matisse's which sold for $20.8 million (pre-sale estimate of $12/18 million). Four works sold for more than $15 million and 42 sold for over $1 million.

Last month in Hong Kong, Sotheby's series of sales brought $396.4 million, a record total for any auction house in Hong Kong and far exceeding the pre-sale high estimate of $297. Virtually every sales category exceeded its high estimate as well as its comparable totals
3
achieved in the spring sales series. The week began with Sotheby's ninth consecutive white glove wine sale  without a single unsold lot  with two single-owner sales bringing $13.7 million. Four private collections of Imperial Treasures and Important Chinese Works of Art (pre-sale estimate of $43/61 million), achieved an extraordinary $147.6 million and included the exceptional Qianlong double-gourd vase from the JT Tai Collection which sold for a record-breaking price of $32.4 million (pre-sale estimate of $4/6 million) and a massive Imperial White Jae "Xintian Zhuren" Qing dynasty seal which shattered the record for an Imperial seal at auction, selling for $15.6 million (pre-sale estimate of $3/4 million). The number of buyers from China who have purchased objects worth $500,000 or above has increased almost 400% from 2004 to 2010.
Sotheby's London series of Contemporary and Italian Art sales, including Contemporary Arab & Iranian Art, brought $69.6 million in London, more than double last year's total of $32.8 million and at the top end of the pre-sale high estimate. The joint two top-selling lots of the week were Lucio Fontana's and his green and gold , which brought $3.7 million each. Part One of the Jerry Hall Collection realized $3.7 million and was headlined by Lucian Freud's , which sold for $1 million  more than double the pre-sale estimate.

London's sales of Islamic Works of Art were extremely successful, bringing $40.3 million, a 222% improvement over last year's total of $12.5 million and surpassing the pre-sale estimate of $25/35 million. Highlighting the sales was an exceptionally rare and important Nasrid Ear-Dagger, from 15 century Spain, which brought $5.9 million, several times the pre-sale low estimate.
th
Property from Chatsworth House, England's most magnificent stately home and the home of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, doubled the pre-sale estimate when it was sold on site last month for $10.3 million. Fierce bidding took place over the three day sale for the over 1,400 lots on offer in the largest country house sale staged in England since 1977. Included in the sale were items from the great houses of Chatsworth, Chiswick House, Bolton Abbey, Compton Place, Devonshire House, Hardwick Hall, Holker Hall and Lismore Castle and
4
proceeds are earmarked for projects to improve Chatsworth and the Duke of Devonshire's other Estates.
On October 29, Sotheby's Hong Kong sold over 2,000 bottles of Chteau Lafite dating from 1869 to 2008 which had never previously left the Chteau. It is virtually unprecedented for Lafite to release library vintages from their private cellar and collectors responded to this historic sale with extraordinary enthusiasm. The sale totaled $8.4 million, over three times the high estimate and was 100% sold, becoming Sotheby's tenth consecutive 100% sold wine auction held in Hong Kong in the last 18 months. The highlight of the sale was three single bottle lots of Chteau Lafite  Rothschild 1869 which each sold for $232,692 (pre-sale estimate of $5,000/8,000) to set a new world record for a single bottle of wine at auction.
th
Upcoming Sales
Next week in New York, Sotheby's Contemporary Art sales (combined pre-sale estimate of $194/273 million) are highlighted by a major 1955 painting by Mark Rothko which has been off the market for over forty years (pre-sale estimate of $20/30 million) and Andy Warhol's iconic the last of four paintings of individual Coca-Cola bottles executed by Warhol in 1961 and 1962s (pre-sale estimate of $20/25 million). Other works in the sales are by Francis Bacon, Gerhard Richter, Roy Lichtenstein, and Robert Rauschenberg among others.

In Geneva on November 16, the Magnificent Jewels sale includes one of the rarest and most beautiful gemstones ever offered at auction  a 24.78 carat Fancy Intense Pink Diamond, last seen on the market some 60 years ago (pre-sale estimate of $27/38 million). The sale also offers a rich selection of some 500 lots, including an impressive array of white diamonds and exceptional colored gemstones in addition to jewels with important provenance, period gems and creations signed by the world's greatest jewelers. The total sale has a pre-sale estimate of $67/97 million.
th
Later in the month, on November 30, twenty pieces from the legendary auction of the "Jewels of the Duchess of Windsor", held at Sotheby's in 1987, will be offered. Sold in London, the jewelry includes exquisite examples of the genius of Cartier in collaboration with

the Windsors as well as pieces whose inscriptions tell the story of one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century (combined pre-sale estimate of $4.5/6.7 million). 
Also in London, on December 7, Sotheby's will hold a sale of Magnificent Books, Manuscripts and Drawings from the Collection of Frederick, 2nd Lord Hesketh. The most expensive book in the world, Audubon's ($6/10 million) and the most important book in all of English Literature, Shakespeare's ($1.6/2.4 million) are two highlights of the 91 lot sale (total combined pre-sale estimate of $13/16 million).

On the same day, Sotheby's New York will hold a sale of Antiquities from the Collection of the Late Clarence Day.

Highlighting the sale is a Marble Portrait Bust of the Deified Antinous, Roman Imperial, Reign of Hadrian, Circa AD 130-138 ($2/3 million) who was the favorite of the Emperor. The sale has a total pre-sale estimate of $5/8 million.
A number of important works of historical significance come on the market on December 10 in New York. Among them is from The Battle of The Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876, also known as Custer's Last Stand which is one of the few physical artifacts that exists of the battle. This cavalry guidon, or swallow-tail flag, has a pre-sale estimate of $2/5 million. "First draft of Basket Ball rules", a two-page typed document comprising a set of 13 rules written by James Naismith in 1891 and which gave birth to the game of basketball is estimated to bring in excess of $2 million. Robert F. Kennedy's Emancipation Proclamation, signed by Abraham Lincoln and hanging in Kennedy's family home, Hickory Hill, for over four decades, is one of only nineteen copies known to survive (pre-sale estimate of $1/1.5 million).

EXHIBIT 99.1
Press Release New York
November 22, 2010, New York  Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced the commencement of a modified "Dutch auction" tender offer (the "Tender Offer") for a portion of its outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Notes") in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase for Cash, dated November 22, 2010, and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal (together, the "Offer Documents"). A summary of the Tender Offer is outlined below.
Sotheby's is offering to purchase for cash, up to $50,000,000 (the "Tender Cap") aggregate principal amount of the Notes, in accordance with the modified "Dutch auction" procedures described below. As of November 18, 2010, $128,250,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes was outstanding.
The Tender Offer commenced today and will expire at 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on December 20, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated (such date and time, as the same may be extended or earlier terminated, the "Expiration Date"). Holders of Notes that validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Notes on or before 5:00 P.M., New York time, on December 6, 2010, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the "Early Tender Date"), will be eligible to receive the Total Consideration for their Notes.
The "Total Consideration" for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Tender Offer at or prior to the Early Tender Date and which are accepted for purchase by Sotheby's pursuant to the Tender Offer will be equal to the Clearing Price (as defined below). The Total Consideration includes an amount (the "Early Tender Payment") equal to $30 for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase. The "Tender Offer Consideration" for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer (and not validly withdrawn) after the Early Tender Date and at or prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase by Sotheby's will consist of the Total Consideration less the Early Tender Payment. Notes tendered may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on December 6, 2010, unless extended by Sotheby's (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the "Withdrawal Date"), but not thereafter, except in the limited circumstances discussed in the Offer Documents.
The Tender Offer is being conducted as a modified "Dutch auction." This means that holders who elect to participate must specify the price they would be willing to receive in exchange for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes they choose to tender in the Tender Offer. The price that holders specify for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes must be expressed in increments of $2.50, and may not be less than $1,050 (the "Minimum Bid Price") nor more than $1,100 (the "Maximum Bid Price") per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Holders who do not specify a price will be deemed to have specified a price equal to the Minimum Bid Price in respect to Notes tendered and to accept the Clearing Price determined by Sotheby's in accordance with the terms of the Offer to Purchase. Tenders of Notes for which a price is specified below the Minimum Bid Price or in excess of the Maximum Bid Price will not be accepted for purchase and will not be used for the purpose of determining the Clearing Price. Tenders of Notes not submitted in whole increments of $2.50 will be rounded down to the nearest $2.50 increment.
Sotheby's, if it accepts Notes for purchase in the Tender Offer, will accept Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the order of the lowest to the highest bid prices specified by tendering holders (in increments of $2.50), and will select the single lowest price (the "Clearing Price") for all tenders of Notes such that, for all tenders of Notes whose bid price is equal to or less than such Clearing Price, Sotheby's will be able to purchase the principal amount of Notes equal to the Tender Cap (or, if Notes in a principal amount less than the Tender Cap are validly tendered, all Notes so tendered, in which case, the Clearing Price will be the highest bid price). The price at which Notes are validly tendered (before the subtraction of the Early Tender Payment with respect to Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date) will be used for the purpose of determining the Clearing Price and proration as described below. Sotheby's will pay the same price (subject to adjustment, as described below) for all Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or below the Clearing Price and accepted for purchase by Sotheby's in the Tender Offer, except the price paid for Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date will be reduced by the Early Tender Payment set out above.
If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes validly tendered at or below the Clearing Price (and not validly withdrawn) exceeds the Tender Cap, then, subject to the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, Sotheby's, if it accepts Notes in the Tender Offer, will accept for purchase, first, Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at prices below the Clearing Price and, thereafter, Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at the Clearing Price on a prorated basis according to the principal amount of such Notes. All Notes not accepted as a result of proration and all Notes tendered at prices in excess of the Clearing Price will be rejected from the Tender Offer and will be returned to tendering Holders at our expense promptly following the earlier of the Expiration Date or the date on which the Tender Offer is terminated. We will make appropriate adjustments downward to the nearest $1,000 principal amount to avoid purchases of Notes in principal amounts other than integral multiples of $1,000. We will also make adjustments so that the principal amount of a Note remaining outstanding shall not be less than $2,000.
Holders whose Notes are accepted by Sotheby's for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will also be eligible to receive accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes accepted for purchase, up to, but excluding, the date of payment of the applicable consideration (the "Settlement Date"). The Settlement Date for the Offer will occur promptly following the Expiration Date.

Global Bondholder Services Corporation is serving as Depositary and Information Agent in connection with the Tender Offer.

The "Total Consideration" for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Tender Offer at or prior to the Early Tender Date and which are accepted for purchase by Sotheby's pursuant to the Tender Offer will be equal to the Clearing Price (as defined below). The Total Consideration includes an amount (the "Early Tender Payment") equal to $30 for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase. The "Tender Offer Consideration" for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer (and not validly withdrawn) after the Early Tender Date and at or prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase by Sotheby's will consist of the Total Consideration less the Early Tender Payment. Notes tendered may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on December 6, 2010, unless extended by Sotheby's (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the "Withdrawal Date"), but not thereafter, except in the limited circumstances discussed in the Offer Documents.
The Tender Offer is being conducted as a modified "Dutch auction." This means that holders who elect to participate must specify the price they would be willing to receive in exchange for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes they choose to tender in the Tender Offer. The price that holders specify for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes must be expressed in increments of $2.50, and may not be less than $1,050 (the "Minimum Bid Price") nor more than $1,100 (the "Maximum Bid Price") per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Holders who do not specify a price will be deemed to have specified a price equal to the Minimum Bid Price in respect to Notes tendered and to accept the Clearing Price determined by Sotheby's in accordance with the terms of the Offer to Purchase. Tenders of Notes for which a price is specified below the Minimum Bid Price or in excess of the Maximum Bid Price will not be accepted for purchase and will not be used for the purpose of determining the Clearing Price. Tenders of Notes not submitted in whole increments of $2.50 will be rounded down to the nearest $2.50 increment.
Sotheby's, if it accepts Notes for purchase in the Tender Offer, will accept Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the order of the lowest to the highest bid prices specified by tendering holders (in increments of $2.50), and will select the single lowest price (the "Clearing Price") for all tenders of Notes such that, for all tenders of Notes whose bid price is equal to or less than such Clearing Price, Sotheby's will be able to purchase the principal amount of Notes equal to the Tender Cap (or, if Notes in a principal amount less than the Tender Cap are validly tendered, all Notes so tendered, in which case, the Clearing Price will be the highest bid price). The price at which Notes are validly tendered (before the subtraction of the Early Tender Payment with respect to Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date) will be used for the purpose of determining the Clearing Price and proration as described below. Sotheby's will pay the same price (subject to adjustment, as described below) for all Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or below the Clearing Price and accepted for purchase by Sotheby's in the Tender Offer, except the price paid for Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date will be reduced by the Early Tender Payment set out above.
If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes validly tendered at or below the Clearing Price (and not validly withdrawn) exceeds the Tender Cap, then, subject to the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, Sotheby's, if it accepts Notes in the Tender Offer, will accept for purchase, first, Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at prices below the Clearing Price and, thereafter, Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at the Clearing Price on a prorated basis according to the principal amount of such Notes. All Notes not accepted as a result of proration and all Notes tendered at prices in excess of the Clearing Price will be rejected from the Tender Offer and will be returned to tendering Holders at our expense promptly following the earlier of the Expiration Date or the date on which the Tender Offer is terminated. We will make appropriate adjustments downward to the nearest $1,000 principal amount to avoid purchases of Notes in principal amounts other than integral multiples of $1,000. We will also make adjustments so that the principal amount of a Note remaining outstanding shall not be less than $2,000.
Holders whose Notes are accepted by Sotheby's for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will also be eligible to receive accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes accepted for purchase, up to, but excluding, the date of payment of the applicable consideration (the "Settlement Date"). The Settlement Date for the Offer will occur promptly following the Expiration Date.

           On August 31, 2009, Sotheby's and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Borrowers" or "Sotheby's") entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with an international syndicate of lenders led by General Electric Capital Corporation ("GE Capital"). The Credit Agreement, among other things, provides for a $200 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), subject to a borrowing base, as defined in the Credit Agreement.
          On November 23, 2010, Sotheby's entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Amendment") with GE Capital, as Agent, and the lenders named therein (collectively, the "Lenders"). The Amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility, reduced borrowing costs and fees and provided additional flexibility to Sotheby's.

          The Amendment made the following changes, among other things, to the Credit Agreement:
          Sotheby's incurred approximately $1.5 million in fees related to the Amendment, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the extended term of the Credit Agreement.

                    (b)          To induce Lenders to provide the LIBOR Loan option on the terms provided herein, if (i) any LIBOR Loans are repaid in whole or in part prior to the last day of any applicable LIBOR Period (whether that repayment is made pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or occurs as a result of acceleration, by operation of law or otherwise); (ii) any Borrower shall default in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Loan; (iii) any Borrower shall refuse to accept any borrowing of, or shall request a termination of, any borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of, LIBOR Loans after Borrower Representative has given notice requesting the same in accordance herewith; (iv) any Borrower shall fail to make any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan after Borrower Representative has given a notice thereof in accordance herewith; or (v) any assignment shall occur pursuant to , then Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Lender from and against all losses, costs and expenses resulting from or arising from any of the foregoing. Such indemnification shall include any loss (excluding loss of margin) or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate deposits from which such funds were obtained. For the purpose of calculating amounts payable to a Lender under this subsection, each Lender shall be deemed to have actually funded its portion of the relevant LIBOR Loan (or its participation interest in such LIBOR Loan) through the purchase of a deposit bearing interest at the Dollar LIBOR Rate or the Sterling LIBOR Rate, as applicable, in an amount equal to the amount of such portion of such LIBOR Loan (or such participation, as applicable) and having a maturity comparable to the relevant LIBOR Period; , that each Lender may fund each of its interests in LIBOR Loans (or its participations in LIBOR Loans) in any manner it sees fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this subsection. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder. As promptly as practicable under the circumstances, each Lender shall provide Borrower Representative with its written calculation of all amounts payable pursuant to this , and such calculation shall be binding on the parties hereto unless Borrower Representative shall object in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt thereof, specifying the basis for such objection in detail.

Furthermore, so long as any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Credit Party shall provide Agent and each Lender with access to their suppliers and customers to the extent such access is within the rights and powers of such Credit Party. Each Credit Party shall make available to Agent and its counsel reasonably promptly originals or copies of all books and records that Agent may reasonably request. Each Credit Party shall deliver any document or instrument necessary for Agent, as it may from time to time reasonably request, to obtain records from any service bureau or other Person that maintains records for such Credit Party, and shall maintain duplicate records or supporting documentation on media, including computer tapes and discs owned by such Credit Party.

The Borrower Representative (on behalf of the U.K. Credit Parties) shall, thereafter, be responsible for dealing with such authority in relation to the processing of such application (and the Treaty Lender shall provide such cooperation as is reasonably necessary to complete any further procedural formalities required to obtain authorization).

by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to Agent), pay to Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to Borrower Representative and to Agent by such Lender, shall be presumptive evidence of the matters set forth therein. Each Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after it becomes aware of any circumstances referred to above which would result in any such increased cost, the affected Lender shall, to the extent not inconsistent with such Lender's internal policies of general application, use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize costs and expenses incurred by it and payable to it by Borrowers pursuant to this .

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower Representative may revoke any Notice of Revolving Credit Advance or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it.

75
Amount, Agent shall be entitled to hold such funds as cash collateral in a non-interest bearing account up to an amount equal to such Non-Funding Lender's unfunded Commitment and to use such amount to pay such Non-Funding Lender's funding obligations hereunder until the Obligations are paid in full in cash, all Letter of Credit Obligations have been discharged or cash collateralized and all Commitments have been terminated. Upon any such unfunded obligations owing by a Non-Funding Lender becoming due and payable, Agent shall be authorized to use such cash collateral to make such payment on behalf of such Non-Funding Lender. With respect to such Non-Funding Lender's failure to fund Revolving Credit Advances, purchase participations in Letters of Credit or Letter of Credit Obligations or fund participations pursuant to Section 9.9(e)(i), any amounts applied by Agent to satisfy such funding shortfalls shall be deemed to constitute a Revolving Credit Advance or amount of the participation required to be funded and, if necessary to effectuate the foregoing, the other Lenders shall be deemed to have sold, and such Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, Revolving Credit Advances or participation interests from the other Lenders until such time as the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Advances, participations in Letters of Credit and Letter of Credit Obligations and participations under Section 9.9(e)(i) are held by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders. Any amounts owing by a Non-Funding Lender to Agent which are not paid when due shall accrue interest at the interest rate applicable during such period to Index Rate Loans. In the event that Agent is holding cash collateral of a Non-Funding Lender that cures pursuant to clause (v) below or ceases to be a Non-Funding Lender pursuant to the definition of Non-Funding Lender, Agent shall return the unused portion of such cash collateral to such Lender. The "Aggregate Excess Funding Amount" of a Non-Funding Lender shall be the aggregate amount of (A) all unpaid obligations owing by such Lender to Agent, L/C Issuers, Swing Line Lender, Fronting Lender and other Lenders under the Loan Documents, including such Lender's pro rata share of all Revolving Loans, Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Line Loans and such Lender's participations pursuant to Section 9.9(e)(i), plus, without duplication, (B) all amounts of such Non-Funding Lender's Commitment reallocated to other Lenders pursuant to Section 9.9(d)(ii).

If all or any part of the assets of any Obligor, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of such Obligor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction or any other action or proceeding, or if the business of any such Obligor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets of any such Obligor are sold, then, and in any such event (such events being herein referred to as an ""), any payment or distribution of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which shall be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to any indebtedness of any Obligor to any U.K. Borrower ("") shall be paid or delivered directly to Agent for application to the Secured Obligations in accordance with the Loan Documents.

If, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Agent or any Lender shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any applicable laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or the like, each Borrower hereby consents to such action by Agent or such Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by Agent or such Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of subrogation that each Borrower might otherwise have had but for such action by Agent or such Lender. Any election of remedies that results in the denial or impairment of the right of Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower's obligation to pay the full amount of the Secured Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Borrower. In the event Agent or any Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale permitted by law or the Loan Documents, Agent or such Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Secured Obligations and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Agent or such Lender but shall be credited against the Secured Obligations. The amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether Agent, Lender or any other party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Secured Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Secured Obligations guaranteed by the applicable Borrowers under this , notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
          On February 28, 2011, the Company issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
February 28, 2011, New York - -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2010.
2010 brought the best financial results for Sotheby's in its 267-year history, apart from 2007. Consolidated Sales* were $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.8 billion in the year, an increase of 57% and 74%, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010, total revenues were $318.0 million and $774.3 million, respectively, an increase of 46% and 60%, when compared to the same periods in the prior year. This is almost entirely due to an increase in auction commission revenues stemming from strong sales around the world during the periods. In 2010, there was a 105% increase in the number of works sold over $1 million, the point at which the buyer's premium rate decreases from 20% to 12%. As a result, offsetting the increase in auction commission revenues is a decline in auction commission margin from 20.4% to 18.0% in the fourth quarter and from 20.7% to 18.3% in the full year, largely attributable to this change in sales mix towards higher valued items in both periods.
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $155.5 million, a $56.6 million, or 57%, growth from the prior period. For the full year, operating income was $274.0 million, a $220.9 million, or 416% increase from the prior year. These increases are largely due to the aforementioned growth in revenues and are offset by higher incentive compensation costs stemming from the strong results of the periods as well as an increase in direct costs of services that is consistent with the level and composition of our auction offerings during these periods.
Net income for the fourth quarter was up 31% on prior year to $96.2 million, or $1.38 per diluted share and $161.0 million, or $2.34 per diluted share for the full year (compared to net income of $73.6 million, or $1.09 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a net loss of ($6.5) million, or ($0.10) per share for the full year of 2009).
"The net income of $161.0 million that we have been able to deliver in 2010 is our best yearly result ever, apart from 2007. It is a remarkable accomplishment," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "The recovery of the global art market which was aided in part by the increased buying activity of clients from new markets certainly contributed to these results, as did the difficult decisions we had to make beginning in the autumn of 2008  the headcount reduction, tightening of our cost structure and steadfast focus on auction commission margins  which have paid off considerably and translated to an EBITDA margin** of 37.2% which is 200 basis points higher than in 2007. The leverage in our business model is clear and consistent, and reflects our focused approach to cost discipline and margin management in 2010.
"Our success was achieved with a much lower risk profile than in the previous peak years of 2006 and 2007, as we have been highly selective in our use of auction guarantees and only issued such guarantees in tandem with risk sharing arrangements that very significantly reduced our financial exposure," continued Mr. Ruprecht.
A solid balance sheet showed cash at the end of 2010 of $483.7 million. Thanks to recent excellent results and liquidity, the Company was able to buy back $48.3 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter and further de-leverage our balance sheet. This debt extinguishment incurred a charge of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter but will, however, reduce future annual interest expense by approximately $3.7 million in each of the next three years, 2011 through 2014, and by approximately $1.8 million in 2015. In addition, Sotheby's was upgraded by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's during the year; and was able to extend out the maturity of its bank revolving credit facility by two years to September 2014. As 2011 begins, liquidity is strong.

"The positive momentum continues in 2011," added Mr. Ruprecht. "Our recently concluded London sales of Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art, including the exceptional single owner sale, brought an outstanding combined total of $390.8 million. This total even exceeds the prior year total of $366.7 million which had included the sale of the then-record breaking Giacometti sculpture which sold for $104.3 million. And we have just announced the sale of a selection of magnificent Imperial Porcelain from the Meiyintang Collection, one of the greatest private collections of Imperial Chinese Porcelain in the world. Estimated at between $91-137 million, the sale in Hong Kong on April 7 is likely to be of historic importance and brings the estimate for the total April Hong Kong series to in excess of $300 million.

th
"Overall, aggregate auction sales through the first two months of 2011 solidly improved from the first two months of 2010. We hope that 2011 will be another strong year for Sotheby's and for the art market," concluded Mr. Ruprecht.
In January in New York, Sotheby's Old Master Paintings sale led the market and brought $90.6 million, near the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $65/92 million. Sixteen artists records were broken, including the record for Titian, whose rare brought $16.9 million.
Year to Date 2011 Sales
The Madonna and Child with Saints Luke and Catherine of Alexandria
Our Impressionist and Modern Art sales in London earlier this month led the market and also sold the two top works of the week. Picasso's iconic 1932 painting of Marie-Therese Walter, , sold for $40.7 million, more than double the pre-sale low estimate. Dali's masterpiece, was pursued by no fewer than nine prospective buyers and soared above the pre-sale estimate to sell for $21.7 million. It tripled the record established for Dali set earlier in the week and also became a new record price for any Surrealist work of art sold at auction. Totals for Impressionist and Modern Art sold at Sotheby's, including works from the single owner sale , brought $225.2 million, surpassing the pre-sale high estimate for the series.

Our Contemporary Art Auction series in London also led the market and brought an excellent $161.3 million, well exceeding the pre-sale high estimate for the series of $122 million and representing the second highest total for a London February Contemporary Art Sales series. The top lot of the evening sale was Richter's , which sold for $11.5 million, beyond the pre-sale high estimate.

Expectations were high heading into the single owner auction of , and these expectations were more than justified. The Collection entered the rarified group of white glove' sales when it was 100% sold, totaling $150.5 million and more than doubling the pre-sale low estimate. In addition to the aforementioned Dali record, the Collection included Francis Bacon's triptych of Lucian Freud, which sold for $37.0 million.

On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin rocketed out of the Earth's atmosphere aboard the small, spherical Vostok 3KA-3 Space Capsule, becoming the first man to travel into outer space. Almost three weeks beforehand, the Soviet space program launched the final test flight of the Vostok spacecraft in preparation for this momentous event. The Vostok 3KA-2 carried a life-size cosmonaut mannequin, Ivan Ivanovich, and a dog, Zvezdochka, into low Earth orbit, and reentered on its first pass over Russia 115 minutes later. Sotheby's will offer the Vostok 3KA-2 Space Capsule, which paved the way for Gagarin's historic mission, in a dedicated auction in New York on April 12, 2011, the 50 anniversary of man's first flight into outer space (pre-sale estimate of $2/10 million).

APPENDIX B
GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In this release, financial measures are presented in accordance with GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis. All references in this release denoted by ** are to "adjusted" non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin are supplemental measures of Sotheby's performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of Sotheby's liquidity. Management cautions users of Sotheby's financial statements that amounts presented in accordance with its definitions of EBITDA and EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies and analysts calculate such measures in the same manner. Management believes that EBITDA and EBITDA Margin provide important supplemental measures of Sotheby's performance and that these measures may be used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the valuation of Sotheby's. Management also utilizes EBITDA in analyzing Sotheby's performance and in the determination of annual incentive compensation. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the comparable GAAP amounts is included below (in thousands of dollars).

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
          On May 9, 2011, the Company issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
May 9, 2011, New York  Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
The first quarter has traditionally been a loss period for the Company because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market. However, for the first quarter of 2011, the Company is reporting net income of $2.4 million, or $0.03 per share, as compared to a net loss of ($2.2) million or ($0.03) per share in the prior year. This improvement is principally due to higher auction commission revenues resulting from a 23% increase in net auction sales, partially offset by a decline in auction commission margin from 17.2% to 16.4%, which is attributable to sales mix. In the first quarter, there was an increase in works of art sold in the upper price bands, including a 63% increase in the number of works sold over $1 million (from 62 to 101 lots). Competitive pressures to win these high value consignments resulted in lower commission margins as Sotheby's sales approached the peak levels of 2006 - 2008.
The improvement vs. 2010 is partially offset by a $14.7 million, or 16%, increase in operating expenses. A portion of this increase ($4.2 million) is attributable to higher dealer cost of sales principally due to $2.6 million in inventory writedowns and increased dealer sales revenues. Total operating expenses, excluding dealer cost of sales, increased $10.5 million, or 11%*, from the prior period. First quarter results also benefited from a recovery of $3.0 million as a result of the resolution of a litigation matter. This recovery relates to interest earned on the overdue balance ($2.2 million), compensation for lost auction commissions ($0.4 million) and the partial reimbursement of legal fees ($0.4 million).
"This is one of our best first quarters on record," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's. "It is all the more impressive given the outstanding first quarter of 2010, which included one work by Giacometti which sold for an unprecedented $104.3 million.
"Sales are up year to date by 31%, continuing the positive momentum into the second quarter of 2011," continued Mr. Ruprecht. "Our Hong Kong sales have been a major contributor, bringing a record total of $447 million, near the high end of the pre-sale estimate and showing the depth and breadth of wealth in that region. And our Impressionist and Modern Art sales last week brought a solid $209.5 million with works that were fairly and conservatively estimated bringing particularly strong prices.
"Going forward, we are very pleased with the quality of the works we are able to offer at Sotheby's around the world, concluded Mr. Ruprecht. "We have a number of outstanding works on offer in our New York Contemporary Art sales which begin this evening and will continue into a second evening sale tomorrow. An important collection of Chinese Paintings will take place in Hong Kong at the end of May and we have excellent sales in London later this spring, which include major paintings by Schiele and Guardi as well as the Duerckheim Collection, a significant collection of German Art."
Second Quarter Sales
Our Impressionist and Modern Art sales brought $209.5 million, above the pre-sale low estimate of $194 million. Works by Pablo Picasso highlighted the top lots from the evening sale, with eight of his works selling that night. The star was , a portrait of Picasso's mistress from the 1930s, Marie-Thrse Walter, which brought $21.4 million. Other standouts were Alexej von Jawlensky's and Paul Gauguin's sculpture, which brought $11.3 million each. Gauguin's sculpture broke the record for the artist at auction for sculpture and brought more than seven times the previous record.

Our April sales in Hong Kong brought a total of $447 million, a 75% increase from last year's total of $256 million and the highest total ever for a sales series in Hong Kong. Virtually every day saw records broken, including a record for any work of Contemporary Chinese Art, as well

as the highest totals at Sotheby's Hong Kong for the sale categories of Fine Chinese Paintings, 20th Century Chinese Art, Modern and Contemporary Southeast Asian Paintings, Watches and Wine.
Arts of the Islamic World sales were held last month in London with tremendous results. Beginning with part one of the Cary Welch Collection of Islamic and Indian Art, the star lot of that sale was one of the most famous illustrated Persian manuscripts ever produced, the of Shah Tahmasp. The work sold for $12.2 million, more than double the pre-sale estimate and the sale brought a total of $34.2 million, almost four times the pre-sale estimate. The various owner Arts of the Islamic World sale brought a remarkable $26.4 million, bringing the series total to an outstanding $60.6 million, more than double last year's total.
Shahnameh
Our Magnificent Jewels sale in New York last month brought an exceptional $39.4 million, above the pre-sale high estimate of $35.6 million and the highest total ever for a spring jewelry auction at Sotheby's New York. Highlighting the sale were wonderful pieces from a private collection that featured romantic diamonds and fabulous Cartier designs from the firm's creative peak that brought $7.9 million, more than double the pre-sale high estimate.
We begin our New York Contemporary Art series tonight with the single owner sale of the Allan Stone Collection which includes works by Wayne Thiebaud, Willem de Kooning, John Chamberlain, Franz Kline, Joseph Cornell and others, and is estimated to bring a total of $34/48 million. Our various owner sale of Contemporary Art tomorrow evening is highlighted by Jeff Koons' Pink Panther and Andy Warhols' Sixteen Jackies, each of which has a pre-sale estimate of $20/30 million. The entire sales series, including the Stone Collection, has a total pre-sale estimate of $207/293 million.
Upcoming Sales
On May 31 in Hong Kong, we are excited to offer The Mei Yun Tang Collection of Paintings by Zhang Daqian, assembled by the late Mr. Kao Ling-mei and his wife Jan Yun-bor.

st

1940s. This sale will mark the first time ever these works have been offered for sale and the paintings have a combined pre-sale estimate in excess of $16 million.

The collection has a pre-sale estimate in excess of $53 million and will be included in the Contemporary Art series.
On July 6, in our London Old Master Paintings sale, we are excited to be able to offer one of the most exceptional Venetian View Paintings ever executed  Francesco Guardi's . Monumental in scale at 45 by 78 inches, it is one of four works that Guardi painted on this grand scale, all executed at around the same time in the late 1760s. Together, these works constitute the pinnacle of Guardi's output as a painter of and they are generally considered to be Guardi's greatest works  the first and fullest expression of the artist's mature style. This painting has a pre-sale estimate of $30 million.

Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
Item 2.05
On June 27, 2011, the Executive Committee of Sotheby's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "Restructuring Plan") impacting Sotheby's operations in Italy and the Netherlands. The Restructuring Plan will streamline Sotheby's European selling operations, with a renewed emphasis on relationships with key clients and the sourcing of important collections. It will also allow Sotheby's global management to focus resources on strategic growth markets, especially China and other strategic priorities. In the Netherlands, the Restructuring Plan will result in the cessation of all local auction sales. In Italy, Sotheby's will significantly reduce its auction sales calendar, but plans to continue to conduct auctions of Contemporary and Modern art. These streamlined operations will continue to source property to Sotheby's other selling locations throughout the world and pursue private sale opportunities.
The Restructuring Plan will reduce staffing levels by 23 (approximately 45% of headcount in Italy and the Netherlands and 2% of global headcount), and allow Sotheby's to completely exit its leased Amsterdam salesroom facility, and replace it with a smaller local office, and to reduce its leased premises in Milan. These actions are expected to result in total restructuring charges of approximately $4.3 million in 2011, consisting of employee termination benefits of approximately $1.6 million, to be recognized in the second quarter of 2011, and lease exit costs of approximately $2.7 million, that will be recognized principally in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Following full implementation, beginning in 2012, the Restructuring Plan is expected to result in reductions to Net Auction Sales, Revenues and Expenses of approximately $50 million, $10 million and $7 million, respectively, when compared to 2010. Accordingly, the Restructuring Plan is not expected to result in incremental profitability in 2012 as compared to 2010 and in fact, these actions would have had a dilutive impact of approximately $3 million to 2010 pre-tax earnings. However, 2010 results for the Netherlands included Net Auction Sales and Revenues of $19 million and $3 million, respectively, related to unique sales of single-owner collections that are not likely to be repeated in the near term. Accordingly, excluding restructuring charges, these actions are not expected to have a dilutive impact on future results.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On August 3, 2011, the Company issued a press release discussing its results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release New York
 
August 3, 2011, New York  Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the second quarter and first half ended June 30, 2011.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, Sotheby's net income increased by 48% and 54% to $127.2 million and $129.7 million, respectively, when compared to the prior year. This improvement is principally due to significantly higher auction and private sale commission revenues, partially offset by a decline in auction commission margin
2
to 16.4% in both periods, from 18.7% in the second quarter of 2010 and 18.3% in the first half of 2010. Competitive pressures to win high value consignments resulted in lower commission margins, as Sotheby's consolidated sales reached a record $3.4 billion in the first half of 2011.
The net income improvement versus 2010 is also partially offset by a $39.4 million, or 28%, increase in operating expenses in the second quarter and a $54.1 million, or 23%, increase in the first half. This is largely due to higher salaries and related costs  a $22.2 million, or 30%, increase in the second quarter and a $27.5 million, or 23%, increase in the first half  primarily stemming from higher incentive compensation costs, attributable to the improvement in Sotheby's financial performance, and to higher full-time salaries, due to strategic headcount and salary increases. Also, general and administrative expenses increased $7.9 million, or 24%, in the second quarter and $9.8 million, or 15%, in the first half, largely due to increased consulting fees to develop Sotheby's strategic initiatives and unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
"This is the best quarter in Sotheby's history," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Great works of art are enormously desirable to collectors from every corner of the world right now. Our operating metrics, in terms of earnings and EBITDA margins
3
, are at historic levels, and we continue to enjoy great opportunity in both traditional as well as newer market environments.
Mr. Ruprecht continued: "Record first half consolidated sales (up by 44%) reflected the surge of activity from buyers and sellers across China as well as significant increases in auction sales in each of our four principal selling centers. Private sales, up 114% in the half, were another important contributor to these outstanding results. As I look back on these extraordinary six months for our business, the global appeal of art was one of the few constants in a period of continued economic uncertainty.
"An exciting fall season is already taking shape and our clients around the world can expect a number of wonderful sales and objects at Sotheby's this autumn," concluded Mr. Ruprecht.
Second and Third Quarter Sales
Sotheby's London sales included some tremendous successes. Exceptional sales of Contemporary Art surpassed the high estimate and brought $174 million and $206 million for the evening and series, respectively, with the superb Duerckheim Collection contributing almost $100 million to that result. The Impressionist and Modern Art sales series achieved a combined $181 million, comfortably within the presale estimate and included the highest price of the London Impressionist week when Egon Schiele's 1914 sold for $40 million, almost double the previous record for the artist at auction.
Cityscape Hauser mit bunter Waesche (Vorstadt II)/ Houses with Laundry (Suburb II)
Our Old Master and British Paintings Evening Sale in July achieved $76.5 million and included the second highest price for any work of art sold at auction thus far this year. Achieving that distinction was Guardi's , which sold for $42.9 million, becoming the second highest price ever achieved for an Old Master Painting at auction.

Also in London, the Evill/Frost sale, which brought $69.4 million and was a record for a sale of 20th Century British Art, and the Hascoe sale, which set a record for Czech Modern Art when it brought $18 million, were among the wonderful accomplishments in our London season.

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release New York
 
 
November 7, 2011, New York  Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced results for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2011.
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, Sotheby's auction and related revenues totaled $52.9 million, which is $2.2 million, or 4%, lower than the prior period. This is largely due to an $8.1 million, or 4%, decline in net auction sales over the period resulting from a $13.8 million decrease in single-owner sales during the quarter. Net loss for the third quarter is $29.7 million as compared to a net loss of $19.4 million in the prior period. The increased loss is partially attributable to higher general and administrative expenses and lower auction commission revenues. Current quarter results are also unfavorably impacted by $5.7 million of Dealer segment inventory writedowns related to Noortman Master Paintings, restructuring charges of $2.2 million related to the streamlining of Sotheby's European selling operations and a $1.5 million charge related to the redemption of $18.1 million of Sotheby's Convertible Notes. Third quarter 2011 net loss is reduced by an $11.6 million tax benefit recognized due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, Auction Sales in the third quarter have historically represented only approximately 7%-10% of annual Auction Sales, and the third quarter has historically been a loss period for the Company. As a result, third quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should
focus on results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, Sotheby's net income is $99.9 million, a $35.2 million, or 55%, increase when compared to the same period in the prior year. This improvement is principally due to higher auction and private sale commission revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that is due, in part, to higher incentive compensation costs, a higher level of direct costs consistent with the volume and composition of auction sales, and the cost of investments in strategic initiatives. Year-to-date results are also unfavorably impacted by $8.3 million of Dealer segment inventory writedowns related to Noortman Master Paintings as well as year-to-date restructuring charges of $4.5 million. September year-to-date results also reflect the impact of the reversal of the aforementioned valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
"Sotheby's continues to enjoy fierce bidding for great works of art," said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Consolidated sales
1
for the first nine months are up 36% to $3.8 billion and against a backdrop of global economic volatility, our Impressionist sales last week brought $229.7 million. There is vibrant demand for works of art which are fresh to the marketplace and appropriately priced."
Fourth Quarter Sales
Last week in New York, our Impressionist and Modern Art sales brought a strong $229.7 million, well within the pre-sale estimate of $202/289 million and with exceptional prices for many works. The highlight of the evening sale was Gustav Klimt's which brought spirited competition in the sales room and sold for $40.4 million, much above the pre-sale estimate of $25 million. Other highlights included Pablo Picasso's which sold for $23.0 million, setting the record at auction for a late work by the artist and Gustave Caillebotte's which sold for $18.0 million, well in excess of the pre-sale high estimate of $12 million and a new record for the artist at auction.

Last month in Hong Kong, Sotheby's series of sales brought $410.8 million, the second highest total ever for a week-long series of sales at Sotheby's Hong Kong and well within the pre-sale
 
estimate of $353/485 million. Record various-owner sales totals were achieved for Contemporary Asian Art, 20

Sotheby's to Offer One of the World's Most Famous Masterpieces -- Edvard Munch's
The Scream
-- on May 2nd in New York
February 29, 2012, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011.
 
In 2011, Sotheby's generated the best financial results in its 268-year history, apart from its record year in 2007. Sotheby's strong financial performance was driven by a $57.5 million, or 7%, increase in revenues attributable to growth in both auction and private sale commission revenues. Offsetting the growth in revenues was a higher level of operating expenses due in part to increased staff levels and their associated compensation costs, a higher level of direct costs of services consistent with the volume and composition of auction sales and the cost of investments in Sotheby's strategic initiatives, principally related to the growth of its business in China and enhancing its information technology and online offerings.
Full year results were favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $13.6 million, or $0.20 per share, recognized in 2011 associated with the reversal of a valuation allowance against certain of Sotheby's deferred tax assets, and a pre-tax $7.6 million decrease in net interest expense. Including these factors, net income for 2011 is $171.4 million, a $10.5 million, or 7%, increase from the prior year; diluted earnings per share is $2.46, a $0.12, or 5%, increase from 2010.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter is $71.5 million, compared to $96.2 million in the prior period. This decrease is largely attributable to a decline in auction and related revenues which totaled $274.9 million, $35.6 million, or 11%, lower than the prior period. This is primarily due to an $85.2 million, or 5%, decline in net auction sales over the period resulting from a $171.0 million, or 46%, decrease in single-owner sales during the quarter, as well as a significant decrease in auction commission margin. The decline in auction revenues is partially offset by a decrease in salaries and related costs, attributable to a lower level of incentive compensation expense in the quarter.
 
Sotheby's had great success last year, handling masterpieces, innovating in new markets and building trust based relationships with clients globally and our 2011 financial results reflected those efforts. They are near the best we have ever delivered, said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer.  
 
Mr. Ruprecht continued: Consolidated sales

in 2011 were an excellent $5.8 billion, as healthy
1
Exhibit 99.1
bidding continued around the world for great works of art. Private sales, an increasingly important part of Sotheby's business, totaled a record $814.6 million, a 65% increase. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and w
e are continuing to invest in our business, including bolstering our information technology and online offerings in order to enhance our service to clients.
We are also further expanding our high-growth business in China as well as other new markets, said Mr. Ruprecht. 
Impressively, and for the first time ever, Sotheby's consolidated sales
1
in Asia reached $1 billion in 2011. We have now reached the point where the three geographic engines driving our auction business - the Americas, Europe, and Asia - are contributing to our success in roughly equal proportions. This has allowed us to realize a more diversified revenue stream, even as we remain focused on commission margins and cost discipline across our global organization.
Year to Date 2012 Sales
In January 2012, in New York, Sotheby's Old Masters Paintings sale totaled $62.1 million, above the pre-sale low estimate of $60.7 million. Highlighting the sale were Canaletto's

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release New York
SOTHEBY'S REPORTS 2012 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
May 10, 2012, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2012.
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2012, operating revenues totaled $105.0 million, a $14.6 million, or 12%, decrease from the prior period. This decline is primarily due to a $172 million, or 29%, reduction in net auction sales. In 2011, Sotheby's had unusually strong first quarter auctions, led by
Looking Closely,
the exceptional single owner sale in London of Impressionist and Contemporary Art which alone totaled $132 million in net auction sales. Partially offsetting the decline in net auction sales is an improvement in auction commission margin, from 16.4% in the first quarter of 2011 to 18.1% in the first quarter of 2012. This margin recovery is primarily attributable to the sales mix, as there was a 23% decrease in the number of lots sold with a hammer price over $1 million, as well as an increase in the average seller's commission rate earned in the current period and a lower level of shared auction commissions. In addition, private sale commission revenues improved by $7 million, or 85%, primarily due to increased sales of high value property.
1
Exhibit 99.1
Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was ($10.7) million, or ($0.16) per diluted share, as compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in the prior period. This decrease is largely due to the aforementioned decline in net auction sales and revenues, as well as a 5% increase in operating expenses, in large measure attributable to investments in support of Sotheby's strategic initiatives, including the development of Sotheby's presence in growth markets. The comparison to the prior period is also impacted by a $3 million recovery recognized in the first quarter of 2011, resulting from the favorable resolution of a legal matter.
 
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, first and third quarter results have historically reflected a lower volume of auction activity when compared to the second and fourth quarters and, typically, a net loss due to the fixed nature of many of Sotheby's operating expenses. As a result, first quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
As the excellent results of our May auctions make abundantly clear, the first quarter results are in no way reflective of a slowdown in demand for works of art around the world, said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer. Our first quarter results are largely comparable year on year were it not for the exceptional single owner sale
Looking Closely
in the prior year.
Art continues to be viewed as an attractive asset class by collectors around the world, continued Mr. Ruprecht. Particularly encouraging, private sales showed good momentum in the first quarter, with commission revenues up by 85%. Going forward private sales will continue to be an area of strategic focus, as will the web and our presence in high growth global markets where we are already seeing meaningful results.

Exhibit 99.1
Second Quarter Sales
Last week in New York, Sotheby's held its Impressionist and Modern Art sales which brought a total of $373.3 million, a worldwide record for Sotheby's and at the high end of the pre-sale estimate of $280/391 million. The highlight of the evening sale was Edvard Munch's
The Scream
which brought $119.9 million, the highest price ever for a work of art at auction worldwide, as eight bidders competed for twelve minutes for the iconic work. Also highlighting the auction was the sale of works from the late financier Theodore J. Forstmann. The group of sixteen works sold for a combined $83.0 million with the top lot, Pablo Picasso's Dora Maar titled
Femme assise dans un fauteuil
, bringing $29.2 million.
Sotheby's New York held its evening sale of Contemporary Art last night with a total of $266.6 million, well within the pre-sale estimate of $216/$304 million. The sale set an auction record for Roy Lichtenstein ($44.9 million for
Sleeping Girl
), for a single panel by Francis Bacon ($44.9 million for
Figure Writing Reflected In Mirror
), one of the strongest prices for Andy Warhol in some time ($37.0 million for
Double Elvis
), and a record for Cy Twombly ($17.4 million for
Untitled (New York City)
). The top end of the market performed superbly last night due to a global demand for masterpieces that is almost unparalleled, and the sale experienced a remarkable depth of bidding between $30-40 million.
Last month, an excellent week of sales in Hong Kong brought a total of $316 million, solidly within the pre-sale estimate of $247/$339 million. Almost 3,000 lots sourced from nearly 30 countries around the world were sold to buyers primarily from Asia but with worldwide competition. Solid prices were achieved throughout the sale series, which provided some of the best results at Sotheby's Hong Kong for Modern and Contemporary Southeast Asian Paintings, 20th Century Chinese Art, Contemporary Asian Art, Important Watches and Magnificent Jewels and Jadeite.

Press Release New York
SOTHEBY'S REPORTS SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST HALF 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
August 7, 2012, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today reported financial results for the second quarter and first half ended June 30, 2012.
Sotheby's reported second quarter 2012 net income of $85.4 million, a decrease of 33% from the prior year period, and total revenues of $303.9 million, down 18%, when compared to the prior year period. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, the Company reported net income of $74.8 million, a decrease of 42%, and total revenues of $408.9 million, down 16%, when compared to the prior year period. The lower levels of revenues and profitability in the current periods reflect a decrease in net auction sales when compared to the prior year periods and in particular, a 67% decline in single owner sales volume in the second quarter and a 55% decline in the first half.
The impact of the decline in total revenues is partially offset by reductions in total expenses of $13.6 million, or 8%, in the second quarter and $8.5 million, or 3%, in the first half. First half 2012 results are negatively impacted by incremental expense relating to resolution of the labor dispute with New York unionized art handlers, the bulk of which is for severance benefits to be paid to certain union members in exchange for their voluntary termination of employment. However, Sotheby's
1
Exhibit 99.1
management believes that future labor costs have been reset in an attractive and sustainable way.
Our operating results reflect some tremendous successes, but also reflect the challenging global economy, a tough comparison to the best quarter in Sotheby's history a year ago, and a competitive climate for high-end consignments, said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer. Demand and prices remain strong, especially at the high end of the market, as reflected in our highest ever sale of Impressionist and Modern Art of $373.3 million in May in New York.
We're pleased to report that our Financial Services business grew substantially in the first half of 2012 and private sales are an increasingly important contributor to our revenue stream. We have seen a slowdown in the Asian market alongside the economy there, but it continues to be very profitable and a source of substantial opportunity for Sotheby's.
Art appears to remain an attractive asset for collectors and our consignment pipeline for the Autumn season is very active at the moment. We remain confident in the global art market and will, as always, seek opportunities to broaden and extend the breadth and depth of our relationships with our clients, he added.
Second and Third Quarter Sales
Sotheby's made auction history when Edvard Munch's iconic masterpiece,
The Scream
, sold for $119.9 million at the Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale in New York in May - a new world record for any work of art at auction. The Evening Sale totaled $330.6 million, Sotheby's highest ever total for a sale of Impressionist and Modern Art Worldwide and the second highest total for a Sotheby's auction in any category.
In London in late May, Sotheby's offered the collection of the late photographer Gunter Sachs in a tremendously successful two-day sale that realized a total of $65.5 million, double the pre-sale low

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
From time to time in the ordinary course of its business, the Company will guarantee to consignors a minimum sale price in connection with the sale of property at auction. In the event that the property sells for less than the guaranteed price, the Company must perform under the auction guarantee by funding the difference between the sale price at auction and the amount of the auction guarantee. The Company is generally entitled to a share of the excess proceeds (the "overage") if the property under the auction guarantee sells above the guaranteed price. If the property does not sell, the amount of the auction guarantee must be paid, but the Company has the right to recover such amount through the future sale of the property. In these situations, the Company takes title to the guaranteed property, and it is recorded as Inventory on the Company's balance sheet at the lower of cost (i.e., the amount paid under the auction guarantee) or management's estimate of the property's net realizable value (i.e., expected sale price upon disposition). The sale proceeds ultimately realized by the Company in these situations may equal, exceed or be less than the amount recorded as Inventory on the Company's balance sheet.
Prior to 2009, the Company usually assumed the entire financial risk under its auction guarantees. However, beginning in 2009, the Company changed its strategy with respect to auction guarantees and generally enters into auction guarantees only when it is able to reduce its financial and liquidity exposure through contractual arrangements under which a counterparty contractually commits to bid a predetermined price on the guaranteed property (an "irrevocable bid"). If the irrevocable bid is the winning bid, the counterparty purchases the property at the predetermined price plus the applicable buyer's premium, which is the same amount that any other successful bidder would pay at that price. If the irrevocable bid is not the winning bid, the counterparty is generally entitled to receive a share of the auction commission earned on the sale and/or a share of any overage.
The counterparties to these irrevocable bids are typically third party major international art dealers or major art collectors. The Company could have credit exposure and potential losses in the event any of these counterparties do not perform according to the terms of these contractual arrangements.
As reported in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, as of July 30, 2012, the Company had no outstanding auction guarantees. On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into an auction guarantee in the amount of $50 million covering three items that will be offered at an auction in November 2012. The minimum guaranteed price under this auction guarantee is within the range of the aggregate pre-sale auction estimates for the underlying property. The Company's intent is to attempt to reduce the $50 million exposure under the auction guarantee through the use of irrevocable bids prior to the sale, which is consistent with the Company's approach to auction guarantees since 2009. However, the Company may not be able to obtain irrevocable bids on terms that are acceptable to the Company.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
1
Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On
September 3, 2012
, Sotheby's entered into a 10-year equity joint venture agreement (the Joint Venture Agreement) with Beijing GeHua Art Company, a Chinese State-Owned Enterprise that is part of GeHua Cultural and Development Group (GeHua). Establishment of the joint venture is subject to approval from the Chinese government; there can be no assurance that such approval will be received.
The Joint Venture Agreement will allow Sotheby's to take advantage of a planned free port project that GeHua is developing within the Tianzhu Free Trade Zone in Beijing (the Beijing Free Port), which will serve as a tax-advantaged storage location and provide a platform for art-related auctions and private selling exhibitions of non-cultural relics, travelling exhibitions, and educational activities. The date of completion of the Beijing Free Port and the commencement and scope of any storage, auction or private selling activities by the joint venture, as well as any earnings or losses resulting from the operation of the joint venture, are uncertain. However, management believes that the Joint Venture Agreement will strategically enhance Sotheby's long-term presence in mainland China and allow it to potentially capitalize on the opportunities presented by the Chinese art market, which Sotheby's currently serves through its existing operations in Hong Kong. (See statement on Forward Looking Statements.)
In addition to operating in the Beijing Free Port, under certain conditions the Joint Venture Agreement permits the joint venture to conduct both auctions and private selling exhibitions within other designated venues in Beijing.
During the term of the Joint Venture Agreement, GeHua will not allow any other company to conduct auctions, or specified competitors to conduct selling exhibitions, within its authorized areas of the Beijing Free Port and is restricted from partnering with any specified competitors to hold auctions or private selling exhibitions outside the Beijing Free Port. Sotheby's is not restricted by the Joint Venture Agreement from holding auctions in China through separate subsidiaries.
Upon approval of the Joint Venture Agreement by the Chinese government, Sotheby's will initially invest $1.2 million in exchange for 80% ownership of the joint venture, while GeHua will invest $0.3 million in exchange for 20% ownership. The Board of Directors of the joint venture consists of five members, with four members (including the Chairman) appointed by Sotheby's. Structural changes to the joint venture require the unanimous vote of the Board of Directors, while all other decisions require a super majority of two-thirds of the vote. In addition, Sotheby's will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the joint venture.
The Joint Venture Agreement may be immediately terminated by either Sotheby's or GeHua in the event: (i) of the unauthorized transfer or pledge of shares of the joint venture, (ii) one of the parties to the agreement has not taken steps to ensure compliance with Chinese laws, (iii) of non-compliance with Chinese or international anti-corruption laws, in particular, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, (iv) of material breach of contract, (v) of non-agreed changes to the joint venture arising from the Chinese government approval process, or (vi) of a change in control of the other party. In addition, upon 30 days' notice, the Joint Venture Agreement may be terminated by either Sotheby's or GeHua in the event: (i) Sotheby's loses control of the joint venture for any reason, (ii) the joint venture loses more than 20,000,000 RMB (approximately $3.1 million), (iii) ceases to carry on business or becomes unable to pay its debts as they become due, (iv) capital contributions are not made when due, or (v) upon standard force majeure events.
Sotheby's may immediately terminate the Joint Venture Agreement in the event: (i) of revocation of GeHua's right to develop the Beijing Free Port, (ii) of non-approval of the joint venture by the Chinese government, (iii) of a failure to receive or revocation of the joint venture's auction license in China, (iv) of revocation of the bonded status of the Tianzhu Free Trade Zone or the Beijing Free Port, or (iv) of termination by Sotheby's of its trademark license with the joint venture. In addition, Sotheby's has an option that allows it to put its joint venture ownership interest to GeHua at any time during the term of the Joint Venture Agreement at a price in excess of its initial investment in the Joint Venture.
Because the joint venture is a foreign-invested enterprise under Chinese law, all changes in shareholding and constitution of the joint venture will be subject to approval by the Chinese government, including in the event Sotheby's is seeking to terminate the Joint Venture Agreement, exercise its put option, or wind up the joint venture. Accordingly, Sotheby's ability to activate and operate the joint venture and enforce the Joint Venture Agreement provisions could be constrained by the Chinese government and other unforeseen circumstances.

ITEM: Other Events
Item 8.01 Other Events
On August 17, 2012, Sotheby's filed a Form 8-K under Item 2.03, "Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant," reporting that it had entered into an auction guarantee in the amount of $50 million covering three items that will be offered at an auction in November 2012. The minimum guaranteed price under this auction guarantee is within the range of the aggregate pre-sale auction estimates for the underlying property.
On
September 17, 2012
, Sotheby's entered into an irrevocable bid arrangement with an unrelated counterparty who has contractually committed to bid a predetermined price on the most significant lot under the guarantee, thereby reducing Sotheby's exposure by approximately 50%. Sotheby's intent is to attempt to reduce the remaining
exposure under this auction guarantee through the use of additional irrevocable bids prior to the sale, which is consistent with Sotheby's approach to auction guarantees since 2009. However, Sotheby's may not be able to obtain additional irrevocable bids on terms that are acceptable to Sotheby's. Any further irrevocable bid arrangements entered into with respect to this auction guarantee will be reported on Sotheby's next periodic filing on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2012.

Schedule A
The Registrar shall retain copies of all letters, notices and other written communications received pursuant to Section 2.07 or this Section 2.08.

SECTION 2.09. .

If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity bond must be furnished that is sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee or any Agent from any loss or liability that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced and subsequently presented or claimed for payment. The Company may charge such Holder for its expenses and the expenses of the Trustee in replacing a Note. In case any such mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may pay such Note instead of issuing a new Note in replacement thereof.
Replacement Notes
provided
Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
SECTION 2.10. . Notes outstanding at any time are all Notes that have been authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.10 as not outstanding.
Outstanding Notes
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.09, it ceases to be outstanding unless and until the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser.
If the Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on the Maturity Date money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes cease to be outstanding and interest on them shall cease to accrue.
A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its Affiliates holds such Note, , that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Notes owned by the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes or any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, only Notes which the Trustee has actual knowledge to be so owned shall be so disregarded. Notes so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes or any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor.
provided, however

After the preparation of definitive Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Notes of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Notes.

The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in "CUSIP," "CINS" or "ISIN" numbers for the Notes.

Limitation on Liens
The foregoing restriction shall not apply to, and there shall be excluded from Indebtedness in any computation under such restriction, Indebtedness secured by:
(i) Permitted Liens;

provided, however,
For purposes of determining what category of excluded Liens in the foregoing paragraphs, or the next paragraph in which any Lien shall be included, the Company in its sole discretion may classify such Lien on the date of its incurrence and later reclassify all or a portion of such Lien in any manner that complies with this covenant.

(iii) the Company or such Subsidiary within 180 days after the sale of property or assets in connection with such Sale and Leaseback Transaction is completed, applies an amount equal to the greater of (A) the net proceeds of the sale of such property or assets or (B) the Fair Market Value of such property or assets to (i) the permanent retirement of Notes, other Indebtedness of the Company ranking on a parity with the Notes or Indebtedness of a Subsidiary or (ii) the acquisition of different property, facilities or equipment or the expansion of the Company's existing business, including the acquisition of other businesses or capital expenditures; or
(iv) the Attributable Debt of the Company and its Subsidiary in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction and all other Sale and Leaseback Transactions entered into after the Closing Date (other than any such Sale and Leaseback Transaction as would be permitted as described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 4.04), plus the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness secured by Liens then outstanding (not including any such Indebtedness secured by Liens described in clauses (i) through (vi) of the second paragraph of Section 4.03) which do not equally and ratably secure the Notes (or secure Notes on a basis that is prior to other Indebtedness secured thereby), would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Tangible Assets.
For purposes of determining the applicable category of permitted Sale and Leaseback Transactions in the foregoing clauses, the Company in its sole discretion may classify such Sale and Leaseback Transaction on the date of its incurrence and later reclassify all or a portion of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction in any manner that complies with this covenant.
SECTION 4.05. . The Company must commence, within 30 days of the occurrence of a Change of Control, and consummate an Offer to Purchase for all Notes then outstanding, at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, to the Payment Date.

Acceleration
provided
however
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes solely because an Event of Default described in clause (e) of Section 6.01 has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded and annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (e) of Section 6.01 shall be remedied or cured by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 90 business days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if the rescission and annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Trustee for the payment of amounts due on the Notes.

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
Waiver of Past Defaults
SECTION 6.05. . The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

Such limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note directly (as opposed to through the Trustee) for enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.
Limitation on Suits
For purposes of Section 6.05 of this Indenture and this Section 6.06, the Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 316(a) in making any determination of whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes have concurred in any request or direction of the Trustee to pursue any remedy available to the Trustee or the Holders with respect to this Indenture or the Notes or otherwise under the law.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over such other Holder.
SECTION 6.07. .

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to empower the Trustee to authorize or consent to, or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder, any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim

Undertaking for Costs
 
SECTION 6.12. . If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then, and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Company, Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Restoration of Rights and Remedies
SECTION 6.13. . Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Notes in Section 2.09, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.

If any amount shall be paid to a Subsidiary Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Subsidiary Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Holders, and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders to be credited and applied upon the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes.

Obligations Unconditional
Without limiting the foregoing, nothing contained in this Article Ten will restrict the right of the Trustee or the Holders to take any action to declare the Note Guarantee to be due and payable prior to the Stated Maturity of any Notes pursuant to Section 6.02 or to pursue any rights or remedies hereunder.

(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary Guarantor in the Indenture (other than a covenant or agreement a default in whose performance or whose breach is specifically dealt with in clauses (1), (2), or (3) above), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof has been given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes;
(5) a default or defaults under any bonds, debentures, notes or other evidences of Indebtedness (other than the Notes) by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary having, individually or in the aggregate, a principal or similar amount outstanding of at least $75.0 million, whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default or defaults shall have resulted in the acceleration of the maturity of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity or shall constitute a failure to pay at least $75.0 million of such Indebtedness when due and payable after the expiration of any applicable grace period with respect thereto;
(6) the entry against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of a final judgment or final judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $75.0 million, by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction, which judgments remain undischarged, unwaived, unstayed, unbonded or unsatisfied for a period of 60 consecutive days; or

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (7) above with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of the Notes and any accrued interest on the Notes to be due and payable immediately by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders); , , that after such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, have been cured or waived as provided in this Indenture.
provided
however
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes solely because an Event of Default described in clause (5) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded and annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness if the rescission and annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Trustee for the payment of amounts due on the Notes.
If an Event of Default specified in clause (7) above occurs with respect to the Company, the principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding shall ipso facto become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Prior to an acceleration described above, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes, by notice to the Trustee, may waive, on behalf of the Holders of all notes any past default or Event of Default, except as set forth under Sections 6.04 and 9.02 of the Indenture. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any Default (except Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest) if the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders to do so.

The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from and perform services for the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or their Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or their Affiliates as if it were not the Trustee.
 
No incorporator or any past, present or future partner, stockholder, other equityholder, officer, director, employee or controlling person, as such, of the Company or of any successor Person shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 6, 2012, Sotheby's filed a Form 8-K under Item 1.01, Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement, reporting that it had entered into a 10-year equity joint venture agreement (the Joint Venture Agreement) with Beijing GeHua Art Company (GeHua) relating to art-related auctions and private selling exhibitions of non-cultural relics, travelling exhibitions and educational activities at a planned free port project that GeHua is developing within the Tianzhu Free Trade Zone in Beijing (the Beijing Free Port).  The September 6, 2012 Form 8-K noted, among other terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, that (i) during the term of the Joint Venture Agreement GeHua will not allow any other company to conduct auctions, or specified competitors to conduct selling exhibitions, within its authorized areas of the Beijing Free Port and is restricted from partnering with any specified competitors to hold auctions or private selling exhibitions outside the Beijing Free Port; (ii) the Joint Venture Agreement may be immediately terminated on the occurrence of certain listed events; and (iii) Sotheby's has an option that allows it to put its joint venture ownership interest to GeHua at any time during the term of the Joint Venture Agreement at a price in excess of its initial investment in the joint venture.  It also noted that the establishment of the joint venture and the exercise of Sotheby's rights to terminate the Joint Venture Agreement are subject to approval from the Chinese government.
On September 26, 2012, in response to comments received from the Beijing Commerce Commission, a governmental authority reviewing the Joint Venture Agreement, Sotheby's and GeHua amended the Joint Venture Agreement dated September 3, 2012 to provide that: (i) during the term of the Joint Venture Agreement GeHua will not cooperate with any other company to conduct auctions, or specified competitors to conduct commission sales, within its authorized areas of the Beijing Free Port and other locations in which it may be authorised to manage and operate a bonded auction business, and is restricted from partnering with any specified competitors to hold auctions or commission sales in the PRC outside such areas; (ii) within 30 days of the occurrence of a listed dissolution event (previously described as a termination event), (a) Sotheby's may put its joint venture ownership interest to GeHua at a price in excess of its initial investment in the joint venture, or (b) the parties shall execute a termination agreement and apply to the Beijing authorities for dissolution of the joint venture; and (iii) Sotheby's may at any time during the term of the Joint Venture Agreement offer to transfer its joint venture ownership interest to GeHua, which offer GeHua may either (a) accept at a price in excess of Sotheby's initial investment in the joint venture, or (b) decline, in which case Sotheby's and GeHua shall apply to the authorities to terminate the Joint Venture Agreement.  The other material terms of the Joint Venture Agreement remain unchanged.
On September 26, 2012, the Beijing Commerce Commission completed its review of and approved the proposed Joint Venture Agreement between Sotheby's and GeHua, and issued the foreign investment letter of approval, the foreign investment certificate of approval and the auction license to the joint venture. On September 26, 2012, the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce issued the business license to the joint venture to commence operations. On September 27, 2012, the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce Shunyi Branch completed the pre-auction recordal and the joint venture's first auction occurred later that day.

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release New York
SOTHEBY'S REPORTS THIRD QUARTER AND
FIRST NINE MONTHS 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
November 8, 2012, New York -- Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today reported financial results for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30, 2012.
Sotheby's reported third quarter 2012 revenues increased 18%, to $68.5 million, driven by a $4.9 million, or 50% improvement in private sale commission revenues and a $1.6 million, or 56% increase in Finance segment revenues. Largely due to these revenue increases, the Company reported a pre-tax loss of ($46.4) million for the quarter, compared to a pre-tax loss of ($57.9) million in the prior year - an $11.5 million, or 20% improvement.
For the three months ended September 30, 2012, Sotheby's reported a net loss of ($32.6) million, which reflects a slight $2.8 million deterioration from the prior year due to an $11.6 million tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2011 as a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance against certain of Sotheby's deferred tax assets.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, third quarter Auction Sales have historically represented approximately 7%-10% of annual Auction Sales resulting in a loss period for the Company. Third quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
1
Exhibit 99.1
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, Sotheby's net income declined $57.7 million, or 58%, when compared to the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to lower auction commission revenues resulting from a $433.5 million, or 16%, reduction in Net Auction Sales, compared to a 2011 period with an historically unprecedented level of single owner sales. The decline in year-to-date auction commission revenues is partially offset by an $8.2 million, or 17%, increase in private sale commission revenues and a $6.4 million decrease in Dealer Segment inventory writedowns, as well as $4.5 million of charges recorded in 2011 from restructuring actions to streamline Sotheby's European selling operations.
In September, Sotheby's successfully issued $300 million in ten year notes at 5.25% which is far below the existing effective interest rate for Sotheby's current high yield debt of 7.83%. The net proceeds of the issuance of these notes will be used to redeem all of the outstanding ($80 million) 7.75% Senior Notes in November 2012 and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other existing indebtedness. The Company intends to utilize $181.9 million of the net proceeds to settle the 3.125% Convertible Notes, which mature in June 2013.
Sotheby's continues to see considerable demand for precious works of art, said Bill Ruprecht, President and Chief Executive Officer. Our sales in London last month brought record results and starting this evening and in the coming weeks, we will offer for sale the finest collection of paintings, drawings, sculpture and jewels available in the world - including a number of rare works that we are very excited about. The art market remains quite robust, especially at the high end.
Fourth Quarter Sales To Date
Sotheby's launched the fourth quarter with a series of sales in Hong Kong that took place early last month. Over 3,150 lots were sold over the five days of auctions bringing a total of $261.9 million,
2
Exhibit 99.1
towards the high end of the pre-sale estimate range of $212/$287 million but below the Fall 2011 level of $410.8 million. For traditional Chinese art categories, the Fine Chinese Paintings sale doubled the pre-sale estimate, and in the Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art sale, a pair of enameled double-gourd vases from the Qianlong period brought the extraordinary price of $13.7 million. Auction records were set for a Southeast Asian painting, the artist Lee Man Fong, as well as the contemporary Chinese artist Liu Wei. Also achieved were the strongest total for a wine sale series in Hong Kong in 2012, a record for a various-owner sale of watches at Sotheby's worldwide as well as the sale of an 88.88 carat diamond necklace for a remarkable $5.1 million.
In conjunction with Frieze week in London in October, our Contemporary and Italian Art sales brought excellent results. The week series totaled $112.1 million, at the high end of the pre-sale estimate and a record total for a London October sales series in the category. Highlighting the sales was Gerhard Richter's
Abstraktes Bild
from the collection of Eric Clapton which also earned a record for the artist at auction when it sold for $34.9 million.
Upcoming Sales
Tonight in New York, at our evening sale of Impressionist and Modern Art, are two legendary portraits of Pablo Picasso's mistress Marie-Thrse Walter,
Nature Morte aux Tulipes
and
Femme  la Fentre
(pre-sale estimates of $35/$50 million and $15/$20 million, respectively). The former was painted in 1932, which has been recognized as the pinnacle of Picasso's near-century long production while the latter is part of a group of works that have come to epitomize Surrealist figurative painting at its most impassioned and dramatic. The auction is further distinguished by works from both prominent estates and important American museum collections, including works by Paul Czanne, Henry Moore, Claude Monet and more. The total pre-sale estimate for the evening sale is $173/$251 million.
3
Exhibit 99.1
Next week in New York, Sotheby's Contemporary Art sales are highlighted by Mark Rothko's
No. 1 (Royal Red and Blue)
. The large scale masterpiece was one of eight works chosen by Rothko for his landmark solo show in 1954 at the Art Institute of Chicago (pre-sale estimate of $35/$50 million). Also featured in the sale is Jackson Pollock's
Number 4, 1951
, a rare drip painting on canvas (pre-sale estimate of $25/35 million) and one of the most important versions of Francis Bacon's iconic Pope Paintings ever to have appeared at auction,
Untitled (Pope)
(pre-sale estimate of $18/25 million). The total sale series carries a pre-sale estimate of $363/$502 million.
Note: Estimates do not include buyer's premium. Sale totals for auctions discussed in this release include buyer's premium.

SOTHEBY'S INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND ACCELERATES PAYMENT OF TWO QUARTERS OF DIVIDENDS
December 6, 2012
, New York -- The Board of Directors of Sotheby's (NYSE:BID), consistent with its frequent review of the Company's dividend payments, has declared an accelerated first and second quarter of 2013 cash dividend totaling $0.20 per share of outstanding common stock. This $0.10 per share per quarter dividend reflects a 25% increase from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. This accelerated dividend is intended by the Board to be in lieu of quarterly dividends Sotheby's would have otherwise announced in the first and second quarters of 2013, and that would have been paid in calendar year 2013.
Management recommended the acceleration of these dividends in recognition of the strong liquidity and ongoing strength of Sotheby's and in light of the future uncertainties surrounding U.S. tax policies, said William Sheridan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sotheby's.
This accelerated dividend will be payable on, or before, December 31, 2012 to holders of record as of December 26, 2012.

SOTHEBY'S NAMES WILLIAM F. RUPRECHT CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN ADDITION TO HIS ROLE AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Michael I. Sovern To Remain on Board After 13 Years of Invaluable Service as Chairman
Steven B. Dodge Unanimously Appointed Lead Independent Director of Sotheby's
NEW YORK, 13 December 2012 - Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today announced that the Board of Directors unanimously elected William F. Ruprecht Chairman of the Board of Directors, a role he will assume in addition to his current duties as President and Chief Executive Officer. Michael I. Sovern, who has served as Chairman of the Board for 13 years, will remain on the Board. Steven B. Dodge was unanimously approved by the Board as Lead Independent Director. The appointments are effective immediately.
Serving as Chairman of the Board at Sotheby's has been an extraordinary privilege, said Mr. Sovern. We have accomplished a great deal together and I am very proud of the standard of excellence Sotheby's represents today in the art world and, most importantly, with our clients. We are extremely fortunate that Bill Ruprecht can step seamlessly into the role as Chairman. The Board and I have been contemplating my decision to step down as Chairman for about a year now and we looked both internally and externally at suitable structures and candidates. Bill is clearly the best long-term choice for Sotheby's and its shareholders. There is no one more prepared and knowledgeable about Sotheby's and all that this company represents and what it can become, so I turn this seat over to him with great confidence in the future.

Exhibit 99.1
Mr. Sovern began his tenure as Chairman of Sotheby's in February 2000. As President Emeritus of Columbia University, he brought a distinguished reputation as an accomplished lawyer, scholar and educational leader to the Sotheby's Board at a critical period. Mr. Sovern's leadership and integrity helped steer Sotheby's successfully through its antitrust matter and its two class capital structure and enabled the Company to enjoy the most prosperous period in its almost 270 year history.
Mr. Ruprecht assumes the role of Chairman today after a 32-year career at Sotheby's that has taken him from an administrator's post in the Rug department to head of a global organization that has reached $6 billion in sales and operates in 40 countries, with clients from 95 nations and principal salesrooms in New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong.
Mr. Ruprecht was named President and CEO in February 2000 at the same time Mr. Sovern was appointed Chairman. Prior to that, Mr. Ruprecht served as Managing Director of Sotheby's North & South America for six years. During his tenure as President and CEO, Sotheby's has increased its global focus on top clients and the high end of the business as well as 'emerging' markets - whether in Asia, the Middle East, Russia or Latin America. The Company, under his leadership, has also seen an expansion in art-related financing, private sales of major works of art and in its digital presence as Sotheby's strives to build client loyalty through innovation and impeccable service.
This is an exciting and challenging time in the world and at Sotheby's. I accept this appointment with gratitude and humble thanks to the Board and to Michael for all he has done, especially the sterling example of leadership that I and all future chairs will call upon, said Mr. Ruprecht. I am deeply appreciative of the senior leadership at Sotheby's. Their collective strengths, intelligence, amazing passion and commitment to this business are the ingredients that make this a unique and superb organization.

Exhibit 99.1
Mr. Dodge today assumes a role that is new to the Sotheby's Board, although he is a veteran of Company leadership, having served as a Director from 2000 to 2007. Mr. Dodge is the CEO and principal of a private real estate development and construction company, Windover Development LLC, and for almost a decade, until 2004, he served as Chairman of the Board of American Tower Corporation and as President and Chief Executive Officer of that company until 2003. Prior to American Tower, Mr. Dodge served as the Chairman, President, and CEO of American Radio Systems Corporation.
In his role as Lead Independent Director, Mr. Dodge is responsible for a series of leadership duties, including presiding at Executive Sessions of the non-management directors, serving as a liaison between the Chairman and the directors, and shaping the agendas for meetings of the Board.
The position was created to ensure that Sotheby's meets the highest standards of contemporary corporate governance. Mr. Dodge said, Sotheby's will continue to be committed to the highest level of transparency and Board independence on my watch, as currently evidenced by the fact that only one of our twelve Board members is from Management.
Mr. Ruprecht applauded the selection of Mr. Dodge, saying, Steve Dodge is a superb choice as Lead Independent Director and has a proven track record of building organizations and developing talent. He is an effective and independent Director, a true consensus builder, and I very much look forward to working with him in his new role as Lead Independent Director.

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On August 31, 2009, Sotheby's and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, Sotheby's) entered into a credit agreement (the Existing Credit Agreement) with an international syndicate of lenders led by General Electric Capital, Corporate Finance (GE Capital). The Existing Credit Agreement, among other things, provided for a credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), subject to a borrowing base, as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement. Prior to the date of this filing, the Existing Credit Agreement had been amended several times to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the original agreement to September 1, 2014 and provide additional flexibility to Sotheby's.
On December 19, 2012, Sotheby's, GE Capital, and the lenders named therein amended and restated the Existing Credit Agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement) to, among other things, further extend the maturity date to December 19, 2017, increase the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility to $300 million, and provide further flexibility to Sotheby's. The A&R Credit Agreement retains the existing accordion feature whereby from the date of the A&R Credit Agreement until June 19, 2017, Sotheby's may request to increase the borrowing capacity of the A&R Credit Agreement by an amount not to exceed $50 million.
The following summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the A&R Credit Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the A&R Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Form 8-K have the meanings set forth in the A&R Credit Agreement.
The A&R Credit Agreement, among other things:
Sotheby's incurred approximately $2.5 million in fees related to the A&R Credit Agreement, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the extended term of the A&R Credit Agreement.

1.
AMOUNT AND TERMS OF CREDIT
(a)
    
Revolving Credit Facility
.
(i)
    
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, (a) each Lender agrees to make available, from time to time until the Commitment Termination Date, its Pro Rata Share of advances (each, a 
Dollar Revolving Credit Advance
) in Dollars to Domestic Borrowers and (b) except as otherwise provided in the last two sentences of this paragraph, each of the Foreign Currency Lenders and the Fronting Lender agrees to make available, from time to time until the Commitment Termination Date, its Pro Rata Share (or, in the case of the Fronting Lender, the Fronted Percentage) of advances (each a 
Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advance
) in Foreign Currencies to the Foreign Borrowers. Each Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall purchase an undivided participation interest in each such Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advance made by the Fronting Lender in accordance with
Section 9.9(e)(i)
. The Fronting Lender shall not be required to, and shall not, fund its share of any Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advance at any time that any condition precedent set forth in
Section 2.2
is not satisfied if the Fronting Lender shall have received at least one Business Days prior written notice from Non-Foreign Currency Lenders having Commitments equal to or greater than 66 2/3% of the Fronted Percentage instructing it not to fund its share of a Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advance. The Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Revolving Loan of any Lender shall not at any time exceed its separate Commitment. The obligations of each Lender to make Loans or purchase participation interests therein under this Agreement shall be several and not joint. Until the Commitment Termination Date, Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow under this
Section 1.1(a)
;
provided
, that (i) the amount of any Revolving Credit Advance to be made at any time to a Domestic Borrower shall not exceed Domestic Borrowing Availability at such time and (ii) the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of any Revolving Credit Advance to be made at any time to a Foreign Borrower shall not exceed Foreign Borrowing Availability at such time. The Dollar Equivalent of each outstanding Revolving Credit Advance, Swing Line Advance and Letter of Credit Obligation shall be recalculated hereunder on each date on which it shall be necessary to determine the Revolving Loan Outstandings, as determined by Agent in its sole discretion;
provided
, that Agent shall recalculate the Dollar Equivalent of the Revolving Loan Outstandings at least one time each calendar month and otherwise in accordance with
Section 1.18
. Domestic Borrowing Availability or Foreign Borrowing Availability, or both, may be reduced by Reserves imposed by Agent in its sole reasonable credit judgment. Each Revolving Credit Advance shall be made on notice by Borrower Representative to one of the representatives of Agent identified in
Schedule 1.1
at the address specified therein. Any such notice must be given no later than (x) 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day of the proposed Revolving Credit Advance, in
2
the case of an Index Rate Loan in Dollars or (y) 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date which is three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed Revolving Credit Advance, in the case of a LIBOR Loan. Each such notice (a 
Notice of Revolving Credit Advance
) must be given in writing (by telecopy or overnight courier) substantially in the form of
Exhibit 1.1(a)(i)
, and shall include the information required in such Exhibit and such other information as may be required by Agent. If any Borrower desires to have any Revolving Credit Advance be made as a LIBOR Loan, Borrower Representative must comply with
Section 1.5(e)
. A Revolving Credit Advance may not be drawn in a Foreign Currency if Agent determines at any time prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of such proposed Revolving Credit Advance that by reason of any change in currency availability, unusual instability in currency exchange rates or exchange controls it is, or will be, impracticable for such Revolving Credit Advance to be made in such Foreign Currency. In such event, the proposed Revolving Credit Advance shall be made in Dollars.
(ii)
    
Except as provided in
Section 1.12
, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Lender a note to evidence the Commitment of, and Revolving Credit Advances made by, that Lender. Each note shall be in the principal amount of the Commitment of the applicable Lender, dated the Restatement Effective Date (or such later date as such Lender becomes party to this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(a)
or modifies its Commitment pursuant to
Section 9.1(a)
) and substantially in the form of
Exhibit 1.1(a)(ii)-A
(in the case of the Domestic Borrowers) or
Exhibit 1.1(a)(ii)-B
(in the case of the Foreign Borrowers) (each a 
Revolving Note
 and, collectively, the 
Revolving Notes
). Each Revolving Note shall represent the joint and several obligation of the applicable Borrowers to pay the amount of the applicable Lenders Commitment or, if less, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Credit Advances made to the Domestic Borrowers or the Foreign Borrowers, as applicable, together with interest thereon as prescribed in
Section 1.5
. In addition, each Foreign Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Fronting Lender a note to evidence the obligation of, and Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances made by, the Fronting Lender. Such note shall be in the principal amount of the Foreign Currency Subfacility Limit dated the Restatement Effective Date (or such later date as such Person shall become the Fronting Lender pursuant to
Section 9.7(b)
) and substantially in the form of
Exhibit 1.1(a)(ii)-C
(the 
Fronting Lender Note
). The Fronting Lender Note shall represent the joint and several obligation of the Foreign Borrowers to pay the Fronted Percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances made to the Foreign Borrowers, together with interest thereon as prescribed in
Section 1.5
. The entire unpaid balance of the aggregate Revolving Loan and all other non-contingent Obligations shall be immediately due and payable in full in immediately available funds on the Commitment Termination Date.
(iii)
    
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at the request of Borrower Representative, in its discretion Agent may (but shall have absolutely no obligation to), make Revolving Credit Advances (i) to Domestic Borrowers on behalf of Lenders in Dollars in amounts that cause the sum of (a) the aggregate outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Advances and Swing Line Advances outstanding to the Domestic Borrowers
plus
(b) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding amount of Letter of Credit Obligations incurred for the benefit of any Domestic Borrowers to exceed the Domestic Borrowing Base or (ii) to Foreign Borrowers on behalf of the Foreign Currency Lenders and the Fronting Lender in any
3
Foreign Currency in amounts that cause the sum of (a) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Advances and Swing Line Advances outstanding to the Foreign Borrowers
plus
(b) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding amount of Letter of Credit Obligations incurred for the benefit of any Foreign Borrowers to exceed the Foreign Borrowing Base (any such excess Revolving Credit Advances are herein referred to collectively as 
Overadvances
);
provided
, that (A) no such event or occurrence shall cause or constitute a waiver of Agents, Swing Line Lenders, Fronting Lenders or Lenders right to refuse to make any further Overadvances, Swing Line Advances or Revolving Credit Advances, or incur any Letter of Credit Obligations, as the case may be, at any time that an Overadvance exists and (B) no Overadvance shall result in a Default or Event of Default based on Borrowers failure to comply with
Section 1.3(b)(ii)
for so long as Agent permits such Overadvance to be outstanding, but solely with respect to the amount of such Overadvance. In addition, Overadvances may be made even if the conditions to lending set forth in
Section 2.2
have not been met. All Overadvances shall constitute Index Rate Loans (in the case of Overadvances denominated in Dollars) or LIBOR Loans having a one-month LIBOR Period (in the case of Overadvances denominated in any Foreign Currency), shall bear interest at the Default Rate and shall be payable on the earlier of demand or the Commitment Termination Date. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 1.11(b)
, the authority of Agent to make Overadvances is limited to an aggregate amount not to exceed a Dollar Equivalent of $20,000,000 at any time, shall not cause the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate Revolving Loan to exceed the Maximum Amount, and may be revoked prospectively by a written notice to Agent signed by the Requisite Lenders;
provided further
, that Overadvances made other than for the purpose of protecting or preserving the Collateral shall not remain outstanding for more than sixty (60) days without the written consent of Requisite Lenders. Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to Lenders following the making of an Overadvance (unless one or more Overadvances are already outstanding as of the date of such Overadvance).
(iv)
    
From the Restatement Effective Date until June 19, 2017, the Borrowers may request that any additional Person(s) may become party hereto as a Lender and provide additional Commitments or any Lender may agree to increase its Commitment (any such Person or Lender, an 
Increase Lender
) pursuant to a joinder agreement (an 
Incremental Joinder
) in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Agent;
provided
that (A) the aggregate amount of all such additional Commitments or increases in the Commitments of the Increase Lenders under this
Section 1.1(a)(iv)
does not exceed $50,000,000 and (B) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. The Incremental Joinder may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of Agent and the Borrowers, to effect the provisions of this
Section 1.1(a)(iv)
. The consent of Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed in the case of any Qualified Assignee) shall be required prior to the addition of any Person as a Lender or the increase of the Commitment of any Lender pursuant to this
Section 1.1(a)(iv)
. Each Increase Lender shall accept an assignment from the existing Lenders (and the Fronting Lender, as applicable), and each such existing Lender (and the Fronting Lender, as applicable) shall make a ratable assignment to such Increase Lender, of an interest in the Revolving Loan Outstandings such that, after giving effect thereto, the Revolving Loan Outstandings shall be held ratably by the Lenders (including the Increase Lenders). Assignments
4
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be automatic after giving effect to any addition of any Person as a Lender or any increase of the Commitment of any Lender, in either case pursuant to this
Section 1.1(a)(iv)
, and shall be made in exchange for the principal amount assigned plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any accrued and unpaid Fees in respect thereof. In addition, each applicable Borrower shall pay any LIBOR breakage costs due to any existing Lender in accordance with
Section 1.13(b)
(with any payment to any existing Lender in respect of the assignment of any principal amount of any Loan pursuant to this
Section 1.1(a)(iv)
being treated as a repayment of a Loan for purposes of such
Section 1.13(b)
).
(b)
    
Swing Line Facility
.
(i)
    
Agent shall notify the Swing Line Lender upon Agents receipt of any Notice of Revolving Credit Advance in respect of a Revolving Credit Advance (a) to be denominated in Dollars and to bear interest by reference to the Dollar Index Rate, (b) to be denominated in Sterling and to bear interest by reference to the Sterling Index Rate or (c) to be denominated in Hong Kong Dollars and to bear interest by reference to the Hong Kong Dollars Index Rate. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender may, but shall have no duty to, in accordance with any such notice, make available from time to time until the Commitment Termination Date advances (each, a 
Swing Line Advance
) (a) in Dollars to the Domestic Borrowers or (b) in any Foreign Currency to the Foreign Borrowers. The provisions of this
Section 1.1(b)
shall not relieve Lenders or the Fronting Lender of their obligations to make Revolving Credit Advances under
Section 1.1(a)
;
provided
, that if the Swing Line Lender makes a Swing Line Advance pursuant to any such notice, such Swing Line Advance shall be in lieu of any Revolving Credit Advance that otherwise may be made by the Lenders or the Fronting Lender pursuant to such notice. The aggregate amount of Swing Line Advances outstanding shall not exceed at any time the Swing Line Availability as of such time. Until the Commitment Termination Date, the Borrowers may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow under this
Section 1.1(b)
. Each Swing Line Advance shall be made pursuant to a Notice of Revolving Credit Advance delivered to Agent by Borrower Representative on behalf of the applicable Borrower in accordance with
Section 1.1(a)
. Any such notice must be given no later than (x) 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day of the proposed Swing Line Advance, in the case of a Swing Line Advance in Dollars or (y) 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date which is (A) two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed Swing Line Advance, in the case of a Swing Line Advance denominated in Sterling and (B) three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed Swing Line Advance, in the case of a Swing Line Advance denominated in Hong Kong Dollars. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received at least one Business Days prior written notice from Requisite Lenders instructing it not to make a Swing Line Advance, the Swing Line Lender shall, notwithstanding the failure of any condition precedent set forth in
Sections 2.2
, be entitled to fund that Swing Line Advance, and to have each Lender make Revolving Credit Advances in accordance with
Section 1.1(b)(iii)
or
1.1(b)(iv)
, as applicable, or purchase participating interests in accordance with
Section 1.1(b)(v)
. If any Lender shall fail to make available to Agent its Pro Rata Share (or, in the case of any Swing Line Advance in any Foreign Currency, the Fronting Lender shall fail to make available the Fronted Percentage) of any Revolving Credit Advance in accordance with
Section 1.1(b)(iii)
or
1.1(b)(iv)
, as applicable, Borrowers shall repay the
5
outstanding principal amount of the portion of the Swing Line Loan then outstanding due to such failure upon demand therefor by Agent.
(ii)
    
Each Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Swing Line Lender a promissory note to evidence the Swing Line Commitment. Such note shall be in the principal amount of the Swing Line Commitment of the Swing Line Lender, dated the Restatement Effective Date and substantially in the form of
Exhibit 1.1(b)(ii)-A
(in the case of the Domestic Borrowers) or
Exhibit 1.1(b)(ii)-B
(in the case of the Foreign Borrowers) (each, a 
Swing Line Note
 and, collectively, the 
Swing Line Notes
). Each Swing Line Note shall represent the joint and several obligation of the applicable Borrowers to pay the amount of the Swing Line Commitment or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Swing Line Advances made to the Domestic Borrowers or the Foreign Borrowers, as applicable, together with interest thereon as prescribed in
Section 1.5
. The entire unpaid balance of the Swing Line Loan and all other noncontingent Obligations shall be immediately due and payable in full in immediately available funds on the Commitment Termination Date if not sooner paid in full.
(iii)
    
The Swing Line Lender, at any time and from time to time no less frequently than once weekly, shall on behalf of the Borrower Representative (and the Borrower Representative hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so act on its behalf) request each Lender (including the Swing Line Lender) to make available to the Domestic Borrowers its Pro Rata Share of a Revolving Credit Advance in Dollars equal to the principal amount of the portion of the Swing Line Loan denominated in Dollars and outstanding on the date such notice is given (the 
Refunded Dollar Swing Line Loan
). Unless any of the events described in
Sections 8.1(g)
or
8.1(h)
has occurred (in which event the procedures of
Section 1.1(b)(v)
shall apply) and regardless of whether the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement to the making of a Revolving Credit Advance are then satisfied, each Lender shall disburse directly to Agent its Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Credit Advance on behalf of the Swing Line Lender prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York time) in immediately available funds in Dollars on the Business Day next succeeding the date that notice is given. The proceeds of each such Revolving Credit Advance shall be immediately paid to the Swing Line Lender and applied to repay the Refunded Dollar Swing Line Loan.
(iv)
    
The Swing Line Lender, at any time and from time to time no less frequently than once weekly, shall on behalf of the Borrower Representative (and the Borrower Representative hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so act on its behalf) request each Foreign Currency Lender (including the Swing Line Lender, as applicable) and the Fronting Lender to make available to the Foreign Borrowers its Pro Rata Share (or, in the case of the Fronting Lender, the Fronted Percentage) of a Revolving Credit Advance in a Foreign Currency equal to the principal amount of the portion of the Swing Line Loan denominated in such Foreign Currency and outstanding on the date such notice is given (the 
Refunded Foreign Currency Swing Line Loan
). Unless any of the events described in
Sections 8.1(g)
or
8.1(h)
has occurred (in which event the procedures of
Section 1.1(b)(v)
shall apply) and regardless of whether the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement to the making of a Revolving Credit Advance are then satisfied, each Foreign Currency Lender and the Fronting Lender shall disburse directly to Agent its Pro Rata Share (or, in the case of the Fronting Lender, the Fronted
6
Percentage) of such Revolving Credit Advance on behalf of the Swing Line Lender prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York time) in immediately available funds in such Foreign Currency on the second Business Day next succeeding the date that notice is given. The proceeds of each such Revolving Credit Advance shall be immediately paid to the Swing Line Lender and applied to repay the Refunded Foreign Currency Swing Line Loan. Each Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall purchase an undivided participation interest in each such Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advance from the Fronting Lender in accordance with
Section 9.9(e)(i)
.
(v)
    
If, prior to refunding a portion of the Swing Line Loan with a Revolving Credit Advance pursuant to
Section 1.1(b)(iii)
or
1.1(b)(iv)
, one of the events described in
Sections 8.1(g)
or
8.1(h)
has occurred, then, subject to the provisions of

, purchase from the Swing Line Lender an undivided participation interest in the Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such portion of the Swing Line Loan. Upon request, each Lender shall promptly transfer to the Swing Line Lender, in immediately available funds in Dollars, the amount of each such participation interest; and
(B)
    
in the case of any portion of the Swing Line Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, each Foreign Currency Lender and the Fronting Lender shall, on the date such Revolving Credit Advance was to have been made pursuant to
Section 1.1(b)(iv)
, purchase from the Swing Line Lender an undivided participation interest in the Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share (or, in the case of the Fronting Lender, the Fronted Percentage) of such portion of the Swing Line Loan. Upon request, each Foreign Currency Lender and the Fronting Lender shall promptly transfer to the Swing Line Lender, in immediately available funds in such Foreign Currency, the amount of each such participation interest. Each Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall purchase an undivided participation interest in each such participation interest purchased by the Fronting Lender in accordance with
Section 9.9(e)(i)

Section 1.13(b)
if such conversion is made prior to the expiration of the LIBOR Period applicable thereto, or (iv) continue all or any portion of the outstanding Revolving Loan as a LIBOR Loan upon the expiration of the applicable LIBOR Period and the succeeding LIBOR Period of that continued portion of the outstanding Revolving Loan shall commence on the first day after the last day of the LIBOR Period of the portion of the outstanding Revolving Loan to be continued. Any portion of the outstanding Revolving Loan to be made or continued as, or converted into, a LIBOR Loan must be in a minimum amount of (i) if denominated in Dollars, $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess of such amount, (ii) if denominated in Sterling, 3,000,000 or an integral multiple of 500,000 in excess of such amount or (iii) if denominated in Hong Kong Dollars, HK$40,000,000 or an integral multiple of HK$8,000,000 in excess of such amount.

15

Section 2.2
shall not have been satisfied), (i) if such LIBOR Loan is denominated in Dollars, such LIBOR Loan shall be converted to an Index Rate Loan at the end of its LIBOR Period and (ii) if such LIBOR Loan is denominated in a Foreign Currency, such LIBOR Loan shall be continued as a LIBOR Loan having a LIBOR Period of one month. Borrower Representative must make such election by notice to Agent in writing, by telecopy or overnight courier. In the case of any conversion or continuation, such election must be made pursuant to a written notice (a 
Notice of Conversion/Continuation

Exhibit 1.5(e)
. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 1.5(e)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 1.5
, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final order that the rate of interest payable hereunder exceeds the highest rate of interest permissible under law (the 
Maximum Lawful Rate
), then so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be so exceeded, the rate of interest payable hereunder shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate;
provided
, however, that if at any time thereafter the rate of interest payable hereunder is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, Borrowers shall continue to pay interest hereunder at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received by Agent, on behalf of Lenders, is equal to the total interest that would have been received had the interest rate payable hereunder been (but for the operation of this paragraph) the interest rate payable since the Restatement Effective Date as otherwise provided in this Agreement. In no event shall the total interest received by any Lender pursuant to the terms hereof exceed the amount that such Lender could lawfully have received had the interest due hereunder been calculated for the full term hereof at the Maximum Lawful Rate.

).
20

Borrowers shall pay to GE Capital an annual collateral monitoring fee equal to $100,000 per year payable on the Restatement Effective Date and annually in advance on each anniversary thereof prior to the Termination Date;
provided
that, a pro rated portion of the annual collateral monitoring fee paid by the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement on the most recent anniversary of the Closing Date for the period from such anniversary through the Restatement Effective Date will be credited to the Borrowers and only the balance of such annual collateral monitoring fee will be due and payable on the Restatement Effective Date.
(b)
    
As additional compensation for the Lenders, Borrowers shall pay to Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, in arrears, on the first Business Day of each month prior to the Commitment Termination Date and on the Commitment Termination Date, a Fee for Borrowers non use of available funds in an amount in Dollars equal to the Applicable Unused Line Fee Margin per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for actual days elapsed) multiplied by the difference between (x) the Maximum Amount (as it may be increased or reduced from time to time) and (y) the average for the period of the daily closing balances of the aggregate Revolving Loan and the Swing Line Loan outstanding during the period for which such Fee is due.
(c)

Annex B
.
Borrowers shall make each payment under this Agreement not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the day when due in immediately available funds in Dollars, Sterling or Hong Kong Dollars, as applicable, to the applicable Collection Account. For purposes of computing interest and Fees and determining Borrowing Availability as of any date, all payments shall be deemed received on the Business Day on which immediately available funds therefore are received in the Collection Account prior to 2:00 p.m. New York time. Payments received after 2:00 p.m. New York time on any Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day.

Section 1.3(a)
; and (iii) mandatory prepayments shall be applied as set forth in
Section 1.3(d) or 1.3(e)
, as applicable. All payments and prepayments applied to the Revolving Loan shall be applied ratably to the portion thereof held by each Lender as determined by its Pro Rata Share. As to (x) any other payment, (y) all payments made when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or following the Commitment Termination Date and (z) all proceeds of Collateral, each Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any and all such
21

(b)
    
Agent is authorized to, and at its sole election may, charge to the Revolving Loan balance on behalf of each Borrower and cause to be paid all Fees, expenses, Charges, costs (including insurance premiums in accordance with
Section 5.4(a)
) and interest and principal, other than principal of the Revolving Loan, owing by Borrowers under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents if and to the extent Borrowers fail to pay promptly any such amounts as and when due, even if the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such charges would exceed the applicable Borrowing Availability at such time;
provided
, such action shall not cause the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate Revolving Loan to exceed the Maximum Amount. At Agents option and to the extent permitted by law, any charges so made shall constitute a Revolving Credit Advance made in the applicable currency and part of the Revolving Loan hereunder.
(c)
    
Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, if, at the time of the receipt of any prepayment or payment on the Obligations, (i) any Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall have failed to make available to the Fronting Lender any amount required pursuant to
Section 9.9(e)(i)
upon demand therefor by the Fronting Lender and (ii) the Borrowers shall have failed to repay, pursuant to
Section 9.9(e)(iv)
, the outstanding principal amount of the portion of the Revolving Loan or Letter of Credit Obligation then outstanding to the Fronting Lender in which such Non-Foreign Currency Lender was required to purchase a participation interest, then such prepayment or payment shall be applied first to the portion of the Revolving Loan or Letter of Credit Obligations then outstanding to the Fronting Lender in which such Non-Foreign Currency Lender was required to purchase such participation interest, until the same (together with any interest due and payable thereon) shall have been paid in full.
Agent shall maintain a loan account (the 
Loan Account
) on its books to record: all Revolving Credit Advances and Swing Line Advances, all payments made by Borrowers, and all other debits and credits as provided in this Agreement with respect to the Loans or any other Obligations. All entries in the Loan Account shall be made in accordance with Agents customary accounting practices as in effect from time to time. The balance in the Loan Account, as recorded on Agents most recent printout or other written statement, shall, absent manifest error, be presumptive evidence of the amounts due and owing to Agent and Lenders by each
22
Borrower;
provided
that any failure to so record or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect any Borrowers duty to pay the Obligations. Agent shall render to Borrower Representative a monthly accounting of transactions with respect to the Loans setting forth the balance of the Loan Account as to each Borrower for the immediately preceding month. Unless Borrower Representative notifies Agent in writing of any objection to any such accounting (specifically describing the basis for such objection), within thirty (30) days after the date thereof, each and every such accounting shall be presumptive evidence of all matters reflected therein. Only those items expressly objected to in such notice shall be deemed to be disputed by Borrowers. Notwithstanding any provision herein contained to the contrary, any Lender may elect (which election may be revoked) to dispense with the issuance of Notes to that Lender and may rely on the Loan Account as evidence of the amount of Obligations from time to time owing to it.
(a)
    
Each Credit Party shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each of Agent, Lenders, the Fronting Lender and their respective Affiliates, and each such Persons respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents and representatives (each, an 
Indemnified Person
), from and against any and all suits, actions, proceedings, claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements and other costs of investigation or defense, including those incurred upon any appeal) that may be instituted or asserted against or incurred by any such Indemnified Person as the result of credit having been extended, suspended or terminated under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the administration of such credit, and in connection with or arising out of the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder and any actions or failures to act in connection therewith, including any and all Environmental Liabilities and legal costs and expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with disputes between or among any parties to any of the Loan Documents (collectively, 
Indemnified Liabilities
);
provided
, that no such Credit Party shall be liable for any indemnification to an Indemnified Person to the extent that any such suit, action, proceeding, claim, damage, loss, liability or expense results from that Indemnified Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. NO INDEMNIFIED PERSON SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, ANY SUCCESSOR, ASSIGNEE OR THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF SUCH PERSON OR ANY OTHER PERSON ASSERTING CLAIMS DERIVATIVELY THROUGH SUCH PARTY, FOR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE ALLEGED AS A RESULT OF CREDIT HAVING BEEN EXTENDED, SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR AS A RESULT OF ANY OTHER TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER. It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 1.13(a)
, no Foreign Credit Party shall have any obligation to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities relating to Obligations of any Domestic Credit Party.
23
(b)
    
To induce Lenders to provide the LIBOR Loan option on the terms provided herein, if (i) any LIBOR Loans are repaid in whole or in part prior to the last day of any applicable LIBOR Period (whether that repayment is made pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or occurs as a result of acceleration, by operation of law or otherwise); (ii) any Borrower shall default in payment when due of the principal amount of or interest on any LIBOR Loan; (iii) any Borrower shall refuse to accept any borrowing of, or shall request a termination of, any borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of, LIBOR Loans after Borrower Representative has given notice requesting the same in accordance herewith; (iv) any Borrower shall fail to make any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan after Borrower Representative has given a notice thereof in accordance herewith; or (v) any assignment shall occur pursuant to
Section 1.16(d)
, then Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Lender from and against all losses, costs and expenses resulting from or arising from any of the foregoing. Such indemnification shall include any loss (excluding loss of margin) or expense arising from the reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate deposits from which such funds were obtained. For the purpose of calculating amounts payable to a Lender under this subsection, each Lender shall be deemed to have actually funded its portion of the relevant LIBOR Loan (or its participation interest in such LIBOR Loan) through the purchase of a deposit bearing interest at the Dollar LIBOR Rate, the Sterling LIBOR Rate or the Hong Kong Dollars LIBOR Rate, as applicable, in an amount equal to the amount of such portion of such LIBOR Loan (or such participation, as applicable) and having a maturity comparable to the relevant LIBOR Period;
provided
, that each Lender may fund each of its interests in LIBOR Loans (or its participations in LIBOR Loans) in any manner it sees fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this subsection. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder. As promptly as practicable under the circumstances, each Lender shall provide Borrower Representative with its written calculation of all amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 1.13(b)
, and such calculation shall be binding on the parties hereto unless Borrower Representative shall object in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt thereof, specifying the basis for such objection in detail. It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 1.13(b)
, no Foreign Credit Party shall have any obligation to any Lender with regard to any such losses, costs and expenses relating to Obligations of any Domestic Credit Party.
Each Credit Party shall, during normal business hours, from time to time upon three (3) Business Days prior notice as frequently as Agent reasonably determines to be appropriate (except as otherwise provided): (a) provide Agent and any of its officers, employees and agents access to its properties, facilities, advisors, officers and employees and to the Collateral (including, without limitation, in order to prepare an appraisal or similar report), (b) permit Agent, and any of its officers, employees and agents, to inspect, audit and make extracts from any Sotheby Entitys books and records, and (c) permit Agent, and its officers, employees and agents, not more than two (2) times during any twelve-month period beginning on the date hereof or any anniversary thereof (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case such limitation shall not apply), to inspect, review, evaluate, and make test
24
verifications and counts of the Collateral of any Credit Party;
provided
, that (i) Agent shall conduct at least one (1) field exam described in the foregoing
clause (c)
during each twelve-month period and (ii) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, not more than two such field exams during any twelve-month period shall be at the cost and expense of the Credit Parties. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each such Credit Party shall provide such access to Agent and to each Lender at all times and without advance notice. Furthermore, so long as any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Credit Party shall provide Agent and each Lender with access to their suppliers and customers to the extent such access is within the rights and powers of such Credit Party. Each Credit Party shall make available to Agent and its counsel reasonably promptly originals or copies of all books and records that Agent may reasonably request. Each Credit Party shall deliver any document or instrument necessary for Agent, as it may from time to time reasonably request, to obtain records from any service bureau or other Person that maintains records for such Credit Party, and shall maintain duplicate records or supporting documentation on media, including computer tapes and discs owned by such Credit Party. Agent will give Lenders at least five (5) days prior written notice of regularly scheduled audits. Representatives of other Lenders may accompany Agents representatives on regularly scheduled audits at no charge to Borrowers.

Tax gross-up
.
(i)
    
Each Credit Party shall make all payments to be made by it under the Loan Documents without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.
(ii)
    
The Borrower Representative shall promptly upon becoming aware that a Credit Party must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify Agent accordingly. Similarly, a Lender shall notify Agent promptly on becoming so aware in respect of any payment to that Lender pursuant to any Loan Document. If Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall promptly notify the Borrower Representative.
(iii)
    
Subject to
paragraph (iv)
below, if a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by any Credit Party, the amount of the payment due from such Credit Party shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.
(iv)
    
A Credit Party is not required to make an increased payment to a Lender under
paragraph (iii)
above for a Tax Deduction in respect of tax imposed by the United Kingdom, Hong Kong or the United States of America (as the case may be) on a payment under the Loan Documents, if on the date on which the payment falls due:
(A)
    
the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Agreement in (or in the
25
interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or Treaty, or any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing authority;
(B)
    
with respect to any payment to be made by a U.K. Credit Party, (i) the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of
paragraph (i)(B)
of the definition of Qualifying Lender, (ii) an officer of H.M. Revenue & Customs has given (and not revoked) a direction (a 
Direction
) under section 931 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which relates to that payment and that Lender has received from the Credit Party making the payment a certified copy of that Direction, and (iii) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a Tax Deduction in the absence of that Direction;
(C)
    
with respect to any payment to be made by a U.K. Credit Party, the relevant Lender is a Treaty Lender and the Credit Party making the payment is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under
paragraph (vii)
below;
(D)
    
the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of
paragraph (i)(B)
of the definition of Qualifying Lender and:
(E)    with respect to any payments to be made by a Domestic Credit Party, the Tax is (i) assessed on a Lender under (x) the law of the jurisdiction in which that Lender is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which that Lender is treated as resident for tax purposes, (y) the law of the jurisdiction in which that Lenders facility office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction or (z) the law of the jurisdiction with which that Lender and the jurisdiction have a present or former connection (other than such connection arising from any Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, any Loan Document) and (ii) imposed on or measured by net income with respect to that Lender or such Tax is a franchise tax or branch profits tax, or imposed in lieu of a net income Tax; or
26
(F)    the payment is subject to U.S. federal withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA.
(v)
    
If any Credit Party is required to make a Tax Deduction, such Credit Party shall make such Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with such Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.
(vi)
    
Within thirty days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with a Tax Deduction, the Credit Party making such Tax Deduction shall deliver to Agent for the applicable Lender either a statement under section 975 of the Income Tax Act 2007 or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to such Lender that such Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority.
(vii)
    
A Treaty Lender and a U.K. Credit Party which makes a payment to which such Treaty Lender is entitled shall cooperate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for such U.K. Credit Party to obtain authorization to make such payment without a Tax Deduction. A Treaty Lender which holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme and which desires that such scheme apply to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, shall within ten Business Days of the date it becomes a Lender under this Agreement
or if an existing authorization to make a payment without a Tax Deduction in respect of that Treaty Lender is in place and it is HMRC practice to apply the DT Treaty Passport Scheme in such circumstances, at an appropriate time prior to
the expiry of that authorization (i) indicate to Agent and the Borrower Representative that it wishes the scheme to apply to its Loan under this Agreement and (ii) provide to the Agent and the Borrower Representative its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence.
(viii)
    
A U.K. Non-Bank Lender shall promptly notify Agent who shall notify the U.K. Credit Parties if there is any change in the position from that set out in the Tax Confirmation.

(A)    not a Qualifying Lender;
(B)    a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender); or
(C)    a Treaty Lender.
If a New Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this
paragraph (ix)
, then such New Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each U.K. Credit Party) as if it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies Agent which category applies (and Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Borrower Representative on behalf of
27
the U.K. Credit Parties). For the avoidance of doubt, an Assignment Agreement shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this
paragraph (ix)
.
(x)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the IRC, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrowers and Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrowers or Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the IRC) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrowers or Agent as may be necessary for Borrowers and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (x)

(ii)
    
Paragraph (b)(i)
above shall not apply:
(A)
    
with respect to any Tax (i) assessed on a Lender under (x) the law of the jurisdiction in which that Lender is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which that Lender is treated as resident for tax purposes or (y) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Lenders facility office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction and (ii) imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Lender; and
(B)
    
to the extent a loss, liability or cost (i) is compensated for by an increased payment under
Section 1.15(a)
or
(ii)
would have been compensated for by an increased payment under
Section 1.15(a)
but was not so compensated solely because one of the exclusions in
Section 1.15(a)(iv)
applied.
(iii)
    
A Protected Party making, or intending to make, a claim under
paragraph (i)
above shall promptly notify Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which Agent shall notify the Borrower Representative.
(iv)
    
A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from a Credit Party under this
Section 1.15(b)
, notify Agent.
28
(c)
    
Tax Credit
. If a Credit Party makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Lender determines that:
(i)
    
a Tax Credit is attributable either to an increased payment under
Section 1.15(a)
of which that Tax Payment forms part, or to that Tax Payment; and
(ii)
    
that Lender has obtained, utilized and retained that Tax Credit,
the Lender shall pay an amount to the applicable Credit Party which that Lender determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by such Credit Party.
(d)
    
Stamp Taxes
. The Credit Parties shall pay, and within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Lender against any cost, loss, or liability that a Lender incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of the Loan Documents.

.
(i)
    
All amounts expressed in the Loan Documents to be payable by any Credit Party to a Lender or Agent which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for a supply or supplies for VAT purposes shall be deemed to be exclusive of VAT. If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender or Agent to any Credit Party in connection with any Loan Document, such Credit Party shall pay to such Lender or Agent, as applicable, (in addition to and at the same time as paying the consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT (and such Lender shall promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to the relevant Credit Party).
(ii)
    
Where any Loan Document requires any Credit Party to reimburse or indemnify a Lender or Agent for any cost or expense, such Credit Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Lender or Agent, as applicable, for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, except to the extent that such Lender or Agent, as applicable, reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT.
(iii)
    
Any reference in this
Section 1.15(e)
to any Credit Party shall, at any time when such Credit Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term representative member to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).
(a)
    
If any law, treaty, governmental (or quasi governmental) rule, regulation, guideline or order regarding capital adequacy, reserve requirements or similar requirements or compliance by any Lender (including, as applicable, as L/C Issuer) with any request or directive
29
regarding capital adequacy, reserve requirements or similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law), in each case, adopted after the Restatement Effective Date, from any central bank or other Governmental Authority increases or would have the effect of increasing the amount of capital, reserves or other funds required to be maintained by such Lender and thereby reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder, then Borrowers shall from time to time upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to Agent) pay to Agent, for the account of such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such reduction. A certificate as to the amount of that reduction and showing the basis of the computation thereof submitted by such Lender to Borrower Representative and to Agent shall be presumptive evidence of the matters set forth therein.
(b)
    
If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in any law or regulation (or any change in the interpretation thereof) or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), in each case adopted after the Restatement Effective Date, there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender (including, as applicable, as L/C Issuer) of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Loan or Letter of Credit (or any participation in any Loan or Letter of Credit purchased pursuant to
Section 9.9(e)(i)
), then Borrowers shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to Agent), pay to Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to Borrower Representative and to Agent by such Lender, shall be presumptive evidence of the matters set forth therein. Each Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after it becomes aware of any circumstances referred to above which would result in any such increased cost, the affected Lender shall, to the extent not inconsistent with such Lenders internal policies of general application, use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize costs and expenses incurred by it and payable to it by Borrowers pursuant to this
Section 1.16(b)
. For the avoidance of doubt,
Sections 1.16(a) and 1.16(b)
shall not apply to Taxes which shall be exclusively governed by
Section 1.15
.
(c)
    
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the introduction of or any change in any law or regulation (or any change in the interpretation thereof) shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender to agree to make or to make or to continue to fund or maintain any LIBOR Loan (or a participation interest in any LIBOR Loan), then, unless that Lender is able to make or to continue to fund or to maintain such LIBOR Loan (or participation interest, as applicable) at another branch or office of that Lender without, in that Lenders reasonable opinion, materially adversely affecting it, its Loans or its participation interests in Loans or the income obtained therefrom, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to Borrower Representative through Agent, (x) the obligation of such Lender to agree to make or to make or to continue to fund or maintain LIBOR Loans (or participation interests in LIBOR Loans) shall terminate and (y) each Borrower shall forthwith prepay in full all outstanding LIBOR Loans owing by such Borrower to such Lender (or to the Fronting Lender, to the extent of the participation interests in LIBOR Loans of the Fronting Lender held by such Lender, and the Fronting Lender shall pay such amounts to such Lender in respect of such participation
30
interests), together with interest accrued thereon, unless Borrower Representative on behalf of such Borrower, within five (5) Business Days after the delivery of such notice and demand, converts all LIBOR Loans into Index Rate Loans.
(i)
    
If Agent shall have determined in good faith that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Dollar LIBOR Rate, the Sterling LIBOR Rate or the Hong Kong Dollars LIBOR Rate, as applicable, for any requested LIBOR Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan or that the Dollar LIBOR Rate, the Sterling LIBOR Rate or the Hong Kong Dollars LIBOR Rate, as applicable, applicable pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)
for any requested LIBOR Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, Agent will forthwith give notice of such determination to Borrower Representative and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower Representative may revoke any Notice of Revolving Credit Advance or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If Borrower Representative does not revoke such notice, Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by Borrower Representative, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by Borrower Representative, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Index Rate Loans.
(d)
    
Within thirty (30) days after receipt by Borrower Representative of written notice and demand from any Lender (an 
Affected Lender
) for payment of additional amounts or increased costs as provided in
Sections 1.15(a)
,
1.16(a)
or
1.16(b)
, Borrower Representative may, at its option, notify Agent and such Affected Lender of its intention to replace the Affected Lender. Borrower Representative may obtain, at Borrowers expense, a replacement Lender (
Replacement Lender
) for the Affected Lender, so long as (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) Agent has consented to such replacement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed if such Replacement Lender constitutes a Qualified Assignee). If Borrowers obtain a Replacement Lender within ninety (90) days following notice of their intention to do so, the Affected Lender must sell and assign its outstanding Loans, Letter of Credit Obligations and Commitments to such Replacement Lender for an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of all Loans held by the Affected Lender and all accrued interest and Fees with respect thereto through the date of such sale and such assignment shall not require the payment of an assignment fee to Agent;
provided
, that Borrowers shall have reimbursed such Affected Lender for the additional amounts or increased costs that it is entitled to receive under this Agreement through the date of such sale and assignment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrowers shall not have the right to obtain a Replacement Lender if the Affected Lender rescinds its demand for increased costs or additional amounts within 15 days following its receipt of Borrowers notice of intention to replace such Affected Lender. Furthermore, if Borrowers give a notice of intention to replace and do not so replace such Affected Lender within ninety (90) days thereafter, Borrowers rights under this
Section 1.16(d)
shall terminate with respect to such Affected Lender and Borrowers shall promptly pay all increased costs or additional amounts demanded by such Affected Lender pursuant to
Sections 1.15(a), 1.16(a) and 1.16(b)
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Lender that is a Non-Funding Lender or an Impacted Lender, Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, obtain a Replacement Lender and
31
execute an Assignment Agreement on behalf of such Non-Funding Lender or Impacted Lender at any time with three (3) Business Days prior notice to such Lender (unless notice is not practicable under the circumstances) and cause such Lenders Loans, participations and Commitments to be sold and assigned, in whole or in part, at par.
(e)
    
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States of America or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case in respect of this
clause (ii)
, pursuant to Basel III, shall, in each case, be deemed to be a change in regulation regarding capital adequacy under
Section 1.16(a)
and/or a change in law under
Section 1.16(b)
, as applicable, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
All Loans to each Domestic Borrower and all of the other Obligations of the each Domestic Borrower arising under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall constitute one general obligation of the Domestic Borrowers secured, until the Termination Date, by all of the Collateral covered under the Domestic Collateral Documents. All Loans to each Foreign Borrower and all of the other Obligations of each Foreign Borrower arising under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall constitute one general obligation of both the Domestic Borrowers and the Foreign Borrowers secured, until the Foreign Obligations Termination Date, by all of the Collateral covered under the Collateral Documents.
(a)
    
Except as expressly set forth herein, all valuations or computations of monetary amounts set forth in this Agreement shall include the Dollar Equivalent of Sterling, Hong Kong Dollars or any other applicable currency. All currency conversions to be made under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the following procedure:
(ii)
    
Conversions to Dollars shall occur in accordance with prevailing exchange rates, as determined by Agent or the Fronting Lender, as applicable, in its reasonable discretion, on the applicable date.
(iii)
    
Conversions to any Foreign Currency shall occur in accordance with prevailing exchange rates, as determined by Agent or the Fronting Lender, as applicable, in its reasonable discretion, on the applicable date.
(iv)
    
The Dollar Equivalent of each of the Revolving Credit Advances, Swing Line Advances and Letter of Credit Obligations denominated in currencies other than Dollars shall be re-calculated on (a) so long as the Aggregate Borrowing Availability equals or exceeds $5,000,000, the first Business Day of each month and (b) otherwise, the first Business Day of each week.
32
(b)
    
All valuations or computations of monetary amounts set forth in any Borrowing Base Certificate, any Art Inventory Report, any Art Loan Receivables Report or any other report, certificate, Financial Statement or other document delivered by any Credit Party to Agent hereunder shall be made in accordance with GAAP and the ordinary business practices of the Credit Parties as of the Restatement Effective Date;
provided
, that any such report or document shall set forth the conversion factors used with respect to any foreign currencies.
(a)
    
If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Credit Party in any court in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into any other currency (such other currency being hereinafter in this
Section 1.19
referred to as the 
Judgment Currency
) an amount due under any Loan Document in any currency (the 
Obligation Currency
) other than the Judgment Currency, the conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day immediately preceding (i) the date of actual payment of the amount due, in the case of any proceeding in the courts of any jurisdiction that will give effect to such conversion being made on such date, or (ii) the date on which the judgment is given, in the case of any proceeding in the courts of any other jurisdiction (the applicable date as of which such conversion is made pursuant to this
Section 1.19
being hereinafter referred to as the 
Judgment Conversion Date
).
(b)
    
If, in the case of any proceeding in the court of any jurisdiction referred to in
Section 1.19(a)
, there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Conversion Date and the date of actual receipt for value of the amount due, the applicable Credit Party shall pay such additional amount (if any, but in any event not a lesser amount) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount actually received in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount of the Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial order at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Conversion Date. Any amount due from a Credit Party under this
Section 1.19(b)
shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other amounts due under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents.
(c)
    
The term rate of exchange in this
Section 1.19
means the rate of exchange at which Agent would, on the relevant date at or about noon (New York City time), be able to sell the Obligation Currency against the Judgment Currency to prime banks.
(d)
    
Any amount received or recovered by Agent in respect of any sum expressed to be due to them (whether for itself or on behalf of any other person) from any Credit Party under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents in a currency other than the currency (the contractual currency) in which such sum is so expressed to be due (whether as a result of, or from the enforcement of, any judgment or order of a court or tribunal of any jurisdiction, the winding-up of a Borrower or otherwise) shall only constitute a discharge of such Borrower to the extent of the amount of the contractual currency that Agent is able, in accordance with its usual practice, to purchase with the amount of the currency so received or recovered on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if later, the first date on which such purchase is
33
practicable). If the amount of the contractual currency so purchased is less than the amount of the contractual currency so expressed to be due, such Borrower shall indemnify Agent against any loss sustained by it as a result, including the cost of making any such purchase other than losses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person seeking such indemnification.
Dollars are the currency of account and payment for each and every sum at any time due from the Borrowers hereunder;
provided
, that:
(i)
    
unless expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, each repayment of a Revolving Credit Advance or a part thereof advanced in any Foreign Currency shall be made in such Foreign Currency;
(ii)
    
each payment of interest in respect of principal, or any other sum, denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be made in such Foreign Currency;
(iii)
    
each payment in respect of costs and expenses incurred in any Foreign Currency shall be made in such Foreign Currency; and
(iv)
    
any other amount expressed to be payable in any Foreign Currency shall be paid in such Foreign Currency.

ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATIONS; APPOINTMENT OF AGENT
(h)
    
Subject to the terms of this
Section 9.1
, any Lender may make an assignment to an assignee of, or sell participations in, at any time or times, the Loan Documents, the Loans, the Letter of Credit Obligations and any Commitment or any portion thereof or interest therein, including any Lenders rights, title, interests, remedies, powers or duties thereunder. Any assignment by a Lender shall: (i) require the consent of Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed with respect to a Qualified Assignee) and the execution of an assignment agreement (an 
Assignment Agreement
) substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 9.1(a)
and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to, and acknowledged by, Agent; (ii) after giving effect to any such partial assignment, the assignee Lender shall have Commitments in an amount at least equal to $5,000,000 and the assigning Lender shall have retained Commitments in an amount at least equal to $5,000,000; (iii) include a payment to Agent of an assignment fee of $3,500; and (iv) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, require the consent of Borrower Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided
that no such consent shall be required for an assignment to a Qualified Assignee. Agents refusal to consent to an assignment by a Non-Funding Lender who is a Non-Funding Lender due to
clause (a)
of the definition of Non-Funding
69
Lender (unless in connection with such assignment, such Non-Funding Lender cures, or causes the cure of, its Non-Funding Lender status as contemplated in
Section 9.9(d)(v)
) shall not be deemed to be unreasonable. Agents refusal to consent to an assignment by any Lender to any Person that would be a Non-Funding Lender or an Impacted Lender, or the imposition of conditions or limitations (including limitations on voting) upon assignments to such Persons, shall not be deemed to be unreasonable. In the case of an assignment by a Lender under this
Section 9.1
, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment, the same rights, benefits and obligations as all other Lenders hereunder. The assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its Commitments or assigned portion thereof from and after the date of such assignment. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that any assignment shall give rise to a direct obligation of Borrowers to the assignee and that the assignee shall be considered to be a Lender. In all instances, each Lenders liability to make Loans or purchase participation interests therein hereunder shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the applicable Commitment. In the event Agent or any Lender assigns or otherwise transfers all or any part of its interest in the Obligations, Agent or any such Lender shall so notify Borrowers and Borrowers shall, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, execute new Notes in exchange for the Notes, if any, being assigned. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 9.1(a)
, any Lender may at any time pledge its interest in the Obligations and such Lenders rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank, and any Lender that is an investment fund may assign its interest in the Obligations and such Lenders rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to another investment fund managed by the same investment advisor;
provided
, that no such pledge to a Federal Reserve Bank shall release such Lender from such Lenders obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.
(i)
    
Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at its address referred to in
Annex I
a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and Borrowers, Agent and Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(j)
    
Any participation by a Lender of all or any part of its Commitments shall be made with the understanding that all amounts payable by Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if that Lender had not sold such participation, and that the holder of any such participation shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except actions directly affecting (i) any reduction in the principal amount of, or interest rate or Fees payable with respect to, any Loan in which such holder participates, (ii) any extension of the scheduled amortization of the principal amount of any Loan in which such holder participates or the final maturity date thereof, and (iii) any release of Agents Lien on all or substantially all of the Collateral (other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
70
the Collateral Documents or the other Loan Documents). Each of the Borrowers agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 1.13, 1.15
(as it applies in relation to US tax only),
1.16 and 9.8
(subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under
Section 1.15
(it being understood that the documentation required in order to constitute a Qualifying Lender and the documentation required under
Section 1.15
shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section;
provided
that such participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 1.15
, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence no Credit Party shall have any obligation or duty to any participant. Neither Agent nor any Lender (other than the Lender selling a participation) shall have any duty to any participant and may continue to deal solely with the Lender selling a participation as if no such sale had occurred.
(k)
    
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the 
Participant Register
). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Agent shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(l)
    
Except as expressly provided in this
Section 9.1
, no Lender shall, as between Borrowers and that Lender, or Agent and that Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation of, or granting of participation in, all or any part of the Loans, the Notes or other Obligations owed to such Lender.
(m)
    
Each Credit Party shall assist any Lender permitted to sell assignments or participations under this
Section 9.1
as reasonably required to enable the assigning or selling Lender to effect any such assignment or participation, including the execution and delivery of any and all agreements, notes and other documents and instruments as shall be requested and, if requested by Agent, the preparation of informational materials for, and the participation of management in meetings with, potential assignees or participants. Each Credit Party shall certify the correctness, completeness and accuracy of all descriptions of the Sotheby Entities and their respective affairs contained in any selling materials provided by them and all other information provided by them and included in such materials, except that the Projections shall only be certified by Borrowers as having been prepared by Borrowers in compliance with the representations contained in
Section 3.4(b)
.
(n)
    
Any Lender may furnish any information concerning Sotheby Entities in the possession of such Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants);
provided
that such Lender shall obtain from assignees or participants confidentiality covenants substantially equivalent to those contained in
Section 11.8
.
71
(o)
    
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no Lender shall assign or sell participations in any portion of its Loans or Commitment to a potential Lender or participant, if, as of the date of the proposed assignment or sale, the assignee Lender or participant would be subject to capital adequacy or similar requirements under
Section 1.16(a)
, increased costs under
Section 1.16(b)
, an inability to fund LIBOR Loans under
Section 1.16(c)
, or withholding taxes in accordance with
Section 1.15(a)
.
(p)
    
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a 
Granting Lender
), may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an 
SPC
), identified as such in writing by the Granting Lender to Agent and Borrowers, the option to provide to Borrowers all or any part of any Loans that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement;
provided
that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan; and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. No SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). Any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, Borrowers and Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by Borrowers and Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This
Section 9.1(i)
may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any of whose Loans are being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including without limitation, the approval of any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or the obligation to pay any amount otherwise payable by the Granting Lender under the Loan Documents, continue to be the Lender of record hereunder.
(q)
    
In the case of an assignment by a Non-Foreign Currency Lender to a Foreign Currency Lender of any interest in the Revolving Loan Outstandings, such Foreign Currency Lender shall purchase the portion of the Revolving Loan outstanding to the Fronting Lender to the extent of the participation interest therein of such Non-Foreign Currency Lender making such assignment for a purchase price, in the applicable Foreign Currencies, equal to such outstanding amount, and the Fronting Lender shall pay the Dollar Equivalent as of such date of such amount to such Non-Foreign Currency Lender in payment of such participation interest. In the case of an assignment by a Foreign Currency Lender to a Non-Foreign Currency Lender of any interest in the Revolving Loan Outstandings, the Fronting Lender shall purchase the portion of the Revolving Loan outstanding to such Foreign Currency Lender which is subject to such assignment, and such Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall purchase an undivided participation interest in the Revolving Loan Outstandings from the Fronting Lender for a purchase price in Dollars equal to the Dollar Equivalent as of such date of such portion assigned.
72
(r)
    
Any Non-Foreign Currency Lender may become a Foreign Currency Lender hereunder upon delivery of notice to Agent, the Fronting Lender and the Borrower Representative. Upon delivery of such notice by such Lender, without any further action whatsoever (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have purchased from the Fronting Lender a portion of the Revolving Loan Outstandings held by the Fronting Lender equal to such Lenders participation interests therein, (ii) the Fronting Lender shall be deemed to have repaid such participation interests to such Lender and shall have no further obligations to such Lender hereunder, (iii) such Lender shall constitute a Foreign Currency Lender for all purposes hereunder, including, without limitation, the Commitment to make Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances pursuant to
Section 1.1(a)(i)
and
(iv)
the Fronted Percentage, and the obligation of the Fronting Lender to make Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances pursuant to
Section 1.1(a)(i)
, shall be reduced accordingly.
GE Capital is hereby appointed to act on behalf of all Lenders and the Fronting Lender as Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The provisions of this
Section 9.2
are solely for the benefit of Agent, Lenders and the Fronting Lender and no Sotheby Entity nor any other Person shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Agent shall act solely as an agent of Lenders and the Fronting Lender and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for any Sotheby Entity or any other Person. Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except for those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Except as expressly set forth in the Foreign Collateral Documents, the duties of Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature and Agent shall not have, or be deemed to have, by reason of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the Fronting Lender. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for failure to disclose, any information relating to any Sotheby Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Account Debtor that is communicated to or obtained by GE Capital or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Neither Agent nor any of its Affiliates nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives shall be liable to any Lender or the Fronting Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or in connection herewith or therewith, except for damages caused by its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.
If Agent shall request instructions from Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders or all affected Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until Agent shall have received instructions from Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders or all affected Lenders, as the case may be, and Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (a) if such
73
action would, in the opinion of Agent, be contrary to law or the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (b) if such action would, in the opinion of Agent, expose Agent to Environmental Liabilities or (c) if Agent shall not first be indemnified to its satisfaction against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender or the Fronting Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Loan Document in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders or all affected Lenders, as applicable.
Neither Agent nor any of its Affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for damages caused by its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form reasonably satisfactory to Agent; (b) may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents on the part of any Credit Party or to inspect the Collateral (including the books and records) of any Credit Party; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopy, telegram, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.
With respect to its Commitments hereunder, GE Capital shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Agent; and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include GE Capital in its individual capacity. GE Capital and its Affiliates may lend money to, invest in, and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Sotheby Entity, any of their Affiliates and any Person who may do business with or own securities of any Sotheby Entity or any such Affiliate, all as if GE Capital were not Agent and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders. GE Capital and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from any Sotheby Entity for services in connection with this Agreement
74
or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges the potential conflict of interest between GE Capital as a Lender holding disproportionate interests in the Loans and GE Capital as Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender and based on the Financial Statements referred to in
Section 3.4(a)
and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit and financial analysis of the Sotheby Entities and its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. Each Lender acknowledges the potential conflict of interest of each other Lender as a result of Lenders holding disproportionate interests in the Loans, and expressly consents to, and waives any claim based upon, such conflict of interest.
Lenders agree to indemnify Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by Credit Parties and without limiting the obligations of Credit Parties hereunder), ratably according to their respective Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted to be taken by Agent in connection therewith;
provided
, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement and each other Loan Document, to the extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by Credit Parties.
(f)
    
Agent may resign at any time by giving not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Borrower Representative. Upon any such resignation, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Requisite Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the resigning Agents giving notice of resignation, then the resigning Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Lender, if a Lender is willing to accept such appointment, or otherwise shall be a commercial bank or financial institution or a subsidiary of a commercial bank or financial institution if such commercial bank
75
or financial institution is organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $300,000,000. If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing, within thirty (30) days after the date such notice of resignation was given by the resigning Agent, such resignation shall become effective and the Requisite Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Requisite Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above. Any successor Agent appointed by Requisite Lenders hereunder shall be subject to the approval of Borrower Representative, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided
that such approval shall not be required if a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Agent. Upon the earlier of the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent or the effective date of the resigning Agents resignation, the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, except that any indemnity rights or other rights in favor of such resigning Agent shall continue. After any resigning Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this
Section 9
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
(g)
    
The Fronting Lender may resign at any time by giving sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof to Agent, the Non-Foreign Currency Lenders and the Borrowers;
provided
, such resignation shall not become effective until the date upon which a replacement Fronting Lender reasonably acceptable to Agent and Non-Foreign Currency Lenders having aggregate Commitments equal to greater than 50% of the Fronted Percentage and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the Borrowers, has been selected and has assumed the rights and obligations of a Fronting Lender hereunder. If no successor Fronting Lender shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the resigning Fronting Lenders giving of notice of resignation, then the resigning Fronting Lender may, on behalf of the Non-Foreign Currency Lenders, appoint a successor Fronting Lender, which shall be a financial institution having a rating of not less than A or its equivalent by Standard & Poors, and having otherwise the ability to fund the Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances (and the parties hereto agree to use reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Fronting Lender which will not cause an increase in the tax withholding liability for the Borrowers). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Fronting Lender hereunder by a successor Fronting Lender, such successor Fronting Lender shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, duties and obligations of the resigning Fronting Lender, and the resigning Fronting Lender shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any resigning Fronting Lenders resignation, the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Fronting Lender.
In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
76
Event of Default and subject to
Section 9.9(g)
, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without prior notice to any Credit Party or to any Person other than Agent, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to offset and to appropriate and to apply any and all balances held by it at any of its offices for the account of any Credit Party (regardless of whether such balances are then due to such Credit Party) and any other properties or assets at any time held or owing by that Lender or that holder to or for the credit or for the account of any Credit Party against and on account of any of the Obligations that are not paid when due;
provided
, that (i) the Lender exercising such offset rights shall give notice thereof to the affected Credit Party promptly after exercising such rights, and (ii) any balances, properties or assets of a Foreign Credit Party shall be offset, appropriated or applied only to or against the Obligations of the Foreign Credit Parties. Any Lender exercising a right of setoff or otherwise receiving any payment on account of the Obligations in excess of its Pro Rata Share thereof shall purchase for cash (and the other Lenders or holders shall sell) such participations in each such other Lenders or holders Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause such Lender to share the amount so offset or otherwise received with each other Lender or holder in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (other than offset rights exercised by any Lender with respect to
Sections 1.13, 1.15 or 1.16
). Each Lenders obligation under this
Section 9.8
shall be in addition to and not in limitation of its obligations to purchase a participation in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Swing Line Loan under
Section 1.1
. Each Credit Party agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (a) any Lender may exercise its right to offset with respect to amounts in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the Obligations and may sell participations in such amounts so offset to other Lenders and holders and (b) any Lender so purchasing a participation in the Loans made or other Obligations held by other Lenders or holders may exercise all rights of offset, bankers lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender or holder were a direct holder of the Loans and the other Obligations in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all or any portion of the offset amount or payment otherwise received is thereafter recovered from the Lender that has exercised the right of offset, the purchase of participations by that Lender shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored without interest. If a Non-Funding Lender receives any payment described in the second sentence of this
Section 9.8
, such Lender shall turn over such payments to Agent in an amount that would satisfy the cash collateral requirements set forth in
Section 9.9(d)
.

Annex H
not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the requested funding date, in the case of an Index Rate Loan, and not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the requested funding date, in the case of a LIBOR Loan. After receipt of such wire transfers (or, in Agents sole discretion, before receipt of such wire transfers), subject to the terms hereof, Agent shall make the requested Revolving Credit Advance to Borrower. All payments by each Lender pursuant to this
Section 9.9(a)
shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
(vi)
    
On each Business Day (each, a 
Settlement Date
), Agent shall advise each Lender and the Fronting Lender by telephone or telecopy of the amount to be disbursed to such Person in accordance with this

Section 1.10

Availability of Lenders Pro Rata Share
. Agent may assume that each Lender and the Fronting Lender will make its Pro Rata Share or the Fronted Percentage, as applicable, of each Revolving Credit Advance available to Agent on each funding date. If such Pro Rata Share or the Fronted Percentage, as applicable, is not, in fact, paid to Agent by such Lender when due, Agent will be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender or the Fronting Lender, as applicable, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. If any Lender or the Fronting Lender fails to pay the amount of its Pro Rata Share or the Fronted Percentage forthwith upon Agents demand, Agent shall promptly notify Borrower Representative and Borrowers shall immediately repay such amount to Agent. Nothing in this
Section 9.9(b)
or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to require Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Lender or the Fronting Lender or to relieve any Lender or the Fronting Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments or obligations hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrowers may have against any Lender or the Fronting Lender as a result of any default by such Lender or the Fronting Lender hereunder. To the extent that Agent advances funds to any Borrower on behalf of any Lender or the Fronting Lender and is not reimbursed therefor on the same Business Day as such Advance is made, Agent shall be entitled to retain for its account all interest accrued on such Advance until reimbursed by the applicable Lender or the Fronting Lender, as applicable.
(i)
    
Return of Payments
.
(i)
    
If Agent pays an amount to a Lender or the Fronting Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Agent from Borrowers and such related payment is not received by Agent, then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender or the Fronting Lender, as applicable, on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
(ii)
    
If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Agent under this Agreement must be returned to any Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender or the Fronting Lender. In addition, each Lender and the Fronting Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender or the Fronting Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to any Borrower or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
(iii)
    
If the Fronting Lender pays an amount to a Non-Foreign Currency Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by the Fronting Lender from Agent and such related payment is not received by the
79
Fronting Lender, then the Fronting Lender will be entitled to recover such amount from such Non-Foreign Currency Lender on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
(iv)
    
If the Fronting Lender determines at any time that any amount received by the Fronting Lender under this Agreement must be returned to any Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise (or paid to Agent pursuant to
paragraph (ii)
above), then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Fronting Lender will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Non-Foreign Currency Lender. In addition, each Non-Foreign Currency Lender will repay to the Fronting Lender on demand any portion of such amount that the Fronting Lender has distributed to such Non-Foreign Currency Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as the Fronting Lender is required to pay to any Borrower, any such other Person or Agent, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.

(i)
    
Responsibility
. The failure of any Non-Funding Lender to make any Revolving Credit Advance, Letter of Credit Obligation or any payment required by it, or to make any payment required by it hereunder, or to fund any purchase of any participation to be made or funded by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Lender (each such other Lender, an 
Other Lender
) of its obligations to make such loan, fund the purchase of any such participation, or make any other payment required hereunder on such date, and neither Agent nor, other than as expressly set forth herein, any other Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any Non-Funding Lender to make a loan, fund the purchase of a participation or make any other payment required hereunder.
(ii)
    
Reallocation
. If any Lender is a Non-Funding Lender, all or a portion of such Non-Funding Lenders Letter of Credit Obligations (unless such Lender is the L/C Issuer that issued such Letter of Credit), reimbursement obligations with respect to Swing Loans and, as applicable, participation funding obligations under
Section 9.9(e)(i)
shall, at Agents election at any time or upon any L/C Issuers, the Swing Line Lenders or the Fronting Lenders written request delivered to Agent (whether before or after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default), be reallocated to and assumed or funded by the Lenders that are not Non-Funding Lenders or Impacted Lenders pro rata in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Commitments of all Lenders (calculated as if the Non-Funding Lenders Pro Rata Share was reduced to zero and each other Lenders Pro Rata Share had been increased proportionately);
provided
, that no Lender shall be reallocated any such amounts or be required to fund any amounts that would cause the sum of its outstanding Revolving Credit Advances, outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations, amounts of its participations in Swing Line Advances, its pro rata share of unparticipated amounts in Swing Line Advances and amounts of its participations pursuant to
Section 9.9(e)(i)
to exceed its Commitment. Upon any such reallocation of a participation funding obligation under
Section 9.9(e)(i)
to a Foreign Currency Lender, such Foreign Currency Lender shall pay the outstanding principal balance thereof to the Fronting Lender, and any such amounts paid by any Foreign Currency Lender to the Fronting Lender shall be deemed to constitute a Revolving Credit Advance or the purchase of an
80
undivided interest in a Swing Line Advance, as applicable, and, to the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing, the Fronting Lender shall be deemed to have sold, and such Foreign Currency Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, Revolving Credit Advances and participations in Swing Line Advances from the Fronting Lender. At any time any Lender is a Non-Funding Lender, at Agents election at any time or upon any L/C Issuers, the Swing Line Lenders or the Fronting Lenders written request delivered to Agent (whether before or after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default), participating interests in any newly made Swing Line Loan or Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advance or any newly issued or modified Letter of Credit will be allocated among Non-Funding Lenders in a manner consistent with this
Section 9.9(d)(ii)
.
(iii)
    
Voting Rights
. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, including
Section 9.1
, a Non-Funding Lender shall not have any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document or constitute a Lender (or be, or have its Loans, participations and Commitments, included in the determination of Requisite Lenders, or Lenders directly affected pursuant to
Section 11.2
) for any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document; provided, that (A) the Commitment of a Non-Funding Lender may not be increased, (B) the principal of a Non-Funding Lenders Loans may not be reduced and (C) the interest rate applicable to Obligations owing to a Non-Funding Lender may not be reduced in such a manner that by its terms affects such Non-Funding Lender more adversely than other Lenders, in each case without the consent of such Non-Funding Lender. Moreover, for the purposes of determining Requisite Lenders, the Loans, participations and Commitments held by Non-Funding Lenders shall be excluded from the total Loans, participations and Commitments outstanding.
(iv)
    
Borrower Payments to a Non-Funding Lender
. Agent shall be authorized to use all payments received by Agent for the benefit of any Non-Funding Lender pursuant to this Agreement to pay in full the Aggregate Excess Funding Amount to the appropriate Secured Parties. Following such payment in full of the Aggregate Excess Funding Amount, Agent shall be entitled to hold such funds as cash collateral in a non-interest bearing account up to an amount equal to such Non-Funding Lenders unfunded Commitment and to use such amount to pay such Non-Funding Lenders funding obligations hereunder until the Obligations are paid in full in cash, all Letter of Credit Obligations have been discharged or cash collateralized and all Commitments have been terminated. Upon any such unfunded obligations owing by a Non-Funding Lender becoming due and payable, Agent shall be authorized to use such cash collateral to make such payment on behalf of such Non-Funding Lender. With respect to such Non-Funding Lenders failure to fund Revolving Credit Advances, purchase participations in Letters of Credit or Letter of Credit Obligations or fund participations pursuant to
Section 9.9(e)(i)
, any amounts applied by Agent to satisfy such funding shortfalls shall be deemed to constitute a Revolving Credit Advance or amount of the participation required to be funded and, if necessary to effectuate the foregoing, the other Lenders shall be deemed to have sold, and such Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, Revolving Credit Advances or participation interests from the other Lenders until such time as the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Advances, participations in Letters of Credit and Letter of Credit Obligations and participations under
Section 9.9(e)(i)
are held by the Lenders in accordance with
81
their Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders. Any amounts owing by a Non-Funding Lender to Agent which are not paid when due shall accrue interest at the interest rate applicable during such period to Index Rate Loans. In the event that Agent is holding cash collateral of a Non-Funding Lender that cures pursuant to
clause (v)
below or ceases to be a Non-Funding Lender pursuant to the definition of Non-Funding Lender, Agent shall return the unused portion of such cash collateral to such Lender. The 
Aggregate Excess Funding Amount
 of a Non-Funding Lender shall be the aggregate amount of (A) all unpaid obligations owing by such Lender to Agent, L/C Issuers, Swing Line Lender, Fronting Lender and other Lenders under the Loan Documents, including such Lenders pro rata share of all Revolving Loans, Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Line Loans and such Lenders participations pursuant to
Section 9.9(e)(i)
, plus, without duplication, (B) all amounts of such Non-Funding Lenders Commitment reallocated to other Lenders pursuant to
Section 9.9(d)(ii)
.
(v)
    
Cure
. A Lender may cure its status as a Non-Funding Lender under clause (a) of the definition of Non-Funding Lender if such Lender (A) fully pays to Agent, on behalf of the applicable Secured Parties, the Aggregate Excess Funding Amount, plus all interest due thereon and (B) timely funds the next Revolving Credit Advance required to be funded by such Lender or makes the next reimbursement required to be made by such Lender. Any such cure shall not relieve any Lender from liability for breaching its contractual obligations hereunder.
(vi)
    
Fees
. A Lender that is a Non-Funding Lender pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of Non-Funding Lender shall not earn and shall not be entitled to receive, and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay, such Lenders portion of the Fee set forth in
Section 1.9(b)
during the time such Lender is a Non-Funding Lender pursuant to clause (a) thereof. In the event that any reallocation of Letter of Credit Obligations occurs pursuant to
Section 9.9(d)(ii)
, during the period of time that such reallocation remains in effect, the Letter of Credit Fee payable with respect to such reallocated portion shall be payable to (A) all Lenders based on their pro rata share of such reallocation or (B) to the L/C Issuer for any remaining portion not reallocated to any other Lenders. A Non-Foreign Currency Lender that is a Non-Funding Lender pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of Non-Funding Lender shall not earn and shall not be entitled to receive, and the Fronting Lender shall not be required to pay, such Lenders portion of the Applicable Margin set forth in
clause (a)
of the first sentence of
Section 9.9(e)(iii)
during the time such Non-Foreign Currency Lender is a Non-Funding Lender pursuant
to clause (a)
thereof (and such portion of the Applicable Margin shall be retained by the Fronting Lender).

Non-Foreign Currency Lenders
.
(i)
    
Participation Interests
. On any date upon which the Fronting Lender shall be required to (i) make available the Fronted Percentage of any Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advance pursuant to
Section 1.1(a)

Section 1.1(b)(iv)
or pursuant to
paragraph (b)(ii)
of
Annex B
or (ii) purchase a participation interest in a Swing Line Advance denominated in a Foreign Currency pursuant to
Section 1.1(b)(v)
, each Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall on such date be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased from the Fronting
82
Lender an undivided participation interest in such Advance in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such Advance. The purchase price of any such participation interest shall be an amount, in Dollars, equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Pro Rata Share as of the date payment by such Non-Foreign Currency Lenders of such purchase price is required hereunder;
provided
,
however
, that such purchase price need not be funded by any Non-Foreign Currency Lender unless and until the Fronting Lender, in its discretion, shall have made a demand therefor in writing to Agent (which Agent shall promptly forward to each Non-Foreign Currency Lender) with respect to each such participation interest following the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or a good faith determination by the Fronting Lender that the portion of the interest it receives and retains on such Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances and Swing Line Loans does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Fronting Lender of funding such amounts. Payment of such purchase price in respect of any such participation interest shall be made by each Non-Foreign Currency Lender in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Fronting Lenders account as set forth in
Annex H
not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day immediately following the date such demand is delivered to Agent with respect to then outstanding Advances and on each applicable purchase date thereafter with respect to any subsequent Advances, in the case of Advances made as Index Rate Loans, and not later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day immediately following the date such demand is delivered to Agent with respect to then outstanding Advances and on each applicable purchase date thereafter with respect to any subsequent Advances, in the case of Advances made as LIBOR Loans. On any date upon which the Fronting Lender shall be required to purchase an undivided interest and participation in any Letter of Credit Obligation in respect of a Letter of Credit issued for the benefit of a Foreign Borrower pursuant to
paragraph (b)(v)
of
Annex B
, immediately and without further action whatsoever, each Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased from the Fronting Lender an undivided interest and participation in such participation interest. Each Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall fund its participation in all payments made under such Letters of Credit in the same manner as provided in the first sentence of this
Section 9.9(e)(i)
with respect to Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances, each of which Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances shall be in an amount equal to the Sterling Equivalent (if the applicable Letter of Credit was issued for the benefit of a U.K. Borrower) or Hong Kong Dollar Equivalent (if the applicable Letter of Credit was issued for the benefit of Sothebys H.K.) of such payment as of the date thereof.
(ii)
    
Obligation of Non-Foreign Currency Lenders
. Each Non-Foreign Currency Lenders obligation to purchase participation interests (and to fund the purchase price thereof) in accordance with
Section 9.9(e)(i)
shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Non-Foreign Currency Lender may have against the Fronting Lender, Agent, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of any Default or Event of Default; (C) any inability of any Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to borrowing set forth in this Agreement at any time or (D) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
(iii)
    
Payments to Non-Foreign Currency Lenders
. On each Settlement Date (or, if the Fronting Lender shall not be acting as Agent, on the Business Day following each
83
Settlement Date), the Fronting Lender shall advise each Non-Foreign Currency Lender by telephone or telecopy of the amount to be disbursed to such Person in accordance with this
Section 9.9(e)(iii)
. Except as set forth in
Section 9.9(d)
, (a) prior to the funding of the purchase price of the participation interests of the Non-Foreign Currency Lenders in Advances made by the Fronting Lender in accordance with
Section 9.9(e)(i)
, the Fronting Lender shall pay to each Non-Foreign Currency Lender the Dollar Equivalent (calculated as of the date of such payment by the Fronting Lender) of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Applicable Margin paid by the Borrowers on the second Business Day preceding such Settlement Date for the benefit of the Lenders and the Fronting Lender with respect to interest on the portion of the Revolving Loan Outstandings denominated in a Foreign Currency (to the extent such amounts have actually been received by the Fronting Lender) less a portion of such Applicable Margin equal to one-half of one percent (0.50%) per annum (or such other amount as the Fronting Lender and such Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall agree) of such Non-Foreign Currency Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan Outstandings denominated in a Foreign Currency, the latter amount being retained by the Fronting Lender for its own account in compensation for the Fronting Lenders willingness to bear the foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk with respect to such Revolving Loan Outstandings and (b) at all times after the funding of the purchase price of the participation interests of the Non-Foreign Currency Lenders in Advances made by the Fronting Lender in accordance with
Section 9.9(e)(i)
, the Fronting Lender shall pay to each Non-Foreign Currency Lender the Dollar Equivalent (calculated as of the date of such payment by the Fronting Lender) of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of interest and principal paid by the Borrowers on the second Business Day preceding such Settlement Date for the benefit of the Lenders and the Fronting Lender with respect to the portion of the Revolving Loan Outstandings denominated in a Foreign Currency (to the extent such amounts have actually been received by the Fronting Lender). Such payments shall be made by wire transfer to such Non-Foreign Currency Lenders account (as specified by such Lender in
Annex H
or the applicable Assignment Agreement) not later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on each applicable Settlement Date (or, if the Fronting Lender shall not be acting as Agent, on the Business day following each Settlement Date).
(iv)
    
Availability of Non-Foreign Currency Lenders Pro Rata Share
. The Fronting Lender may assume that each Non-Foreign Currency Lender will make its Pro Rata Share of each Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advance available to the Fronting Lender on each date on which such Non-Foreign Currency Lender is required to pay the purchase price of its participation interests therein pursuant to the terms hereof. If any Non-Foreign Currency Lender does not make available to the Fronting Lender any amount required pursuant to
Section 9.9(e)(i)
, the Fronting Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Non-Foreign Currency Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date of non-payment until such amount is paid in full at the Federal Funds Rate for the first two Business Days and at the Dollar Index Rate thereafter. If any Non-Foreign Currency Lender shall fail to make available to the Fronting Lender any amount required pursuant to
Section 9.9(e)(i)
, Borrowers shall immediately repay the outstanding principal amount of the portion of the Revolving Loan or Letter of Credit Obligation then outstanding to the Fronting Lender in which such Non-Foreign Currency Lender was required to purchase a participation interest, upon demand therefor by the Fronting Lender.
84
(v)
    
Non-Funding Lender
. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, if any Non-Foreign Currency Lender is a Non-Funding Lender or Impacted Lender, the Fronting Lender shall not be obligated to fund any Revolving Credit Advance unless (x) the Non-Funding Lender or Impacted Lender has been replaced in accordance with
Section 1.16(d)
, (y) the participation funding obligations of such Non-Funding Lender or Impacted Lender under
Section 9.9(e)(i)
have been cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Fronting Lender, or (z) the Commitments of the other Lenders have been increased by an amount sufficient to satisfy Agent that all future Revolving Credit Advances by the Fronting Lender will be covered by all Non-Foreign Currency Lenders that are not Non-Funding Lenders or Impacted Lenders.
(l)
    
Dissemination of Information
. Agent shall use reasonable efforts to provide Lenders with any notice of Default or Event of Default received by Agent from, or delivered by Agent to, any Credit Party, with notice of any Event of Default of which Agent has actually become aware and with notice of any action taken by Agent following any Event of Default;
provided
, that Agent shall not be liable to any Lender for any failure to do so, except to the extent that such failure is attributable to Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Lenders acknowledge that Borrowers are required to provide Financial Statements and Collateral Reports to Lenders in accordance with
Annexes E and F
hereto and agree that Agent shall have no duty to provide the same to Lenders.
(m)
    
Actions in Concert
. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, each Lender hereby agrees with each other Lender that no Lender shall take any action to protect or enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or the Notes (including exercising any rights of setoff) without first obtaining the prior written consent of Agent and Requisite Lenders, it being the intent of Lenders that any such action to protect or enforce rights under this Agreement and the Notes shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of Agent or Requisite Lenders.
(n)
    
Procedures

Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, each reference in any other Loan Document to the Existing Credit Agreement (including any reference therein to the Credit Agreement, thereunder, thereof, therein or words of like import referring thereto) shall mean and be a reference to this Agreement. Each Credit Party also hereby agrees and acknowledges that each Departing Lenders Commitment under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be terminated and each Departing Lender shall not constitute a Lender hereunder

Each Foreign Borrower hereby agrees that such Foreign Borrower is jointly and severally liable for, and hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Agent and Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, the full and prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of, all Secured Obligations owed or hereafter owing to Agent and Lenders by each other Foreign Borrower; it being understood that the Foreign Borrowers shall have no liability, direct or indirect, for the Secured Obligations of the Domestic Borrowers or the other Domestic Credit Parties hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents. Each Borrower agrees that its guaranty obligation hereunder is a continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, that its obligations under this
Section 12
shall not be discharged until payment and performance, in full, of the Secured Obligations (in the case of any Domestic Borrower) or the Secured Obligations of the Foreign Borrowers (in the case of any Foreign Borrower) has occurred, and that its obligations under this
Section 12
shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and unaffected by,
95
(g)
    
the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability or any future amendment of, or change in, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, document or instrument to which any Borrower is or may become a party;
(h)
    
the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including this

the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect its Lien against, any security for the Secured Obligations or any action, or the absence of any action, by Agent and Lenders in respect thereof (including the release of any such security);

(k)
    
any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor.
Each Domestic Borrower shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as principal debtor with respect to the Secured Obligations guaranteed hereunder. Each Foreign Borrower shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as principal debtor with respect to the Secured Obligations of the other Foreign Borrower guaranteed hereunder.
Each Borrower expressly waives all rights it may have now or in the future under any statute, or at common law, or at law or in equity, or otherwise, to compel Agent or Lenders to marshal assets or to proceed in respect of the Secured Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Borrower against any other Credit Party, any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of such Secured Obligations before proceeding against, or as a condition to proceeding against, such Borrower. It is agreed among each Borrower, Agent and Lenders that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and that, but for the provisions of this
Section 12
and such waivers, Agent and Lenders would decline to enter into this Agreement.
Each Borrower agrees that the provisions of this
Section 12
are for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and their respective successors, transferees, endorsees and assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair, as between any other Borrower and Agent or Lenders, the obligations of such other Borrower under the Loan Documents.

Section 12

Section 12.4
.
Each Credit Party agrees that any and all claims of such Credit Party against any other Borrower or any Guarantor (each an 
Obligor
) with respect to any Intercompany Indebtedness (as hereinafter defined), any endorser, obligor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Secured Obligations, or against any of its properties shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment, in full and in cash, of all Secured Obligations of (i) in the case of the Foreign Credit Parties, such Obligors that are Foreign Credit Parties and (ii) in the case of the Domestic Credit Parties, the Borrowers and the Guarantors, in each case now existing or hereafter arising, including, without limitation, all such Secured Obligations arising after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy Code, regardless of whether or not allowed under such case or proceeding;

No Credit Party shall have any right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, until the Termination Date (in the case of the assets of any Obligor that is a Domestic Credit Party) or the Foreign Obligations Termination Date (in the case of the assets of any Obligor that is a Foreign Credit Party). If all or any part of the assets of any Obligor, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of such Obligor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction or any other action or proceeding, or if the business of any such Obligor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets of any such Obligor are sold, then, and in any such event (such events being herein referred to as an 
Insolvency Event
), any payment or distribution of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which shall be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to any indebtedness of any Obligor to any Credit Party (
Intercompany Indebtedness
) shall be paid or delivered directly to Agent for application to the Secured Obligations in accordance with the Loan Documents (but limited, in the case of any Foreign Credit Party, to the Secured Obligations of the Foreign Borrowers). Should any payment, distribution, security or instrument or proceeds thereof be
97
received by the applicable Credit Party upon or with respect to such Intercompany Indebtedness after any Insolvency Event and prior to the Termination Date (in the case of any Intercompany Indebtedness of a Domestic Credit Party) or the Foreign Obligations Termination Date (in the case of any Intercompany Indebtedness of a Foreign Credit Party), such Credit Party shall receive and hold the same in trust, as trustee, for the benefit of Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith deliver the same to Agent in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement or assignment of such Credit Party where necessary), for application to the Secured Obligations in accordance with the Loan Documents (but limited, in the case of any Foreign Credit Party, to the Secured Obligations of the Foreign Borrowers), and, until so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by such Credit Party as the property of Agent and the Lenders. If any such Credit Party fails to make any such endorsement or assignment to Agent, Agent or any of its officers or employees is irrevocably authorized to make the same. Each Credit Party agrees that until the Termination Date (in the case of any claim against an Obligor that is a Domestic Credit Party) or the Foreign Obligations Termination Date (in the case of any claim against an Obligor that is a Foreign Credit Party), such Credit Party will not assign or transfer to any Person (other than Agent, a Credit Party or another Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents) any claim such Credit Party has or may have against any Obligor. It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 12.5
, no Foreign Credit Party shall have any obligation to Agent or any Lender with respect to any Secured Obligations of any Domestic Credit Party.
If Agent or any Lender may, under applicable law, proceed to realize its benefits under any of the Loan Documents giving Agent or such Lender a Lien upon any Collateral, whether owned by any Borrower or by any other Person, either by judicial foreclosure or by non judicial sale or enforcement, Agent or any Lender may, at its sole option, determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without affecting any of its rights and remedies under this
Section 12
. If, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Agent or any Lender shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any applicable laws pertaining to election of remedies or the like, each Borrower hereby consents to such action by Agent or such Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by Agent or such Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of subrogation that each Borrower might otherwise have had but for such action by Agent or such Lender. Any election of remedies that results in the denial or impairment of the right of Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrowers obligation to pay the full amount of the Secured Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Borrower. In the event Agent or any Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustees sale or at any private sale permitted by law or the Loan Documents, Agent or such Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Secured Obligations and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Agent or such Lender but shall be credited against the Secured Obligations. The amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether Agent, Lender or any other party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Secured Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of
98
the Secured Obligations guaranteed by the applicable Borrowers under this
Section 12
, notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.
The liability of Borrowers under this
Section 12
is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Borrower to Agent and Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party or in respect of any Secured Obligations or obligation of the other Borrowers, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Agent and Lenders agree to incur, from time to time prior to the Commitment Termination Date, upon the request of Borrower Representative on behalf of the applicable Borrower (and any Subsidiary that may be a co-applicant therewith) and for such Borrowers (and such Subsidiarys, as applicable) account, Letter of Credit Obligations by causing Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars, Sterling, Euros, Swiss Francs, Hong Kong Dollars or any Alternative L/C Currency to be issued by GE Capital or a Subsidiary thereof or a bank or other legally authorized Person selected by or acceptable to Agent in its sole discretion (each, an 
L/C Issuer
) for such Domestic Borrowers account and guaranteed by Agent;
provided
, that if the L/C Issuer is a Lender, then such Letters of Credit shall not be guaranteed by Agent but rather each Lender shall, subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, purchase (or be deemed to have purchased) risk participations in all such Letters of Credit issued with the written consent of Agent, as more fully described in
paragraph (b)(ii)
below. The Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate amount of all such Letter of Credit Obligations shall not at any time exceed the lesser of (i) an amount equal to Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the

Section 2
, such payment shall then be deemed automatically to constitute a Revolving Credit Advance to the applicable Domestic Borrower under

(iv)    If it shall be illegal or unlawful for any Domestic Borrower to incur Revolving Credit Advances as contemplated by

above because of an Event of Default described in
Sections 8.1(g) or (h)
or otherwise or if it shall be illegal or unlawful for any Lender to be deemed to have assumed a ratable share of the reimbursement obligations owed to an L/C Issuer, or if the L/C Issuer is a Lender, then (A) immediately and without further action whatsoever, each Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased from Agent (or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be) an undivided interest and participation equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share (based on the Commitments) of the Letter of Credit Obligations in respect of all Letters of Credit then outstanding for the benefit of the Domestic Borrowers and (B) thereafter, immediately upon issuance of any Letter of Credit for the benefit of a Domestic Borrower, each Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased from Agent (or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be) an undivided interest and participation equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share (based on the Commitments) of the Letter of Credit Obligations with respect to such Letter of Credit on the date of such issuance.

Each Foreign Currency Lender and the Fronting Lender shall fund its participation in all payments made under any Letters of Credit issued for the benefit of a Foreign Borrower, in the same manner as provided in the Agreement with respect to Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances, each of which Foreign Currency Revolving Credit Advances shall be in an amount equal to the Sterling Equivalent (if such Foreign Borrower is a U.K. Borrower) or Hong Kong Dollar Equivalent (if such Foreign Borrower is Sothebys H.K.) of such payment as of the date thereof.

        Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any accounting term used in the Agreement shall have the meaning customarily given such term in accordance with GAAP, and all financial computations hereunder shall be computed in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. That certain items or computations are explicitly modified by the phrase in accordance with GAAP shall in no way be construed to limit the foregoing. If any Accounting Changes (as defined below) occur and such changes result in a change in the calculation of the financial covenants, standards or terms used in the Agreement or any other Loan Document, then Borrowers, Agent and Lenders agree to enter into negotiations in order to amend such provisions of the Agreement so as to equitably reflect such Accounting Changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating Borrowers and their Subsidiaries financial condition shall be the same after such Accounting Changes as if such Accounting Changes had not been made;
provided
,
however
, that the agreement of Requisite Lenders to any required amendments of such provisions shall be sufficient to bind all Lenders. 
Accounting Changes

If Agent, Borrowers and Requisite Lenders agree upon the required amendments, then after appropriate amendments have been executed and the underlying Accounting Change with respect thereto has been implemented, any reference to GAAP contained in the Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall, only to the extent of such Accounting Change, refer to GAAP, consistently applied after giving effect to the implementation of such Accounting Change. If Agent, Borrowers and Requisite Lenders cannot agree upon the required amendments within thirty (30) days following the date of implementation of any Accounting Change, then all Financial Statements delivered and all calculations of financial covenants and other standards and terms in accordance with the Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be prepared, delivered and made without regard to the underlying Accounting Change.

Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Agreement, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Agreement shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in
Section 6
of the Agreement or this
Annex G
shall be made, without giving effect to (i) any election under Accounting Standards Codification 825-10 (or any other Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of any Sotheby Entity at fair value and (ii) any change to, or modification of, GAAP which would require the capitalization of leases that are characterized as (or would have been characterized as) operating leases as of the Restatement Effective Date.

Additionally, the Company will pay his medical and dental coverage pursuant to COBRA for twelve months, plus one additional month for each full year of employment with the Company (not to exceed eighteen months).

Press Release New York
SOTHEBY'S REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS; ANNOUNCES BUYER'S PREMIUM INCREASE
February 28, 2013, New York - Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2012.
For the full year 2012, Sotheby's reported total revenues of $768.5 million, a $63.3 million (8%) decline from the prior year. This decrease is largely attributable to a $79.4 million (11%) drop in auction commission revenues resulting from a 10% reduction in net auction sales, as 2011 included a record level of sales from single owner collections. The decline in auction commission revenues is partially offset by a $6.8 million (10%) improvement in private sale commission revenues and a $5.7 million (47%) increase in finance revenues.
Sotheby's reported net income of $108.3 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in 2012, a $63.1 million (37%) decrease from 2011 partially due to the aforementioned reduction in revenues. In late 2012, Sotheby's refinanced its long-term bonds by ten years, to 2022, and, as a result, incurred a $15.0 million pre-tax bond redemption loss ($8.3 million after taxes, or $0.12 per diluted share) that negatively impacted the comparison to the prior year. This long-term refinancing will reduce Sotheby's financing costs by approximately $5 million per year, beginning in 2014. In addition, in December, Sotheby's extended and improved its credit facility, further improving its liquidity and lowering its cost of funds. The comparison of 2012 net income to the prior year is also unfavorably

impacted by a non-recurring $13.6 million tax benefit recognized in 2011 due to the reversal of a valuation allowance against certain of Sotheby's deferred tax assets.
 
Consolidated sales
*
in 2012 were a robust $5.4 billion as healthy bidding continued around the world for great works of art, said Bill Ruprecht, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Our operating results reflect some significant successes, a stiff comparison to one of the best years in Sotheby's history a year ago, and a very competitive climate for high-end consignments. Overall, I remain confident in the marketplace.
Private sales
*
, an increasingly important part of Sotheby's business, totaled a record $906.5 million, an 11% increase. And as of the end of 2012, the Company's finance segment loan portfolio balance was $425.1 million, almost double the prior year balance of $223.0 million, and near peak levels.
Sotheby's ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and we are continuing to invest in our business, said Ruprecht. As a result, 2012 was a year of meaningful progress in the development of our client-focused strategy. We have totally reengineered our post-sale client services in our key sales centers of London and New York and made an array of enhancements to facilitate and personalize the client experience. Sotheby's is a global pioneer in broadening the art market and offering the highest levels of client service - and we dramatically demonstrated that across the business in 2012.
The global reach of our team is central to our success and the value we add for our clients. We are the first Western auction house to hold an auction in mainland China through a ground-breaking joint venture which will allow us to take advantage of a planned Beijing free port project, providing a tax-advantaged platform for storage, selling, exhibition and educational activities. We're the only auction house with a formal presence in Brazil and Argentina, among our 90 offices worldwide,
2
Exhibit 99.1
we're the only auction house to hold sales in Doha, Qatar, and we have received bids from over 120 countries in 2012, he continued.
We are pushing innovations on our web platform to make art more accessible and to reward our best clients. We offer our clients personalized account information in the language of their choice, we're the only auction house to provide digital catalogues and a magazine in downloadable format, and the only auction house with a Catalogue App program that offers twirling 360 degree views, note taking, real-time sale results and video. We reward our best clients through Art Fair VIP opportunities and perquisites at more than 100 partner museums, said Ruprecht.
Sotheby's is the first auctioneer to have a dedicated private sales exhibition gallery (S/2) within its headquarters in New York and office in Hong Kong and will open a third gallery at its London office this year. Last year, the Company held seven private sales exhibitions in partnership with renowned artists and tastemakers.
The Company remains sharply focused on developing its presence in China, deepening its relationships with Chinese art collectors in a number of tangible ways, including the expanded use of Chinese language on the website, Chinese e-catalogues, investing in Asian client-service staff, expansion of Sotheby's Hong Kong premises and an increased number of auction and private selling events in Asia. This year, Sotheby's will celebrate the 40
th
anniversary of its Hong Kong office - the oldest Western auction house in Hong Kong.
These achievements should provide Sotheby's with a solid platform for growth as well as a more diversified revenue stream in future years, said Ruprecht.

Exhibit 99.1
Year to Date 2013
Sotheby's annual Old Masters Week auctions in late January in New York brought a total of $80.1 million and was highlighted by an exceptional work by Pompeo Girolamo Batoni from 1751,
Susanna and the Elders
, which exceeded the pre-sale estimate of $6/9 million and brought $11.4 million, a record for the artist at auction.
Sotheby's February sales of Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art in London brought a combined total of $374.2 million and the top two prices of the year thus far. The Impressionist and Modern Art sale was led by Pablo Picasso's,
Femme Assise Prs D'Une Fentre
from 1932; a monumental work which introduced his 'golden muse' Marie-Thrse to the public eye and sold for $45.0 million. Highlighting the Contemporary Art sales was Francis Bacon's triptych,
Three Studies for a Self-Portrait
, from 1980 which brought $21.5 million and was painted when the artist was 71 years old.
Year to date 2013 sales are up over 30% but the sales growth experienced thus far this year has been in the most competitive areas of Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art where the climate for the most high-value consignments remains very competitive and with such consignments often earning thinner auction commission margins. Due to the seasonality of the sales calendar, the first quarter is typically a loss quarter for Sotheby's, with the anomaly of having the majority of its sales at the highest end of the market. In order to enhance its revenue stream and strengthen profit margins, Sotheby's is today announcing its first pricing change in almost five years. Effective as of March 15, buyers at auction will pay 25% on the first $100,000 of hammer price; 20% on the portion of hammer price above $100,000 up to and including $2 million; and 12% on any remaining amount above $2 million. For over 98% of lots sold, this change will represent an increase of 2% or less in the final purchase price and for all lots, a maximum 3.6% increase in the final purchase price.

Upcoming Sales
From April 3
rd
to 8
th
, Sotheby's will hold its spring series of sales in Hong Kong. Highlighting the sales is
A Magnificent Ruby-Ground Falangcai 'Double-Lotus' Bowl
from the Collection of Dr. Alice Cheng (pre-sale estimate of $10 million),
20th Century Chinese artist Zao Wou-ki's majestic and rare diptyque
10.3.83
(pre-sale estimate of $3/4 million) and a 3.04-Carat Fancy Intense Blue Diamond, Pink Diamond And Diamond Ring (pre-sale estimate of $2/3 million). Also, in our Contemporary Asian Art sale will be the Kurokochi Collection of works by Yoshitomo Nara. The 35 lots were collected between 1988 and 2006 and is the first private collection to come to auction dedicated to the works of the renowned contemporary Japanese artist.

Press Release New York
SOTHEBY'S REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2013 FINANCIAL RESULTS
May 9, 2013, New York - Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013.
Sotheby's reported first quarter total revenues of $101.7 million, a $3.2 million, or 3%, decrease from the prior year, principally due to a decline in auction commission margin to 15.0% from 18.1% in the prior year first quarter. Net auction sales increased 23% in the first quarter as compared to the prior year, but this improvement was in the most competitive categories of Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art, where the climate for the most high-value consignments remains very competitive and with such consignments often earning thinner auction commission margins. In the first quarter, there was a 35% increase in the total sale price of lots sold over $1 million, where auction commission margin experiences the most pressure.
In order to enhance revenue and strengthen auction commission margins, Sotheby's enacted a change to its buyer's premium rate structure that became effective March 15, 2013. Buyers at auction now pay 25% on the first $100,000 of hammer price; 20% on the portion of hammer price above $100,000 up to and including $2 million; and 12% on any remaining amount above $2 million. For over 98% of lots sold, this change represents an increase of 2% or less in the final purchase price and for all lots, a maximum 3.6% increase in the final purchase price. This price change did not have a material impact on Sotheby's results for the first quarter of 2013, as a large majority of Sotheby's auctions for the period were conducted prior to that date. However, based on sales results and
1
Exhibit 99.1
business-getting efforts to date, it is expected to contribute to an improvement in auction commission margin in the second quarter of 2013 when compared to the first quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2012.
Because of the seasonal nature of the art auction market, first and third quarter results have historically reflected a lower volume of auction activity when compared to the second and fourth quarters and, typically, a net loss due to the fixed nature of many of Sotheby's operating expenses. As a result, first quarter results are typically not indicative of expected full year results. Management believes that investors should focus on results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the auction market business cycle.
Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was ($22.3) million, or ($0.33) per diluted share, as compared to ($10.7) million, or ($0.16) per diluted share in the prior period. This decrease is largely due to the aforementioned decline in auction commission margin and to a lesser extent, an 8% increase in operating expenses, which in large measure is attributable to planned investments in support of Sotheby's strategic initiatives, including the development of Sotheby's presence in growth markets.
 
The first quarter showed a solid increase in auction sales compared to the prior year, but the results illustrate how competitive the market is for the highest value consignments. That competition resulted in lower commission margins, which is reflected on the bottom line. It's not where we prefer to be, but these results need to be seen in the context of thinking about the full year 2013. The increase in buyer's premium will help improve revenue margins as the year continues, said Chairman, President and CEO Bill Ruprecht.
2
Exhibit 99.1
The results also show that we continue to invest in the future, moving ahead with initiatives that expand our global relevance and reach: redefining and personalizing the client experience at Sotheby's, delivering web-based tools across the globe so our clients can engage with us anywhere, at any time on any device, presenting a host of truly exciting private sale shows in newly-designed galleries in New York, London and Hong Kong and, of course, expanding our presence in China and elsewhere, he continued.
We have historically adapted to a changing world. We are still an auction house, but today we are also much more. We have built on our 270 years of success to become an innovative and global art business. And with very good reason - new markets now account for 40% of worldwide buying activity in our sales rooms, said Ruprecht. This week's Evening Sale of Impressionist and Modern Art is a great example. We saw bidders from 45 countries participating - including the largest number from Latin America and Asia we have ever witnessed for an Evening Sale of Impressionist and Modern Art at Sotheby's. We are truly bringing a world of art to a new world.
Second Quarter Sales
This week in New York, exceptional works from prominent estate collections drove Impressionist & Modern Art sales to a strong total of $288 million, near the pre-sale high estimate of $296 million. Both the sales total and the sell-through rate of 84.5% for the evening sale rank among Sotheby's highest in this category in recent years. The top lots of the sales were from the collection of Alex & Elisabeth Lewyt - Paul Czanne's
Les Pommes
which sold for $41.6 million and Amedeo Modigliani's
L'Amazone
which sold for $25.9 million.
Last month in Hong Kong, an excellent group of sales brought a total of $280 million, at the high end of the pre-sale estimate. Over 3,100 lots were sold to buyers primarily from Asia but with worldwide competition. Solid prices were achieved throughout the week, with the Fine Chinese
3
Exhibit 99.1
Paintings auction more than doubling the pre-sale estimate, the Watches sale bringing the highest total ever for a sale of timepieces in Asia and for Sotheby's worldwide, and the Magnificent Jewels sale earning a per-carat auction record for a round white diamond with the sale of a stunning 28.86-carat Round D Flawless Diamond for $6.9 million, or $239,000 per carat.
Also last month, Sotheby's Contemporary Art sale in Doha brought outstanding results. The sale totaled $15.2 million, a record for a sale of Contemporary Art in the Middle East region and towards the high end of the pre-sale estimate. Records were set for nine artists, including a record for a living Arab artist. Bidders from fifteen countries across four continents participated in the sale which affirms the growing importance of Qatar in the international art world.
Sotheby's April sale of Magnificent Jewels in New York brought $53.5 million, the highest ever total for a spring sale of jewelry at Sotheby's New York and above the pre-sale estimate of $36/$49 million. Highlighting the sale was an exceptional pear-shaped diamond of nearly 75 carats which sold for $14.2 million, the record for any white diamond sold in the Americas.
Upcoming Sales
In New York next week, Sotheby's Contemporary Art sales have a number of exciting works on offer. Among them are Francis Bacon's
Study for a Portrait of P.L.
, which has not been seen since 1972, Gerhard Richter's historic and large scale
Domplatz Mailand,
and Barnett Newman's masterpiece
Onement VI
.
Each work carries a pre-sale estimate of $30/40 million and the sales series has a total pre-sale estimate of $350/$475 million.
Also next week is Sotheby's Magnificent Jewels sale in Geneva. Highlighting the 600+ lot sale is a 27.9 carat, D color and Internally Flawless Magnificent and Very Important Diamond Ring. The
4

ring has a pre-sale estimate of $4/$6 million and the total sale has a pre-sale estimate of $53/$79 million.
Sotheby's is proud to present a major exhibition of works by Jean-Michel Basquiat. Featuring over 30 works, the exhibition will showcase seminal pieces in a variety of mediums and from a range of important dates in the artist's oeuvre. The carefully curated grouping explores the key themes Basquiat grappled with during his career and the variety of media he used to express them. The exhibition opens at a pivotal moment of appreciation for both the artist's career and market with major museum exhibitions and gallery shows presented and record prices achieved in recent years. This exclusive selling exhibition opened last week at our S|2 gallery in New York and will continue through June 9
