Exhibit 99.1 [ABAXIS LOGO] Contact: Clint Severson RCG Capital Markets Group Chief Executive Officer Retail: Joe Dorame ABAXIS, Inc. Institutional/Analysts: Joe Diaz 510-675-6501 Media: Jeff Stanlis 480-675-0400 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ABAXIS TO COMPLY WITH PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION WHILE EVALUATING ITS LEGAL OPTIONS Union City, California - September 4, 2002 -- ABAXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABAX) announced that on September 3, 2002, the United States District Court of Maine issued a preliminary injunction in favor of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. under which Abaxis cannot, pending the resolution of patent litigation by IDEXX against Abaxis, make, use, sell, offer to sell or import the VetScan Canine Heartworm Antigen Test manufactured by S.A. Scientific, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas and sold by Abaxis. Abaxis disagrees with the Court's opinion and is evaluating its legal options, including an appeal of the order to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The VetScan canine heartworm test was introduced in December 2001 and constitutes approximately 3% of total Abaxis sales since that date. The granting of the preliminary injunction does not affect the sale and support of Abaxis' in-clinic veterinary chemistry and hematology analysis products, which form the core of Abaxis' VetScan line. "Although we disagree with the decision regarding the canine heartworm test, we of course plan to comply fully with the order," stated Clint Severson, CEO and Chairman of the Board. ABAXIS develops, manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any patient-care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements. The system consists of a compact, 6.9 kilogram, portable analyzer and a series of 8-cm diameter single-use plastic disks, called reagent discs, which contain all the reagents necessary to perform a fixed menu of tests. The system can be operated with minimal training and perform multiple tests on whole blood, serum, or plasma. The system provides test results in less than 14 minutes with the precision and accuracy equivalent to a clinical laboratory. This press release includes statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. ABAXIS claims the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Reform Act. Specific forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties that: - - Abaxis may be forced to pay Idexx monetary damages, be permanently enjoined from selling the canine heartworm product manufactured by S.A. Scientific, need to enter into a license agreement with Idexx pertaining to the patents, or a combination thereof;
- - In the event that Abaxis is enjoined from selling the canine heartworm antigen test manufactured by S.A. Scientific, Abaxis may be unable to either develop an alternate canine heartworm product that does not infringe upon the Idexx patents or Idexx may offer Abaxis commercially unfeasible terms for licensing their patents; and - - Even if Abaxis is successful in defending against the Idexx action, the defense of such claims may be exorbitant and may divert Abaxis management's focus away from running Abaxis' business Other risks and uncertainties related to Abaxis' business are detailed from time to time in Abaxis' periodic reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made. Abaxis does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Union City, California - December 11, 2002 -- ABAXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, announced today that on December 6, 2002 it reached an out-of-court settlement with IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. ("IDEXX") with respect to IDEXX' patent infringement lawsuit concerning the sale and manufacturing of a canine heartworm test kit manufactured by Abaxis partner and co-defendant S.A. Scientific, Inc., a privately held company located in San Antonio, Texas ("SAS")and sold by Abaxis. Accordingly, on December 10, 2002, the lawsuit was dismissed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. Under terms of the agreement and a joint defense agreement previously entered into by Abaxis and SAS, Abaxis will be responsible for paying $249,500 in cash damages to IDEXX, in return for which IDEXX has agreed to refrain from initiating further legal action under the patents at issue with respect to any future canine heartworm test that Abaxis and SAS may develop so long as any new canine heartworm test meets certain specifications set forth in the settlement agreement. Clint Severson, Chairman, President and CEO, commented, "This agreement satisfactorily resolves the issue and allows Abaxis to continue work to develop, manufacture and sell point of care tests in the veterinary and human markets. We will continue to work to develop new tests to broaden our product offerings, including tests for canine heartworm that do not utilize IDEXX' patented hypertonic solution method."

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 April 24, 2003 ABAXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported record financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and twelve month period ended March 31, 2003.
Union City, California
For the fourth fiscal quarter, the Company reported revenues of $10.2 million, compared with revenues of $8.2 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 24 percent. Net income for the quarter was $865,000 compared to net income of $637,000 for the same period last year. The increase in revenue and net income were the result of record rotor sales and increased instrument placements. The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.04 (calculated based on 17,129,000 shares) compared to diluted net loss per share of $(0.00) (calculated based on 16,335,000 shares) for the same period last year.
Quarterly Results:
: For the twelve month period ended March 31, 2003, revenues were $34.8 million, compared to $30.6 million for the same period last year, an increase of 14 percent. Net income for the twelve month period was $1,636,000 compared to net income of $1,304,000 for the same period last year, an increase of 25 percent. Diluted net income per share (inclusive of preferred dividend charges) was $0.02 (calculated based on 17,012,000 shares) compared to diluted net income per share of $0.02 (calculated based on 16,808,000 shares) for the same period last year.
Year-End Results
: Recurring reagent revenue for the fourth quarter was $6.6 million, up 12 percent over the $5.9 million reported in the same period last year. During the quarter, the Company sold 513,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs, an increase of 26 percent compared to 407,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year. The Company also sold 2,228 veterinary HMT reagent kits, up 1 percent compared to 2,196 HMT reagent kits sold for the same period last year. The Company sold 67 Piccolo portable medical blood analysis devices during the quarter, compared to 16 in the same period last year. Of the 67 Piccolo machines sold this quarter, 11 were sold to the military, 11 were sold in Europe, 24 were sold in Asia and 21 were sold in the U.S. medical market, whereas during the same period last year, 7 were sold to the military, 7 were sold in Europe and 2 were sold in the U.S. medical market.
Other Reported Information
Clint Severson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, "This year was a milestone year for Abaxis, as we topped $34 million in sales, helped in large part by 1.8 million medical and veterinary rotor sales, an 18% increase over the 2002 record. For the quarter, we exceeded the $10 million mark in revenues for the first time in the Company's history, reported record profitability, and paid off $1 million in debt. An increase of $717,000 or 57 percent in sales to the foreign market for the fourth quarter, compared to the same period last year, was attributed to a weaker dollar and an exclusive new distribution partnership with T. Chatani and Co of Japan. We
 
ABAXIS Reports 4th Quarter April 24, 2003 Page 2
finished the year with a strong balance sheet, more than $10 million in cash, and a strong base of instruments placed, including 186 Piccolos compared with 106, a 75 percent increase at the end of fiscal 2002. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with a large and growing base of instruments, is potentially indicative of ongoing strong medical and veterinary rotor sales and recurring revenue in 2004 and beyond."

Item 5.
Other Events.
          (a)        Adoption of Rights Agreement.
          On April 22, 2003, the Board of Directors of Abaxis, Inc. (the "Company") declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (each a "Right" and collectively the "Rights") for each outstanding share of Common Stock, no par value ("Common Stock"), of the Company. The distribution was paid as of May 8, 2003 (the "Record Date"), to shareholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company's Series RP Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value (the "Preferred Stock"), at a price of $24.00 (the "Purchase Price"). The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement dated as of April 23, 2003 (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Company and Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. (the "Rights Agent"). The summary of the Rights Agreement set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Rights Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
Distribution Date.
          Until the earlier to occur of (1) the first date of public announcement by the Company or by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons ("Acquiring Person"), other than the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan or employee stock plan of the Company including, without limitation, in its fiduciary capacity, or of any subsidiary of the Company, or any individual, firm, corporation, or any partnership, trust or other entity (a "Person") organized, appointed, established or holding Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or any Person funding other employee benefits for employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company ("Exempt Person"), that such an Acquiring Person has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, without (a) approval of the Board of Directors, or (b) either (i) a good faith determination of the Board of Directors that such Person has inadvertently become an Acquiring Person or (ii) within two business days of being requested by the Company to advise the Company regarding same, a written certification from such Person stating that such Person has inadvertently become an Acquiring Person, and in the case of either (i) or (ii), (iii) such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of shares of the outstanding Common Stock so that such Person would no longer beneficially own securities of the Company representing 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company (other than solely as a result of a reduction in the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company) or (2) the tenth business day (subject to extension by the Board prior to the time a person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or public announcement of an intention to commence, a tender or exchange offer by any person (other than by an Exempt Person), the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock by such person, together with its affiliates and associates (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to all shares of Common Stock that are issued after the Record Date prior to the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), by certificates representing such shares of Common Stock together with the Summary of Rights attached thereto.
Issuance of Rights Certificates; Expiration of Rights.
          The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be represented by and transferred with, and only with, the Common Stock. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), new certificates issued for Common Stock (including, without limitation, certificates issued upon transfer or exchange of Common Stock) after the Record Date, will contain a legend incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any of the Company's Common Stock certificates, with or without the
Table of Contents
aforesaid legend or the Summary of Rights attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Company's Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and such separate certificates alone will evidence the Rights from and after the Distribution Date. The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire upon the earlier of (i) ten years after the date of issuance, or April 22, 2013 or (ii) redemption or exchange by the Company.
Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.
          The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding dividends payable in Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). The number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock is also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of the Common Stock or a stock dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Stock occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
Rights and Preferences of Series RP Preferred Stock.
          The Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will be nonredeemable and junior to any other series of preferred stock the Company may issue (unless otherwise provided in the terms of such other series). Each share of Preferred Stock will have a preferential cumulative quarterly dividend in an amount equal to the greater of (a) $600.00 or (b) 1,000 times the dividend declared on each share of Common Stock. In the event of liquidation, the holders of Preferred Stock will receive a preferred liquidation payment equal to the greater of (a) $24,000.00 per share, plus accrued dividends to the date of distribution whether or not earned or declared, or (b) an amount per share equal to 1,000 times the aggregate payment to be distributed per share of Common Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the shares of Common Stock. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other securities, cash and/or other property, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount and type of consideration received per share of Common Stock. The rights of the Preferred Stock as to dividends, liquidation and voting, and in the event of mergers and consolidations, are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions. Fractional shares (in integral multiples of one one-thousandth) of Preferred Stock will be issuable; however, the Company may elect to distribute depositary receipts in lieu of such fractional shares. In lieu of fractional shares other than fractions that are multiples of one one-thousandth of a share, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise. Because of the nature of the Preferred Stock's dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.
Right to Buy Company Common Stock.
          In the event (i) any person becomes an Acquiring Person or (ii) any Acquiring Person or any of its Affiliates or Associates, directly or indirectly, (1) consolidates with or merges into the Company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise combines with the Company or any of its subsidiaries in a transaction in which the Company or such subsidiary is the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger or
Table of Contents
combination and the Common Stock of the Company remains outstanding and no shares thereof shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or of the Company or cash or any other property, (2) transfers, in on one or more transactions, any assets to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in exchange for capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or for securities exercisable for or convertible into capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise obtains from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, with or without consideration, any capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or securities exercisable for or convertible into capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than as part of a pro rata offer or distribution to all holders of such stock), (3) sells, purchases, leases, exchanges, mortgages, pledges, transfers or otherwise disposes to, from or with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, assets on terms and conditions less favorable to the Company or such subsidiary than the Company or such subsidiary would be able to obtain in arm's-length negotiation with an unaffiliated third party, (4) receives any compensation from the Company or any of its subsidiaries for services other than compensation for employment as a regular or part-time employee, or fees for serving as a director at rates in accordance with the Company's (or its subsidiary's) past practice, (5) receives the benefit (except proportionately as a shareholder) of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or tax credit or advantage, or (6) engages in any transaction with the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) involving the sale, license, transfer or grant of any right in, or disclosure of, any patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks or know-how (or any other intellectual or industrial property rights recognized under any country's intellectual property rights laws) which the Company (including its subsidiaries) owns or has the right to use on terms and conditions not approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, or (iii) while there is an Acquiring Person, there shall occur any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split), any recapitalization of the Company, or any merger or consolidation of the Company with any of its subsidiaries or any other transaction or transactions involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether or not involving the Acquiring Person) which have the effect of increasing by more than 1% the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the Acquiring Person (such events are collectively referred to herein as the "Flip-In Events"), then, and in each such case, each holder of record of a Right, other than the Acquiring Person, will thereafter have the right to receive, upon payment of the then current Purchase Price, in lieu of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock per outstanding Right, that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value at the time of the transaction equal to the Purchase Price (as adjusted to the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to the Flip-In Event multiplied by the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such Flip-In Event) divided by one-half the average of the daily closing prices per share of the Common Stock for the thirty consecutive trading days ("Current Market Price") on the date of such Flip-In Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Rights held by the Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate thereof or certain transferees will be null and void and no longer be transferable.
          The Company may at its option substitute for a share of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Rights in accordance with this paragraph such number or fractions of shares of Preferred Stock having an aggregate current market value equal to the Current Market Price of a share of Common Stock. In the event that insufficient shares of Common Stock are available to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing paragraph, the Board of Directors shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party, (A) determine the excess (such excess, the "Spread") of (1) the value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right in accordance with this paragraph (the "Current Value") over (2) the Purchase Price, and (B) with respect to each Right (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the foregoing paragraph), make adequate provision to substitute for the shares of Common Stock issuable in accordance with this paragraph upon exercise of the Right and payment of the Purchase Price, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in such Purchase Price, (3) shares of Preferred Stock or other equity securities of the Company (including, without limitation, shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock which, by virtue
Table of Contents
of having dividend, voting and liquidation rights substantially comparable to those of the shares of Common Stock, are deemed in good faith by the Board of Directors to have substantially the same value as the shares of Common Stock, (4) debt securities of the Company, (5) other assets, or (6) any combination of the foregoing, having a value which, when added to the value of the shares of Common Stock actually issued upon exercise of such Right, shall have an aggregate value equal to the Current Value (less the amount of any reduction in such Purchase Price); provided, however, that if the Company shall not make adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty (30) days following the Flip-In Event, then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of such Purchase Price, shares of Common Stock (to the extent available), and then, if necessary, such number or fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread. Rights are not exercisable following the occurrence of the events set forth in the foregoing paragraph until the expiration of the period during which the Rights may be redeemed as described below.
Right to Buy Acquiring Company Stock.
          Unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in the event that following the first occurrence of a Flip-In Event, the Company were to be acquired in a merger or other business combination in which any shares of the Company's Common Stock are exchanged or converted for other securities or assets (other than a merger or other business combination in which the voting power represented by the Company's securities outstanding immediately prior thereto continues to represent all of the voting power represented by the securities of the Company thereafter and the holders of such securities have not changed as a result of such transaction), or 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) were to be sold or transferred in one or a series of related transactions (such transactions are collectively referred to herein as the "Flip-Over Events"), the Rights Agreement provides that proper provision shall be made so that each holder of record of a Right (other than an Acquiring Person, or affiliates or associates thereof) will from and after such date have the right to receive, upon payment of the then current Purchase Price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a market value at the time of such transaction equal to the Purchase Price divided by one-half the Current Market Price of such common stock.
Cash Paid Instead of Issuing Fractional Shares.
          No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon exercise of the Rights and, in lieu thereof, a payment in cash will be made to the holder of such Rights equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a share of Common Stock.
Redemption.
          At any time until the occurrence of a Flip-In Event, the Board may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right. Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate, and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price without any interest thereon.
Exchange Provision.
          At any time after the occurrence of a Flip-In Event and prior to the earlier of a Flip-Over Event or such time as any Person (other than an Exempt Person), together with all Affiliates and Associates, becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the Common Stock outstanding, the Board of

Directors of the Company may, at its option, exchange all or any portion of the outstanding Rights (other than Rights held by any Acquiring Person which have become void) for shares of Common Stock on a pro rata basis, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock or one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (or of a share of a class or series of the Company's Preferred Stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges) per Right. Immediately upon the ordering of such exchange and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents pursuant to the exchange. In the event there are insufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights, the Company shall take all actions necessary to authorize additional shares.
Amendment of Rights Agreement.
          Until the Rights become nonredeemable the Company may, except with respect to the redemption price of the Rights, amend the Rights Agreement in any manner. After the Rights become nonredeemable, the Company may amend the Rights Agreement to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions, to shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement, or to arrange or supplement the provisions hereunder in any manner which the Company may deem necessary or desirable, provided that no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights (other than the Acquiring Person or its affiliates or associates) or cause the Rights to again be redeemable or the Agreement to again be freely amendable.
No Shareholder Rights Prior to Exercise.
          Until a Right is exercised, the holder, as such, will have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
Tax Consequences.
          The issuance of the Rights is not taxable to the Company or to shareholders under presently existing federal income tax law, and will not change the way in which shareholders can presently trade the Company's shares of Common Stock. If the Rights should become exercisable, shareholders, depending on then existing circumstances, may recognize taxable income.
Certain Anti-Takeover Effects.
          The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. Under certain circumstances the Rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Company's Board of Directors. However, the Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board.

RIGHTS AGREEMENT This Rights Agreement ("Rights Agreement"), is dated as of April 23, 2003, between Abaxis, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"), and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the "Rights Agent"). W I T N E S S E T H: - - - - - - - - - - WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company on April 22, 2003 (i) authorized the issuance and declared a dividend of one right ("Right") for each share of the common stock, no par value, of the Company outstanding as of the Close of Business (as such term is hereinafter defined) on May 8, 2003 (the "Record Date"), each Right representing the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Series RP Preferred Stock of the Company having the rights, powers and preferences set forth in the form of Certificate of Determination attached hereto as Exhibit A upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, and (ii) further authorized the issuance of one Right with respect to each share of Common Stock of the Company that shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the Distribution Date (as such term is hereinafter defined); NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties agree as follows: 1. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Rights Agreement the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: (a) "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all Affiliates (as such term is hereinafter defined) and Associates (as such term is hereinafter defined) of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that in no event shall a Person who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, is the Beneficial Owner of less than 15% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock, become an Acquiring Person solely as a result of a reduction of the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock, including repurchases of outstanding shares of Common Stock by the Company, which reduction increases the percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Person; provided, further, that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock then outstanding solely by reason of a reduction of the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock, and shall thereafter become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock of the Company, then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" if, upon any such subsequent acquisition or acquisitions such person becomes the Beneficial Owner of at least 15% of the Company's Common Stock then outstanding. An Acquiring Person shall not include an Exempt Person (as such term is hereinafter defined). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) either (x) the Board of Directors determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), has become such inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (A) such Person was unaware that it
beneficially owned a percentage of Common Stock that would otherwise cause such Person to be an "Acquiring Person" or (B) such Person was aware of the extent of its Beneficial Ownership but had no actual knowledge of the consequences of such Beneficial Ownership under this Rights Agreement) and without any intention of changing or influencing control of the Company, or (y) within two Business Days of being requested by the Company to advise the Company regarding same, such Person certifies in writing that such Person acquired Beneficial Ownership of 15% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock inadvertently or without knowledge of the terms of the Rights, and (ii) such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock so that such Person would no longer be an Acquiring Person, as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), then such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have become an Acquiring Person for any purposes of this Rights Agreement.

Person who is an officer, director or employee of an Exempt Person shall be deemed, solely by reason of such Person's status or authority as such, to be the Beneficial Owner of, to have "beneficial ownership" of, or to "beneficially own," any securities that are "beneficially owned" (as defined in this Section 1(c)), including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, by an Exempt Person or by any other such officer, director or employee of an Exempt Person. For all purposes of this Rights Agreement, any calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any particular time, including any calculation for purposes of determining the particular percentage of such outstanding shares of Common Stock of which any Person is the Beneficial Owner, shall be made in accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the date hereof.

(c) Rights shall be issued in respect of all shares of Common Stock that are issued (either as an original issuance or from the Company's treasury) after the Record Date and prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date. With respect to certificates representing such shares of Common Stock, the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates for Common Stock registered in the names of the holders thereof together with the Summary of Rights. Until the Distribution Date (or, if earlier, the Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date (with or without a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto), shall also constitute the surrender for transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented thereby. 6
(d) Certificates issued for Common Stock (including, without limitation, certificates issued upon transfer or exchange of Common Stock) after the Record Date but prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend: This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in the Rights Agreement between Abaxis, Inc. and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, dated as of April 23, 2003, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive office of Abaxis, Inc. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this certificate. Abaxis, Inc. will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt by it of a written request therefor. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS PROVIDED IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT, RIGHTS ISSUED TO, BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY OR TRANSFERRED TO ANY PERSON WHO IS OR BECOMES AN ACQUIRING PERSON (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT) OR AN ASSOCIATE OR AFFILIATE (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT) THEREOF AND CERTAIN TRANSFEREES THEREOF WILL BE NULL AND VOID AND WILL NO LONGER BE TRANSFERABLE. With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificates shall, until the Distribution Date, be evidenced by such certificates alone, and registered holders of Common Stock shall also be the registered holders of the associated Rights, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate shall also constitute the surrender for transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented thereby. In the event that the Company purchases or acquires any shares of Common Stock after the Record Date but prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Expiration Date, any Rights associated with such shares of Common Stock shall be deemed canceled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the shares of Common Stock no longer outstanding. Notwithstanding this subsection (d), the omission of a legend shall not affect the enforceability of any part of this Rights Agreement or the rights of any holder of the Rights. 4. Form of Right Certificates. (a) The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase shares and of assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof), when, as and if issued, shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto and may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Rights Agreement, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Rights may from time to time be listed, or to conform to usage. Subject to the provisions of Sections 11, 13 and 22 hereof, the Right Certificates evidencing the Rights issued on the Record Date, whenever such certificates are issued, shall be dated as of the Record Date and the Right Certificates evidencing Rights to holders of record of Common Stock issued after the Record Date shall be dated as of the Record 7
Date but shall also be dated to reflect the date of issuance of such Right Certificate. On their face, Right Certificates shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase, for each Right, one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, or other securities or property as provided herein, as the same may from time to time be adjusted as provided herein, at the price per one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock of $24.00, as the same may from time to time be adjusted as provided herein (the "Purchase Price"). (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Rights Agreement, any Right Certificate that represents Rights that are or were at any time on or after the earlier of the Stock Acquisition Date or the Distribution Date beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate thereof (or any transferee of such Rights) shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to it (if the Company or the Rights Agent has knowledge that such Person is an Acquiring Person or an Associate or Affiliate thereof or transferee of such Persons or a nominee of any of the foregoing) the following legend: The beneficial owner of the Rights represented by this Right Certificate is an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) of an Acquiring Person or a subsequent holder of such Right Certificates beneficially owned by such Persons. Accordingly, this Right Certificate and the Rights represented hereby are null and void and will no longer be transferable as provided in the Rights Agreement. The provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 24 of this Rights Agreement shall be operative whether or not the foregoing legend is contained on any such Right Certificates. 5. Countersignature and Registration. (a) The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer, its President or any Vice President, either manually or by facsimile signature, and have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile thereof which shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall be countersigned, either manually or by facsimile, by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned. In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent, issued and delivered with the same force and effect as though the person who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Rights Agreement any such person was not such an officer. (b) Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at one of its offices designated for such purposes, records for registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such records shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each 8
of the Right Certificates, the date of each of the Right Certificates and the certificate numbers for each of the Right Certificates. 6. Transfer, Split Up, Combination and Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates. (a) Subject to the provisions of Sections 7(e), 11(a)(ii) and 14 hereof, at any time after the Close of Business on the Distribution Date and at or prior to the Close of Business on the Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Certificates (other than Right Certificates representing Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof or that have been exchanged pursuant to Section 24 hereof) may be (i) transferred or (ii) split up, combined or exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a like number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer any Right Certificate shall surrender the Right Certificate at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purposes with the form of assignment on the reverse side thereof duly endorsed (or enclose with such Right Certificate a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Rights Agent), duly executed by the registered holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and with such signature guaranteed by a member of a securities approved medallion program. Any registered holder desiring to split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be split up, combined or exchanged at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purposes. Thereupon the Rights Agent shall, subject to Sections 4(b), 7(e), 11 and 14 hereof, countersign (by manual or facsimile signature) and deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates. (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, if requested by the Company, reimbursement to the Company of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will execute and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for delivery to the registered owner in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated. 7. Exercise of Rights; Purchase Price; Expiration Date of Rights. (a) Subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the Rights shall become exercisable, and may be exercised to purchase Preferred Stock, except as otherwise provided herein, in whole or in part at any time after the Distribution Date upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of election to purchase on the reverse side thereof duly executed (with such signature duly guaranteed), to the Rights Agent at 150 Royall Street, Canton, MA 02021, Attention: Client Administration, together with payment of the Purchase Price with respect to each Right exercised, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided, at or prior to the Close of Business on 9

(b) The Purchase Price and the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or consideration to be acquired upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof. The Purchase Price shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America, in accordance with Section 7(c) hereof. (c) Except as provided in Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, upon receipt of a Right Certificate with the form of election to purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of the Purchase Price (as such amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) hereof) or so much thereof as is necessary for the shares to be purchased and an amount equal to any applicable tax or governmental charge, by cash, certified check or official bank check payable to the order of the Company or the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent shall, subject to Section 20(k) hereof, thereupon promptly (i) requisition from any transfer agent of the Preferred Stock (or make available if the Rights Agent is the transfer agent) certificates for the number of shares of Preferred Stock so elected to be purchased and the Company will comply and hereby authorizes and directs such transfer agent to comply with all such requests, (ii) requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14(b) hereof, and (iii) promptly after receipt of such Preferred Stock certificates cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated by such holder, and, when appropriate, after receipt of the cash requisitioned from the Company promptly deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate. In the event of a purchase of securities, other than Preferred Stock, pursuant to Section 11(a) or Section 13 hereof, the Rights Agent shall promptly take the appropriate actions corresponding to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii). In the event that the Company is obligated to issue other securities of the Company, pay cash and/or distribute other property pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the Company will make all arrangements necessary so that such other securities, cash and/or other property are available for distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate. (d) Except as otherwise provided herein, in case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Sections 6 and 14 hereof. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder upon the occurrence of any purported exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the 10
Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request. 8. Cancellation and Destruction of Right Certificates. All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in canceled form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be canceled by it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all canceled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of the Company, destroy such canceled Right Certificates, and in such case shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Company. 9. Reservation and Availability of Shares of Preferred Stock. (a) The Company covenants and agrees that at all times it will cause to be reserved and kept available, out of and to the extent of its authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock not reserved for another purpose (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) or held in its treasury, the number of shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) that, as provided in this Rights Agreement, including Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights; provided, however, that the Company shall be required to reserve and keep available shares of Preferred Stock or other securities sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights pursuant to the adjustments set forth in Section 11(a)(ii), Section 11(a)(iii) or Section 13 hereof only if, and to the extent that, the Rights become exercisable pursuant to such adjustments. (b) The Company shall (i) use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Rights and all shares of Preferred Stock (and following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) issued or reserved for issuance upon exercise thereof to be reported by NASDAQ or such other system then in use, and if the Preferred Stock shall become listed on any national securities exchange, to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Rights and all shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) issued or reserved for issuance upon exercise thereof to be listed on such exchange upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise and (ii) if then necessary, to permit the offer and issuance of such shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities), register and qualify such shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws (to the extent exemptions therefrom are not available), cause such registration statement and qualifications to become effective as soon as possible after such filing and keep such registration and qualifications effective until the Expiration Date of the Rights. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed 90 days, the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act and permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement 11
stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. Notwithstanding any provision of this Rights Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless the requisite qualification in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained and until a registration statement under the Securities Act (if required) shall have been declared effective. (c) The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred Stock (and following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such shares (subject to payment of the Purchase Price in respect thereof), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares in accordance with applicable law. (d) The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all taxes and governmental charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any shares of Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case may be) upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax or governmental charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates for Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case may be) upon exercise of Rights in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver a Right Certificate or certificate for Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case may be) to a Person other than such registered holder until any such tax and governmental charge shall have been paid (any such tax or governmental charge being payable by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's satisfaction that no such tax or governmental charge is due. 10. Preferred Stock Record Date. Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares of Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case may be) is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case may be) represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate, as such, shall not be entitled to any rights of a shareholder of the Company with respect to the shares for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, if any, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein. 11. Adjustments to Number and Kind of Shares, Number of Rights or Purchase Price. The number and kind of shares subject to purchase upon the exercise of each Right, the number of Rights outstanding and the Purchase Price are subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 12
(a) (i) In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Rights Agreement (A) declare or pay any dividend on Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred Stock, (B) subdivide or split the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into a greater number of shares, (C) combine or consolidate the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into a smaller number of shares or effect a reverse split of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and the number and kind of shares of Preferred Stock or capital stock, as the case may be, issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive, upon payment of the Purchase Price then in effect, the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock or other securities, which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date, the holder thereof would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification. If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both this Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii). (ii) Subject to Section 24, in the event (A) any Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate of any Acquiring Person, at any time after the date of this Rights Agreement, directly or indirectly, (1) shall consolidate with or merge with and into the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise combine with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the Company or such Subsidiary shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation, merger or combination and the Common Stock of the Company shall remain outstanding and no shares thereof shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of the Company or of any other Person or cash or any other property, or (2) shall, in one or more transactions, other than in connection with the exercise of a Right or Rights and other than in connection with the exercise or conversion of securities exercisable for or convertible into securities of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, transfer any assets or property to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in exchange (in whole or in part) for any shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise obtain from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with or without consideration, any additional shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than as part of a pro rata offer or distribution by the Company or such Subsidiary to all holders of such shares), or (3) shall sell, purchase, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or otherwise acquire (other than as a pro rata dividend) or dispose of, to, from or with, as the case may be (in one transaction or a series of transactions), the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any assets (including securities) on terms and conditions less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary than the Company or such Subsidiary would be able to obtain in arm's-length negotiation with an unaffiliated third party, or (4) shall receive any compensation from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for services other than compensation for employment as a 13
regular or part-time employee, or fees for serving as a director, at rates in accordance with the Company's (or its Subsidiary's) past practices, or (5) shall receive the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or tax advantage provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (6) shall engage in any transaction with the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) involving the sale, license, transfer or grant of any right in, or disclosure of, any patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual or industrial property rights recognized under any country's intellectual property laws which the Company (including its Subsidiaries) owns or has the right to use on terms and conditions not approved by the Board of Directors; or (B) any Person, alone or together with its Affiliates and Associates, shall become an Acquiring Person; or (C) during such time as there is an Acquiring Person, there shall be any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split), or any recapitalization of the Company, or any merger or consolidation of the Company with any of its Subsidiaries or any other transaction or series of transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of such Acquiring Person) which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing by more than 1% the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or securities exercisable for or convertible into equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which is directly or indirectly beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person (any of (A), (B) or (C) being referred to herein as a "Flip-In Event"); then upon the first occurrence of a Flip-In Event (i) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to the Flip-In Event multiplied by the number of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such Flip-In Event, whether or not such Right was then exercisable, and (ii) each holder of a Right, except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at a price equal to the Purchase Price (as so adjusted), in accordance with the terms of this Rights Agreement and in lieu of shares of Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall equal the result obtained by dividing the Purchase Price (as so adjusted) by 50% of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of such Flip-In Event; provided, however, that the Purchase Price (as so adjusted) and the number of shares of Common Stock so receivable upon the exercise of a Right shall, following the Flip-In Event, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with Section 11(f) hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, however, from and after the Flip-In Event, any Rights that are beneficially owned by (x) any Acquiring Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person), (y) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who becomes a transferee after the Flip-In Event or (z) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who became a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Flip-In Event pursuant to either (I) a transfer from the Acquiring Person to holders of its equity securities or to any Person with whom it has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether written or otherwise, regarding the transferred Rights or 14
(II) a transfer which the Board of Directors has determined is part of a plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether written or otherwise, which has the purpose or effect of avoiding the provisions of this paragraph, and subsequent transferees of such Persons, shall be null and void without any further action and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights under any provision of this Rights Agreement. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder. From and after the Flip-In Event, no Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 or Section 6 hereof that represents Rights that are or have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent that represents Rights that are or have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be canceled. (iii) The Company may at its option substitute for a share of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) such number or fractions of shares of Preferred Stock having an aggregate current market value equal to the Current Market Price of a share of Common Stock. In the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Board of Directors shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party (A) determine the excess (such excess, the "Spread") of (1) the value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) (the "Current Value") over (2) the Purchase Price (as adjusted in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii)), and (B) with respect to each Right (other than Rights which have become null and void pursuant to the foregoing subparagraph (ii)), make adequate provision to substitute for the shares of Common Stock issuable in accordance with the foregoing paragraph (ii) upon exercise of the Right and payment of the Purchase Price (as adjusted in accordance therewith), (1) cash, (2) a reduction in such Purchase Price, (3) shares of Preferred Stock or other equity securities of the Company, including, without limitation, shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock which, by virtue of having dividend, voting and liquidation rights substantially comparable to those of the shares of Common Stock, are deemed in good faith by the Board of Directors to have substantially the same value as the shares of Common Stock (such shares of Preferred Stock and shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock being hereinafter referred to as "Common Stock Equivalents"), (4) debt securities of the Company, (5) other assets, or (6) any combination of the foregoing, having a value which, when added to the value of the shares of Common Stock actually issued upon exercise of such Right, shall have an aggregate value equal to the Current Value (less the amount of any reduction in such Purchase Price), where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board of Directors upon the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected in good faith by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that if the Company shall not make adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within 30 days following the date of the Flip-In Event (the "Flip-in Trigger Date"), then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of such Purchase Price, shares of Common Stock (to the extent available), and then, if necessary, such number or fractions of shares of Preferred Stock 15
(to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread. If the Board of Directors shall determine in good faith that it is likely that sufficient additional shares of Common Stock and/or Common Stock Equivalents could be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, the 30-day period set forth above may be extended to the extent necessary, but not more than 90 days after the Flip-In Trigger Date, in order that the Company may seek shareholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (such 30-day period, as it may be extended, being hereinafter referred to as the "Substitution Period"). To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the second and/or third sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to the last sentence of this Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights, and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any authorization of additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to the first sentence of Section 11(a)(iii) and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the Common Stock shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the Flip-In Trigger Date and the per share or per unit value of any Common Stock Equivalent shall be deemed to equal the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such date. The Board of Directors may, but shall not be required to, establish procedures to allocate the right to receive Common Stock upon the exercise of the Rights among holders of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii). (b) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights (other than the Rights), options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date), shares having the same rights, privileges and preferences as the Preferred Stock (a "Preferred Stock Equivalent") or securities convertible into Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalent at a price per share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalent (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalent) less than the Current Market Price per share of Preferred Stock on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding on such record date, plus the number of shares of Preferred Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock and/or Preferred Stock Equivalent (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such Current Market Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding on such record date, plus the number of additional shares of Preferred Stock and/or Preferred Stock Equivalent to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible). In case such subscription price may be paid by delivery of consideration part or all of which is in a form other than cash, the value of such non-cash consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent. Shares of Preferred Stock owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made 16
successively whenever such a record date is fixed, and in the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. (c) In case the Company shall fix a record date for a distribution to all holders of Preferred Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, cash, assets (other than a dividend payable in Preferred Stock, but including any dividend payable in stock other than Preferred Stock) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of Preferred Stock on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the cash, assets or evidences of indebtedness to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to a share of Preferred Stock and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of Preferred Stock. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would have been in effect if such record date had not been fixed. (d) (i) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, other than computations made pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, the "Current Market Price" per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of the Common Stock for the 30 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such date, and for purpose of computations made pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, the "Current Market Price" per share of the Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately following such date; provided, however, that in the event that the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of the Common Stock of (i) any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend and other than the Rights), (ii) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, and prior to the expiration of the requisite 30 Trading Day or 10 Trading Day period, as set forth above, after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification occurs, then, and in each such case, the Current Market Price shall be properly adjusted to take into account ex-dividend trading. The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the shares of Common Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading or, if the shares of Common Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted sale price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by NASDAQ or such other system then in use, or, if on any such date the shares of Common Stock 17
are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Common Stock selected by the Board of Directors. If on any such date no market maker is making a market in the Common Stock , the fair value of such shares on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors shall be used and shall be binding on the Rights Agent. If the Common Stock is not publicly held or not so listed or traded, "Current Market Price" per share shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes. (ii) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "Current Market Price" per share (or one one-thousandth of a share) of Preferred Stock shall be determined in the same manner as set forth above for the Common Stock in clause (i) of this Section 11(d) (other than the last sentence thereof). If the Current Market Price per share (or one one-thousandth of a share) of Preferred Stock cannot be determined in the manner provided above or if the Preferred Stock is not publicly held or listed or traded in a manner described in clause (i) of this Section 11(d), the "Current Market Price" per share of Preferred Stock shall be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to 1,000 (as such number may be appropriately adjusted for such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock occurring after the date of this Rights Agreement) multiplied by the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock, and the "Current Market Price" per one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock (as appropriately adjusted). If neither the Common Stock nor the Preferred Stock is publicly held or so listed or traded, "Current Market Price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes. (e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share of Common Stock or other share or one-hundred-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which mandates such adjustment, or (ii) the Expiration Date. (f) If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock other than Preferred Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right and the Purchase Price thereof shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock contained in Sections 11(a), (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (m) hereof, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 hereof with respect to the Preferred Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. 18
(g) All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of shares of Preferred Stock purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. (h) Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Sections 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment, by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price, and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price. (i) The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price or any adjustment to the number of shares of Preferred Stock for which a Right may be exercised made pursuant to Sections 11(a)(i), 11(b) or 11(c), to adjust the number of Rights in lieu of any adjustment in the number of shares of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after the adjustment in the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of shares of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement. (j) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price per 19
share and the number of shares which were expressed in the initial Right Certificate issued hereunder. (k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other capital stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action, including using its best efforts to obtain any required shareholder approvals, which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other capital stock at such adjusted Purchase Price. If upon any exercise of the Rights, a holder is to receive a combination of Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents, a portion of the consideration paid upon such exercise, equal to at least the then par value of a share of Common Stock of the Company, shall be allocated as the payment for each share of Common Stock of the Company so received. (l) In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date the shares of Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the shares of Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares of Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. (m) Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly permitted or required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that in their good faith judgment the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine to be advisable in order that any (i) consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred Stock, (ii) issuance for cash of any shares of Preferred Stock at less than the Current Market Price, (iii) issuance for cash of shares of Preferred Stock or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Preferred Stock, (iv) stock dividends or (v) issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 11, hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Stock shall not be taxable to such shareholders. (n) The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after the Distribution Date, (i) consolidate with any other Person, (ii) merge with or into any other Person, or (iii) sell or transfer (or permit any Subsidiary to sell or transfer), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any other Person or Persons, if (x) at the time of or immediately after such consolidation, merger or sale there are any charter or by-law provisions or any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding or agreements in effect which substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights or (y) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such consolidation, merger or sale, the shareholders of the Person who constitutes, or would 20
constitute, the Principal Party for purposes of Section 13(a) hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates and Associates. The Company shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger or sale unless prior thereto the Company and such other Person shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement evidencing compliance with this subsection. (o) The Company covenants and agrees that, after the Distribution Date, it will not, except as permitted by Section 23, Section 24 or Section 27 hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights. (p) Anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the Company shall at any time after the Record Date and prior to the Distribution Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on the outstanding shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock then outstanding, or issued or delivered thereafter, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the number of Rights thereafter associated with each share of Common Stock following any such event equals the result obtained by multiplying the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock immediately prior to such event by a fraction, the numerator or which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event. 12. Certification of Adjustments. Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof, the Company shall (a) promptly prepare a certificate signed by its Chief Executive Officer, its President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts giving rise to such adjustment, (b) promptly file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate (or, if prior to the Distribution Date, to each holder of a certificate representing shares of Common Stock) in accordance with Section 26 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the failure of the Company to give such notice shall not affect the validity of or the force or effect of or the requirement for such adjustment. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any certificate prepared by the Company pursuant to Sections 11 and 13 and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate. Any adjustment to be made pursuant to Sections 11 and 13 of this Rights Agreement shall be effective as of the date of the event giving rise to such adjustment. 13. Consolidation, Merger or Sale or Transfer of Assets or Earning Power. (a) In the event that following the first occurrence of a Flip-In Event, directly or indirectly, (x) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge with and into, any other Person 21
or Persons and the Company, as the case may be, shall not be the surviving or continuing Person of such consolidation or merger, or (y) any Person or Persons shall consolidate with, or merge with and into, the Company, and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger and, in connection with such consolidation or merger, all or part of the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other Person or of the Company or cash or any other property other than, in the case of the transactions described in subparagraphs (x) or (y), a merger or consolidation which would result in all of the Voting Power represented by the securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into securities of the surviving entity) all of the Voting Power represented by the securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and the holders of such securities not having changed as a result of such transactions), or (z) the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell, mortgage or otherwise transfer to any other Person or any Affiliate or Associate of such Person, in one transaction, or a series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), then, on the first occurrence of any such event (a "Flip-Over Event"), proper provision shall be made so that (i) each holder of a Right (other than Rights which have become null and void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the Purchase Price (as theretofore adjusted in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) hereof), in accordance with the terms of this Rights Agreement and in lieu of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock of the Company, such number of validly authorized and issued, fully paid, non-assessable and freely tradeable shares of Common Stock of the Principal Party (as such term is hereinafter defined), not subject to any liens, encumbrances, rights of first refusal or other adverse claims, as shall equal the result obtained by dividing the Purchase Price (as theretofore adjusted in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) by 50% of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock of such Principal Party (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; provided, however, that the Purchase Price (as theretofore adjusted in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) and the number of shares of Common Stock of such Principal Party so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with Section 11(f) hereof to reflect any events occurring in respect of the Common Stock of such Principal Party after the occurrence of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; (ii) such Principal Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such Flip-Over Event, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Rights Agreement; (iii) the term "Company" for all purposes of this Rights Agreement shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party, it being specifically intended that the provisions of Section 11 hereof shall only apply to such Principal Party following the first occurrence of a Flip-Over Event; and (iv) such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of shares of its Common Stock in accordance with Section 9 hereof) in connection with the consummation of any such transaction as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to its shares of Common Stock thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights; provided, however, that, upon the subsequent occurrence of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all assets, recapitalization, reclassification of shares, reorganization or other extraordinary transaction in respect of such Principal Party, each holder of a Right shall thereupon be entitled 22
to receive, upon exercise of a Right, such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property which such holder would have been entitled to receive had he, at the time of such transaction, owned the shares of Common Stock of the Principal Party purchasable upon the exercise of a Right, and such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, reservation of shares of stock) as may necessary to permit the subsequent exercise of the Rights in accordance with the terms hereof for such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property. (b) "Principal Party" shall mean (i) in the case of any transaction described in (x) or (y) of the first sentence of Section 13(a) hereof: (A) the Person that is the issuer of the securities into which shares of Common Stock of the Company are converted in such merger or consolidation, or, if there is more than one such issuer, the issuer the Common Stock of which has the greatest aggregate market value or (B) if no securities are so issued, (x) the Person that is the other party to the merger or consolidation and that survives said merger or consolidation, or, if there is more than one such Person, the Person the Common Stock of which has the greatest market value or (y) if the Person that is the other party to the merger or consolidation does not survive the merger or consolidation, the Person that does survive the merger or consolidation (including the Company if it survives); and (ii) in the case of any transaction described in (z) of the first sentence in Section 13(a) hereof, the Person that is the party receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to such transaction or transactions, or, if each Person that is a party to such transaction or transactions receives the same portion of the assets or earning power so transferred or if the Person receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power cannot be determined, whichever of such Persons that is the issuer of Common Stock having the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding; provided, however, that in any such case described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(i) or (b)(ii), (1) if the Common Stock of such Person is not at such time and has not been continuously over the preceding 12-month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another Person the Common Stock of which is and has been so registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to such other Person, or (2) if such Person is a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of more than one Person, the Common Stock of all of which are and have been so registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of the Common Stock having the greatest market value of shares outstanding, or (3) if such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, by a joint venture formed by two or more Persons that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the same Person, the rules set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above shall apply to each of the owners having an interest in the joint venture as if the Person owned by the joint venture was a Subsidiary of both or all of such joint venturers, and the Principal Party in each such case shall bear the obligations set forth in this Section 13 in the same ratio as its interest in such Person bears to the total of such interests. (c) The Company shall not consummate any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer referred to in Section 13(a) unless the Principal Party shall have a sufficient number of authorized shares of its Common Stock that have not been issued or reserved for issuance to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with this Section 13 and unless prior 23
thereto the Company and the Principal Party involved therein shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent an agreement confirming that the requirements of Sections 13(a) and (b) hereof shall promptly be performed in accordance with their terms and that such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets shall not result in a default by the Principal Party under this Rights Agreement as the same shall have been assumed by the Principal Party pursuant to Sections 13(a) and (b) hereof and further providing that, as soon as practicable after executing such agreement pursuant to this Section 13, the Principal Party at its own expense shall: (i) prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act, if necessary, with respect to the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the date of expiration of the Rights, and similarly comply with applicable state securities laws; (ii) use its best efforts, if the Common Stock of the Principal Party shall become listed on a national securities exchange, to list (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on such securities exchange and, if the Common Stock of the Principal Party shall not be listed on a national securities exchange, to cause the Rights and the securities purchased upon exercise of the Rights to be reported by NASDAQ or such other system then in use; (iii) deliver to holders of the Rights historical financial statements for the Principal Party which comply in all respects with the requirements for registration on Form 10 (or any successor form) under the Exchange Act; and (iv) obtain waivers of any rights of first refusal or preemptive rights in respect of the shares of Common Stock of the Principal Party subject to purchase upon exercise of outstanding Rights. In the event that any of the transactions described in Section 13(a) hereof shall occur at any time after the occurrence of a transaction described in Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the Rights which have not theretofore been exercised shall thereafter be exercisable in the manner described in Section 13(a). (d) Furthermore, in case the Principal Party which is to be a party to a transaction referred to in this Section 13 has a provision in any of its authorized securities or in its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or other instrument governing its corporate affairs, which provision would have the effect of (i) causing such Principal Party to issue, in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of a transaction referred to in this Section 13, shares of Common Stock of such Principal Party at less than the then Current Market Price per share (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) or securities exercisable for, or convertible into, Common Stock of such Principal Party at less than such then current market price (other than to holders of Rights pursuant to this Section 13) or (ii) providing for any special payment, tax or similar provisions in connection with the issuance of the Common Stock of such Principal Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 13; then, in such event, the Company hereby agrees 24
with each holder of Rights that it shall not consummate any such transaction unless prior thereto the Company and such Principal Party shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing that the provision in question of such Principal Party shall have been canceled, waived or amended, or that the authorized securities shall be redeemed, so that the applicable provision will have no effect in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of the proposed transaction. 14. Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares. (a) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the holders of record of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the then current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the then current market value of a Right shall be determined in the same manner as the Current Market Price of a share of Common Stock shall be determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof. (b) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock). Fractions of shares of Preferred Stock in integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it, provided, that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depositary receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as beneficial owners of the shares of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional shares of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents, the Company may pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock or a Preferred Stock Equivalent. For purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents shall be the Current Market Price of a share of Common Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise. (c) Following the occurrence of a Flip-In Event, the Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares or units of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or other securities upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or other securities. In lieu of fractional shares or units of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or other securities, the Company may pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the Current Market Value of a share or unit of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalent or other securities. For purposes of this Section 14(c), the Current Market Value shall be 25
determined in the manner set forth in Section 11(d) hereof for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise and, if such Common Stock Equivalent is not traded, each such Common Stock Equivalent shall have the value of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock. (d) The holder of a Right by the acceptance of a Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Right or any fractional shares upon exercise of a Right. 15. Rights of Action. As of the Record Date, all rights of action in respect of this Rights Agreement, other than any rights of action vested in the Rights Agent pursuant to Sections 18 and 20 hereof, are vested in the respective holders of record of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the holders of record of the Common Stock); and any holder of record of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock), may, in his own behalf and for his own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company or any other Person to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in this Rights Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Rights Agreement and, accordingly, that they will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Rights Agreement. Holders of Rights shall be entitled to recover the reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by them in any action to enforce the provisions of this Rights Agreement. 16. Agreement of Right Holders. Every holder of a Right by accepting the same consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of a Right that: (a) prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will not be evidenced by a Right Certificate and will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Stock; (b) after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates will be transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer; (c) the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated Common Stock certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right Certificate or the associated Common Stock certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent or the transfer agent of the Common Stock) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary; and (d) notwithstanding anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or other 26
Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Rights Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation; provided, however, that the Company must use its best efforts to have any such order, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible. 17. Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Shareholder. No holder of a Right, as such, shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends in respect of or be deemed for any purpose to be the holder of Common Stock or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote in the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting shareholders (except as provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights in respect of any such stock or securities, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof. 18. Concerning the Rights Agent. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Rights Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent for any thing done or omitted to be done by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Rights Agreement, including the cost and expenses of defending against any claim of liability in the premises. The indemnity provided herein shall survive the expiration of the Rights and the termination of this Rights Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Rights Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss damage and regardless of the form of action. (b) The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with its administration of this Rights Agreement in reliance upon any Right Certificate, certificate for Common Stock or other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, guaranteed, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons. 27
19. Merger or Consolidation or Changed Name of Rights Agent. (a) Any Person into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate trust or stock transfer business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such Person would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Rights Agreement, any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and, in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Rights Agreement. (b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Right Certificate shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Rights Agreement. 20. Duties of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations imposed by this Rights Agreement upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound: (a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion. (b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Rights Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter (including, without limitation, the identity of any Acquiring Person and the determination of Current Market Price) be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by certificate signed by the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Rights Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. 28
(c) The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. (d) The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Rights Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only. (e) The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Rights Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Rights Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any adjustment required under the provisions of Sections 11, 13, 23 or 24 hereof or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of a Certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12 describing any such adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Rights Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any shares of Common Stock will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable. (f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. (g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer. Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. Subject to Section 20(c) hereof, the Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted. 29
(h) The Rights Agent and any shareholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other entity. (i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof. (j) No provision of this Rights Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (k) If, with respect to any Right Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate contained in the form of assignment or the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse thereof, as the case may be, has either not been completed or indicates an affirmative response to clause 1 and/or 2 thereof, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise of transfer without first consulting with the Company. 21. Change of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Rights Agreement upon 30 days' notice in writing, or such earlier period as shall be agreed to in writing, mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent (with or without cause) upon 30 days' notice in writing, or such earlier period as shall be agreed to in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. In the event the transfer agency relationship in effect between the Company and the Rights Agent terminates, the Rights Agent will be deemed to resign automatically on the effective date of such termination and any required notice will be sent by the Company. If the Rights Agent shall otherwise resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 21, in no event shall the resignation or removal of a Rights Agent be effective until a successor Rights Agent shall have been appointed and have accepted such appointment. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the incumbent Rights Agent or the holder of record of any Right Certificate 30
may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (a) a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (b) an Affiliate controlled by a Person described in clause (a) of this sentence. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be. 22. Issuance of New Right Certificates. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price per share and the number or kind or class of shares of stock or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Rights Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights, the Company shall, with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities hereinafter issued by the Company, in each case existing prior to the Distribution Date, issue Right Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; provided, however, that (i) no such Right Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Person to whom such Right Certificate would be issued, and (ii) no such Right Certificate shall be issued, if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof. 23. Redemption. (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time prior to the earlier of (x) the first occurrence of a Flip-In Event or (y) the Close of Business on the Expiration Date, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.0001 per Right, as such amount may be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption Price"). 31
(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights (or at such later time as the Board of Directors may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption. Within 10 days after such action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights (or such later time as the Board of Directors may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption shall state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. The failure to give notice required by this Section 23(b) or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the action taken by the Company. (c) In the case of a redemption permitted under Section 23(a) hereof, the Company may, at its option, discharge all of its obligations with respect to the Rights by (i) issuing a press release announcing the manner of redemption of the Rights and (ii) mailing payment of the Redemption Price to the registered holders of the Rights at their last addresses as they appear on the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent of the Common Stock, and upon such action, all outstanding Right Certificates shall be null and void without any further action by the Company. 24. Exchange of Rights for Common Stock. (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after the occurrence of a Flip-In Event, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which (i) shall not include Rights that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, and (ii) shall include, without limitation, any Rights issued after the Distribution Date in accordance with Section 22 hereof) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (the "Exchange Ratio"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than an Exempt Person), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock aggregating 50% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. From and after the occurrence of an event specified in Section 13(a) hereof, any Rights that theretofore have not been exchanged pursuant to this Section 24(a) shall thereafter be exercisable only in accordance with Section 13 and may not be exchanged pursuant to this Section 24(a). (b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of shares of 32
Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the shares of Common Stock for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights. (c) In any exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Company, at its option, may substitute, and, in the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall substitute to the extent of such insufficiency, for each share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number of shares of Preferred Stock Equivalents or fractions thereof having an aggregate current per share market price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) equal to the current per share market price of one share of Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) as of the date of the Flip-In Event. (d) In the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary to authorize additional shares of Common Stock for issuance upon exchange of the Rights. (e) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Common Stock. In lieu of such fractional shares of Common Stock, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional shares of Common Stock would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock. For the purposes of this paragraph (d), the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock shall be the Current Market Price of a share of Common Stock (as defined in Section 11(d) hereof for the purposes of computations made other than pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii)) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this Section 24. 25. Notice of Proposed Actions. (a) In case the Company, after the Distribution Date, shall propose (i) to effect any of the transactions referred to in Section 11(a)(i) hereof or to pay any dividend to the holders of record of its Preferred Stock payable in stock of any class or to make any other distribution to the holders of record of its Preferred Stock (other than a regular periodic cash dividend), or (ii) to offer to the holders of record of its Preferred Stock or options, warrants, or other rights to 33
subscribe for or to purchase shares of Preferred Stock (including any security convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Stock) or shares of stock of any other class or any other securities, options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities or other rights, or (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Stock or any recapitalization or reorganization of the Company, or (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger with or into, or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more transactions, of more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any other Person or Persons, or (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, then, in each such case, the Company shall give to each holder of record of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such transaction referred to in Section 11(a)(i) hereof, or such dividend or distribution, or the date on which such reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets, liquidation, dissolution or winding up is to take place and the record date for determining participation therein by the holders of record of Preferred Stock, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least 10 days prior to the record date for determining holders of record of the Preferred Stock for purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of record of Preferred Stock, whichever shall be the earlier. (b) In case any of the transactions referred to in Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13 of this Rights Agreement are proposed, then, in any such case, the Company shall give to each holder of Rights, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, notice of the proposal of such transaction at least 10 days prior to consummating such transaction, which notice shall specify the proposed event and the consequences of the event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13 hereof, as the case may be, and, upon consummating such transaction, shall similarly give notice thereof to each holder of Rights. (c) The failure to give notice required by this Section 25 or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the action taken by the Company or the vote upon any such action. 26. Notices. Notices or demands authorized by this Rights Agreement to be given or made by the Rights Agent or by the holder of record of any Right Certificate or Right to or on behalf of the Company shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in writing with the Rights Agent) as follows: Abaxis, Inc. 3240 Whipple Road Union City, CA 94587 Attention: Corporate Secretary Subject to the provisions of Section 20 hereof, any notice or demand authorized by this Rights Agreement to be given or made by the Company or by the holder of record of any Right Certificate or Right to or on the Rights Agent shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in writing with the 34

Supplements and Amendments. Except as provided in the penultimate sentence of this Section 27, for so long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion, and the Rights Agent shall if the Company so directs, supplement or amend any provision of this Rights Agreement in any respect without the approval of any holders of the Rights. At any time when the Rights are no longer redeemable, except as provided in the penultimate sentence of this Section 27, the Company may, and the Rights Agent shall, if the Company so directs, supplement or amend this Rights Agreement without the approval of any holders of Right Certificates in order to (i) cure any ambiguity, (ii) correct or supplement any provision contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein, (iii) shorten or lengthen any time period hereunder, or (iv) change or supplement the provisions hereunder in any manner which the Company may deem necessary or desirable; provided, that no such supplement or amendment shall adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights as such (other than an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person), and no such amendment may cause the Rights again to become redeemable or cause the Agreement again to become amendable other than in accordance with this sentence. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, no supplement or amendment shall be made which changes the Redemption Price. Prior to the Distribution Date, the interests of the holders of Rights shall be deemed coincident with the interests of the holders of Common Stock. 29. Successors. All of the covenants and provisions of this Rights Agreement by or for the benefit of the Company or the Rights Agent shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns hereunder. 30.

Descriptive Headings. Descriptive headings of the several sections of this Rights Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof. 35. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Rights Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Rights Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

EXHIBIT C Summary of Rights to Purchase Preferred Stock UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS SET FORTH IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT DATED APRIL ___, 2003 (THE "RIGHTS AGREEMENT") BETWEEN ABAXIS, INC. AND EQUISERVE TRUST COMPANY, N.A., RIGHTS ISSUED TO, BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY OR TRANSFERRED TO ANY PERSON WHO IS OR BECOMES AN ACQUIRING PERSON (AS DEFINED IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT) OR AN ASSOCIATE OR AFFILIATE (AS DEFINED IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT) THEREOF AND CERTAIN TRANSFEREES THEREOF WILL BE NULL AND VOID AND WILL NO LONGER BE TRANSFERABLE. Abaxis, Inc. SUMMARY OF TERMS OF RIGHTS AGREEMENT NATURE OF RIGHT: When exercisable, each Right (a "Right") will initially entitle the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Series RP Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") of Abaxis, Inc. (the "Company"). MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION: The Rights will be distributed to holders of the Company's outstanding Common Stock as a dividend of one Right for each share of Common Stock. The Rights will also be attached to all future issuances of Common Stock prior to the Distribution Date (as defined below). EXERCISABILITY: Rights become exercisable on the earlier of: (i) the date of public announcement by the Company or by any person or group (an "Acquiring Person") that such person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock, or (ii) the tenth business day (unless extended by the Board prior to the time a person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement, or announcement of an intention to commence, by any person or group of a tender or exchange offer which would result in such person owning 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company (the earlier of such dates being referred to as the "Distribution Date"), provided, that an Acquiring Person does not include an Exempt Person (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement). Rights will trade separately from the Common Stock once the Rights become exercisable.
PURCHASE PRICE: $24.00 per one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, which is the amount that in the judgment of the Board of Directors represents the long-term value of the Common Stock over the term of the Rights Agreement (the "Purchase Price"). TERM: The Rights will expire upon the earlier of (i) ten years after the date of issuance, or April 22, 2013 or (ii) redemption or exchange by the Company as described below. REDEMPTION OF RIGHTS: Rights are redeemable at a price of $0.001 per Right, by the vote of the Company's Board of Directors, at any time until the occurrence of a Flip-In Event (defined below). PREFERRED STOCK: The Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will be nonredeemable and junior to any other series of preferred stock the Company may issue (unless otherwise provided in the terms of such other series). Each share of Preferred Stock will have a preferential cumulative quarterly dividend in an amount equal to the greater of (a) $600.00 or (b) 1,000 times the dividend declared on each share of Common Stock. In the event of liquidation, the holders of Preferred Stock will receive a preferred liquidation payment equal to the greater of (a) $24,000.00 per share, plus accrued dividends to the date of distribution whether or not earned or declared, or (b) an amount per share equal to 1,000 times the aggregate payment to be distributed per share of Common Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the shares of Common Stock. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other securities, cash and/or other property, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount and type of consideration received per share of Common Stock. The rights of the Preferred Stock as to dividends, liquidation and voting, and in the event of mergers and consolidations, are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions. Fractional shares (in integral multiples of one one-thousandth) of Preferred Stock will be issuable; however, the Company may elect to distribute depositary receipts in lieu of such fractional shares. In lieu of fractional shares other than fractions that are multiples of one one-thousandth of a share, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise. Because of the nature of the Preferred Stock's dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share
of Common Stock. RIGHTS IN EVENT OF In the event that an Acquiring Person engages in certain SELF-DEALING self-dealing transactions or becomes a beneficial owner TRANSACTION OR of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock ("Flip-In ACQUISITION OF Events"), a holder of a Right thereafter has the right SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF to purchase, upon payment of the then current Purchase COMMON STOCK: Price, in lieu of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock per outstanding Right, such number of shares of Common Stock having a market value at the time of the transaction equal to the Purchase Price divided by one-half the Current Market Price (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of the Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Rights held by the Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate thereof or certain transferees will be null and void and no longer be transferable. Self-dealing transactions are defined to include a consolidation, merger or other combination of an Acquiring Person with the Company in which the Company is the surviving corporation, the transfer of assets to the Company in exchange for securities of the Company, the acquisition of securities of the Company (other than in a pro rata distribution to all stockholders), the sale, purchase, transfer, distribution, lease, mortgage, pledge or acquisition of assets by the Acquiring Person to, from or with the Company on other than an arm's length basis, compensation to an Acquiring Person for services (other than for employment as a regular or part-time employee or director on a basis consistent with the Company's past practice), a loan or provision of other financial assistance (except proportionately as a stockholder) to an Acquiring Person or the licensing, sale or other transfer of proprietary technology or know-how from the Company to the Acquiring Person on terms not approved by the Board of Directors or a reclassification, recapitalization or other transaction with the effect of increasing by more than 1% the Acquiring Person's proportionate share of any class of securities of the Company.

EXCHANGE OPTION: In the event (i) any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person or (ii) any of the types of transactions, acquisitions or other events described above as self-dealing transactions occur, and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Board may require all or any portion of the outstanding Rights (other than Rights owned by such Acquiring Person which have become void) to be exchanged for Common Stock on a pro rata basis, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock or one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (or of a share of a class or series of the Company's Preferred Stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges), per Right (subject to adjustment). FRACTIONAL SHARES: No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon exercise of the Rights and, in lieu thereof, a payment in cash will be made to the holder of such Rights equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a share of Common Stock. ADJUSTMENT: The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding dividends payable in Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). The number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock is also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of the Common Stock or a stock dividend on the Common Stock payable in
Common Stock or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Stock occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date. RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER: The Rights themselves do not entitle the holder thereof to any rights as a stockholder, including, without limitation, voting rights or to receive dividends. AMENDMENT OF RIGHTS: Until the Rights become nonredeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the redemption price, amend the Agreement in any manner. After the Rights become nonredeemable, the Company may amend the Agreement to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions, to shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement, or to change or supplement any provision in any manner the Company may deem necessary or desirable, provided that no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights (other than the Acquiring Person or its Affiliates or Associates) or cause the Rights to again be redeemable or the Agreement to again be freely amendable.

Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series RP Preferred Stock" (the "Series RP Preferred Stock"), $0.001 par value per share, and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 300,000. Section 2. Dividends and Distributions. (A) The dividend rate on the shares of Series RP Preferred Stock shall be for each quarterly dividend (hereinafter referred to as a "quarterly dividend period"), which quarterly dividend periods shall commence on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date") (or in the case of original issuance, from the date of original issuance) and shall end on and include the day next preceding the first date of the next quarterly dividend period, at a rate per quarterly dividend period (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $600.00 or (b) subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in cash, based upon the fair market value at the time the non-cash dividend or other distribution is declared as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared (but not withdrawn) on the Common Stock, no par value, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock") during the immediately preceding quarterly dividend period, or, with respect to the first quarterly dividend period, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series RP Preferred Stock.

(ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series RP Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series RP Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series RP Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series RP Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series RP Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series RP Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 45 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series RP Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights: (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series RP Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation.

(B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, the holders of shares of Series RP Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corporation. (C) Except as set forth herein or as otherwise provided by General Corporation Law of the State of California ("California Law"), in the Articles of Incorporation and in the Bylaws, holders of Series RP Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and
their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. Section 4. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series RP Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof and become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock. Section 5. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. (A) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the Series RP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the greater of (a) $24,000.00 per share, plus accrued dividends to the date of distribution, whether or not earned or declared, or (b) an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series RP Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event pursuant to clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. Section 6. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series RP Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series RP Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. Section 7. No Redemption. The shares of Series RP Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable. Section 8. Fractional Shares. Series RP Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and have the benefit of all other
rights of holders of Series RP Preferred Stock. All payments made with respect to fractional shares hereunder shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. Section 9. Certain Restrictions. (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series RP Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series RP Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not: (i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series RP Preferred Stock; (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series RP Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series RP Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series RP Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series RP Preferred Stock; or (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series RP Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series RP Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes. Section 10. Ranking. The Series RP Preferred Stock shall be junior to all other Series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any series shall provide otherwise. Section 11. Amendment. The Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series RP Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds or more of the outstanding shares of Series RP Preferred Stock voting together as a single class.
The undersigned declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the matters set forth in the foregoing Certificate are true and correct of their own knowledge.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [ABAXIS LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ABAXIS ANNOUNCES ADOPTION OF STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS PLAN Union City, California - April 23, 2003-- ABAXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, announced today that its Board of Directors yesterday adopted a Stock Purchase Rights Plan designed to enable all Abaxis shareholders to realize the full value of their investment and to provide for fair and equal treatment for all Abaxis shareholders in the event that an unsolicited attempt is made to acquire Abaxis. The adoption of the Rights Plan is intended as a means to guard against any potential use of takeover tactics designed to gain control of Abaxis without paying all shareholders full and fair value. The distribution of the Rights is not in response to any proposal to acquire Abaxis. The Board is not aware of any such effort. Under the Rights Plan, shareholders of record at the close of business on May 8, 2003 will receive one share purchase Right for each share of Abaxis Common Stock held on that date. The Rights, which will initially trade with the Common Stock and represent the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of the new Preferred Stock at $24.00 per Right, become exercisable when a person or group acquires 15% or more of Abaxis's Common Stock without prior Board approval. In that event, the Rights permit Abaxis shareholders, other than the acquiror, to purchase Abaxis Common Stock having a market value of twice the exercise price of the Rights, in lieu of the Preferred Stock. Alternatively, when the Rights become exercisable, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of one share of Abaxis Common Stock in exchange for each Right that is then exercisable. In addition, in the event of certain business combinations, the Rights permit the purchase of the Common Stock of an acquiror at a 50% discount. Rights held by the acquiror will become null and void in each case. Prior to a person or group acquiring 15%, the Rights can be redeemed for $0.001 each by action of the Board. The Rights expire on April 22, 2013. The Rights distribution will not be taxable to shareholders and will be payable to shareholders of record on May 8, 2003. REMINDER OF QUARTERLY EARNINGS CALL As previously announced, Abaxis will hold a conference call to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and year-ended March 31, 2003. The call will be at 4:15 pm EDT (1:15 pm PDT) Thursday, April 24, 2003.

Clint Severson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, "This is the third consecutive quarter of record net income for Abaxis in a challenging economic environment, and I am particularly pleased with the strong increase in net income compared to the same period last year. While capital expenditures are down in almost every sector of our economy, doctors, veterinarians, and the U.S. military are increasingly investing in Abaxis' blood analyzers as a tool to improve their diagnostic abilities due to the impressive return on investment our technology affords practitioners."
Mr. Severson continued, "The continued strong performance validates Abaxis' superior technology and is a testament to the hard work of all Abaxis employees. We continue to have record medical sales each quarter, including particularly strong sales to the U.S. military market. This has led to continued record sales of rotors, which continues to create strong recurring revenue streams, as well as earnings, for Abaxis and its shareholders. I remain confident that our technology represents a substantial benefit to veterinarians, doctors, the U.S. military and other users who require a small, rapid and affordable solution for routine blood analysis. Abaxis provides the ideal solution for these markets."

Highlights for the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004 include: * Quarterly revenues of $11.5 million, the third consecutive quarter of revenues exceeding $10 million and a 32% increase over the same period last year. * Diluted earnings per share of $0.05 for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, compared to a diluted loss per share of $(0.01) in the same period last year. * U.S. sales of $9.8 million, a 31% increase over the same period last year. * International sales of $1.7 million, a 41% increase over the same period last year. * Medical sales of $1.6 million, representing 14% of total revenues. * Recurring reagent disc and HMT reagent revenue of $6.7 million, a 24% increase over the same period last year. * More than 549,000 units of reagent discs sold, resulting in the fifth consecutive quarter of record reagent disc sales. * Medical reagent disc sales of 43,000 units, a 126% increase over the same period last year. * Record veterinary reagent discs sales of 507,000 units, an 18% increase over the same period last year. Quarterly Results: For the second fiscal quarter, Abaxis reported record total revenues of $11.5 million, as compared with revenues of $8.7 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 32 percent. The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.05 (calculated based on 18,933,000 shares) compared to a diluted net loss per share of $(0.01) (calculated based on 16,534,000 shares) for the same period last year. Net income before accrued preferred dividends and accretion of the value attributable to the beneficial conversion feature of previously issued preferred stock for the quarter was $1,066,000 compared to $101,000 for the same period last year, an increase of $965,000. The increase in revenue and net income before accrued preferred dividends and accretion of the value attributable to the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock were the result of record reagent disc sales and increased instrument placements, representing increases of 24 percent and 61 percent, respectively, over the same period last year. Six Months Results: For the six-month period ended September 30, 2003, Abaxis reported total revenues of $21.8 million, as compared with revenues of $16.1 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 36 percent. Net income before accrued preferred dividends and accretion of the value attributable to the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock for the first six months of fiscal 2004 was $1,929,000, as compared to $406,000 for the same period last year, an increase of $1,523,000. The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.08 (calculated based on 18,170,000 shares) compared to a diluted net loss per share of $(0.03) (calculated based on 16,463,000 shares). Other Reported Information: Recurring reagent disc and HMT reagent revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $6.7 million, up 24 percent over the $5.4 million reported in the same period last year. During the quarter, the Company sold 549,400 medical and veterinary reagent discs, an increase of 22 percent compared to 449,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year. The Company sold 2,729 veterinary HMT reagent kits during the quarter, up 22 percent compared to 2,230 HMT reagent kits sold for the same period last year. The number of shares used in calculating diluted net income per share for the Company increased by 1,453,000 shares resulting from (a) the elective conversion of a portion of the Company's preferred stock into 157,000 shares of common stock, (b) the inclusion of 1,224,000 shares issuable upon the exercise of employee stock options because such options are now 'in-the-money' as the per share exercise price of such options no longer exceeds the fair market value of Abaxis common stock, (c) the issuance of 29,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants and options, and (d) the inclusion of 43,000 shares due to the change in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding from the first fiscal quarter of 2004. Thus, diluted net income per share increased both over the previous quarter and over the same period last year despite that total outstanding common stock shares over which net income is spread increased by 8.3% and 14.5%, respectively. Separately, as announced, yesterday, October 15, 2003, all of Abaxis' Series E Preferred Stock converted into shares of the Company's common stock, resulting in the conversion of 4,450 shares of Series E Preferred Stock into 684,615 additional shares of common stock subsequent to September 30, 2003. The automatic conversion means that Abaxis will no longer have to pay semi- annual dividends in cash or stock in an annual amount of $65.00 per share of Series E Preferred Stock. In addition, should the closing price of Abaxis' common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market continue to exceed $14.00 per share through October 28, 2003, all shares of Abaxis' Series D Preferred Stock will automatically convert on that date. Clint Severson, chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "The quarter saw strong revenue contributions from all product lines on a comparable year-over-year basis. We are particularly pleased that international sales registered a 41 percent increase for the quarter over the same period last year, tracking with the upward trend that we have been experiencing in domestic sales in the past four quarters. Selected international markets represent new opportunities for all of our product lines and we are dedicated to the strategic development of those markets." Mr. Severson continued, "The introduction of three new Piccolo medical panels during the quarter completes the full array of human medical panels as defined by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services for reimbursement. The full array, together with Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, positions the Piccolo line of products for greater acceptance and penetration in the majority of the 25,000 physician office labs, urgent care centers, and small hospitals in the U.S. where the Piccolo represents a formidable diagnostic tool relative to convenience, cost and clinical utility. This full medical panel array is an important product offering for our outstanding sales team to continue the penetration of these key markets."

The Company sold 2,990 veterinary HMT reagent kits during the quarter, up 37 percent compared to 2,184 HMT reagent kits sold for the same period last year. "We are very pleased with the results of the quarter," commented Clint Severson, chairman, president and chief executive officer. We had strong revenue growth domestically, internationally and from all product lines. In addition to strong operating results, net income also benefited from the conversion of Series D and E Preferred Shares into Common Shares during the quarter. While outstanding common shares increased by 11 percent as a result of the conversion and warrant and option exercises, we were, nevertheless, able to report significant earnings per share increases for both the quarter and the nine-month period." Mr. Severson continued, "Reagent disc sales this quarter increased by 29 percent. Also during this third quarter the efforts of the sales group yielded a total of 521 medical and veterinary market instrument placements, setting the stage for increased reagent disc sales in the future. The recurring nature of reagent disc sales represents the foundation of our strategic business plan, and we are gratified to be successfully executing on that plan."

Item 12. On April 29, 2004, the Company released its quarterly and fiscal year 2004 earnings year end announcement (the "Earning Release") which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Earnings Release presents the Company's income from operations, net income, and net income per share on a pro forma basis excluding a one-time income tax benefit which is not a measurement of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management uses these measures in comparing the Company's historical performance and believes that these measures provide meaningful and comparable information to management and investors to assist in their review of the Company's performance relative to prior periods and its competitors. In the Earnings Release, the Company elected to present certain information on a pro forma basis to exclude the one-time tax benefit so as to provide investors with a more meaningful comparison with its historical results. The Earnings Release includes a schedule that reconciles the Company's statement of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to its results on a pro forma basis for the three- and twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004, the pro forma adjustment related to a one-time income tax benefit of $19,450,000. For fiscal 2004, the pro forma adjustment related a one-time income tax benefit of $19,450,000. Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated April 29, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 ABAXIS Reports Record Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2004 Full Year: Revenues up 35%; Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders totals $23.6 million (inclusive of a one-time income tax benefit of $19.5 million); Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders (before the one-time income tax benefit) totals $4.2 million, up 938% Fourth Quarter: Revenues up 25%; Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders totals $20.9 million (inclusive of a one-time income tax benefit of $19.5 million); Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders (before the one-time income tax benefit) totals $1.5 million, up 124% UNION CITY, Calif., April 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ABAXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported record financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2004 include: -- Quarterly Revenues: up 25% to $12.7 million; the fifth consecutive quarter of revenues exceeding $10 million. Annual Revenues: up 35% to $46.9 million year-over-year. -- One-time Income Tax Benefit of $19.5 million recorded relating to existing deferred tax assets previously fully reserved. -- Quarterly Diluted EPS: $0.96 (including $0.89 per share for the one-time income tax benefit) compared to $0.04 in the same period last year. Annual Diluted EPS: $1.16 (including $0.96 per share for the one-time income tax benefit) versus $0.02 in the previous fiscal year. -- Quarterly U.S. sales of $10.8 million, a 32% increase over the same period last year. -- Quarterly Medical sales: up 56% to $1.8 million, representing 14% of total revenues. Annual Medical sales: up 134% to $7.1 million. -- Quarterly recurring reagent disc and HMT reagent revenue of $7.7 million, a 27% increase over the same period last year. -- Quarterly total reagent disc sales of 647,000 units, resulting in the seventh consecutive quarter of record reagent disc sales. -- Quarterly medical reagent disc sales of 68,000 units, a 76% increase over the same period last year. -- Quarterly veterinary reagent disc sales of 579,000 units, a 22% increase over the same period last year. -- Cash and short-term investments as of March 31, 2004: $17.3 million, up 66% year-over-year. Quarterly Results: For the fourth fiscal quarter, ABAXIS reported record revenues of $12.7 million, as compared with revenues of $10.2 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 25 percent. Instrument revenue and reagent disc sales increased by 26 and 27 percent, respectively, during the quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter. The Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $20.9 million, compared to $661,000 for the same period last year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded a one-time income tax benefit of $19.5 million related to existing deferred tax assets (principally net operating loss carryforwards) because it concluded that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, these deferred tax assets had been fully reserved. The $19.5 million income tax benefit, which is partially offset by a current tax provision of $89,000 for the quarter, is included in total net income attributable to common shareholders of $20.9 million. The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.96 (calculated based on 21,861,000 shares) which includes $0.89 per diluted share for the one-time income tax benefit discussed above, compared to $0.04 per share (calculated based on 17,129,000 shares) for the same period last year. Net income for the quarter benefited from the conversion, in October 2003, of Series D and E Preferred Stock into common shares; thereby eliminating the Company's obligation to distribute preferred dividends in the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Twelve Months Results: For the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2004, ABAXIS reported total revenues of $46.9 million as compared with revenues of $34.8 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 35 percent. Net income attributable to common shareholders for the full fiscal year was $23.6 million, compared to $401,000, in the previous fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded a one-time income tax benefit of $19.5 million related to existing deferred tax assets (principally net operating loss carryforwards) because it concluded that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, these deferred tax assets had been fully reserved. The $19.5 million income tax benefit which is partially offset by a current tax provision of $242,000 for the fiscal year, is included in total net income attributable to common shareholders for fiscal 2004 of $23.6 million. The Company reported diluted net income per share of $1.16 (calculated based on 20,387,000 shares) which includes $0.96 per diluted share for the one-time income tax benefit discussed above compared to $0.02 per share (calculated based on 17,012,000 shares) in the previous fiscal year. Net income for the full fiscal year benefited from the conversion, in October 2003, of Series D and E Preferred Stock into common shares; eliminating the Company's obligation to distribute preferred dividends in fiscal 2004. Other Reported Information: Recurring reagent disc and HMT reagent revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $7.7 million, up 27 percent over the $6.1 million reported in the same period last year. During the quarter, the Company sold 647,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs, an increase of 26 percent compared to 513,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year. The Company sold 2,791 veterinary HMT reagent kits during the quarter, up 25 percent compared to 2,228 HMT reagent kits sold for the same period last year. "We are very pleased with the financial results of fiscal year 2004," said Clint Severson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ABAXIS, Inc. "We are particularly proud of reporting record financial results in all four of the quarters this fiscal year. We believe that the strong market for our products combined with the disciplined execution of our strategic business plan are the factors responsible for yielding these record results."

(Nasdaq: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported record financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004. Highlights include: -- Quarterly revenues of $13.2 million, a 28% increase over the same period last year. -- Diluted EPS: $0.07 versus $0.04 in the same period last year. -- U.S. sales of $11.5 million, a 28% increase over the same period last year. -- International sales of $1.7 million, a 27% increase, compared to the same period last year. -- Medical sales: up 39% to $2.2 million, representing 17% of total revenues. -- Quarterly recurring reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue of $8.5 million, a 31% increase over the same period last year. -- Quarterly total reagent disc sales of 701,000 units, a 31% increase over the same period last year. -- Quarterly medical reagent disc sales of 89,000 units, a 62% increase over the same period last year. -- Quarterly veterinary reagent disc sales of 612,000 units, a 28% increase over the same period last year.

The Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.4 million, compared to $659,000 for the same period last year; an increase of 118 percent. Net income for the quarter benefited from the conversion, in October 2003, of Series D and E Preferred Stock into common shares; thereby eliminating the Company's obligation to distribute preferred dividends in the quarter ended June 30, 2004. The Company's effective tax rate in the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was 39% compared to 3% in the same period last year.

The Company ended the quarter with $18.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no long-term debt. Clint Severson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ABAXIS, Inc., said, "The results of the first quarter reflect our continued focus on the execution of our strategic business plan. During the quarter we achieved strong operating results geographically -- domestically up 28 percent and internationally up 27 percent -- and along all product lines, compared to the same period last year. We are especially pleased with the strong increase in medical reagent disc sales on a comparable basis, as well as the continued strength in our flagship veterinary business. We are pleased to be off to a strong start for fiscal year 2005." Mr. Severson continued, "During the quarter the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted CLIA waiver status for our lipids test panel when used in conjunction with the ABAXIS Piccolo point of care analyzer. We are pleased with the recognition that our lipids panel and the Piccolo analyzer deliver high accuracy results from multiple analytes in a point of care setting without the requirement of specialized staff training. Rapid turnaround, accuracy of results and convenience are the hallmarks of ABAXIS technology. We are gratified with this CLIA waiver determination by the F.D.A." Also during the quarter ABAXIS signed an agreement with Henry Schein, Inc. to sell and distribute the ABAXIS VetScan Chemistry and Hematology Systems, along with the associated consumable merchandise. Henry Schein's Veterinary Division serves more than 70 percent of the estimated 24,000 veterinary clinics in the United States.

Reagent disc sales in all of our segments continued to grow at strong double-digit rates. We are particularly pleased with the results of the quarter as we addressed the typical issues associated with the introduction of a new product; in this case our new VetScan HMII hematology analysis system. Additionally, our senior sales management team is commencing a new marketing initiative and study to help us better understand the needs of the medical market and how we might be even more responsive with leading-edge blood analysis solutions.

Exhibit 99.1 ABAXIS ANNOUNCES DISTRIBUTOR CHANGES AND ANTICIPATED IMPACT ON THIRD QUARTER RESULTS UNION CITY, Calif., Dec. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Abaxis, Inc. (Nasdaq: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, announced today that it has terminated its relationship with VEDCO, a warehousing cooperative for member distributors who sell Abaxis products to their respective customers. This action was taken to provide Abaxis with greater visibility to manage its business based on individual distributor sales forecasts, and to offer realistic price incentives based on actual distributor sales volumes. Clint Severson, chairman and CEO of Abaxis, commented, "We want to thank VEDCO for their contributions in helping to build the Abaxis veterinary business. Over the years of working with VEDCO to initiate accountability for consistent performance and growth at the individual member distributor level, it became evident that this was not possible with the current arrangement. Therefore, we decided to terminate our relationship with the cooperative and negotiate agreements with the individual members. Although this action will impact our revenues and net income for the current quarter, we believe that this realignment of our distribution channel is in the best interest of Abaxis going forward." The Company estimates that this one time realignment will account for a revenue shortfall for the current quarter of approximately $1.8 million to $2.1 million, causing total revenues for the quarter to be in the range of $10.5 million to $12.0 million, with earnings in the range of $0.02 to $0.04 per share. Currently, Abaxis has successfully negotiated direct distributor agreements with VEDCO members Merritt Veterinary Supply and Miller Veterinary Supply. Abaxis is currently working with its other U.S. based regional and national distributors, which includes American Veterinary Supply Corp., DVM Resources, Henry Schein, IVESCO, TradeWinds Trading Company, and Western Veterinary Supply to expand their sales and services to support the customers currently served by other VEDCO distributors. The Company will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET Wednesday, December 15, 2004. Participants can dial (877) 356-5706 or (706) 643-0580 to access the conference call, or can listen via a live Internet web cast that can be found at www.abaxis.com.

About Abaxis ABAXIS develops, manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any patient-care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements. The system consists of a compact, 6.9 kilogram, portable analyzer and a series of 8-cm diameter single-use plastic disks, called rotors or reagent discs that contain all the reagents necessary to perform a fixed menu of tests. The system can be operated with minimal training and perform multiple tests on whole blood using either venous or fingerstick samples. The system provides test results in less than 14 minutes with the precision and accuracy equivalent to a clinical laboratory.

Exhibit 99.1 ABAXIS CHANGES SALES AND MARKETING MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE UNION CITY, Calif., Jan. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Abaxis, Inc. (Nasdaq: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, announced changes in its domestic sales and marketing structure and management leadership team with the goal of providing increased management focus in both the veterinarian and medical markets and to accelerate growth. Richard Schoen, VP of Domestic Sales and Marketing for both the veterinary and medical markets is resigning as of January 5, 2005. The Company will divide sales and marketing responsibilities along veterinary and medical market lines and will hire a vice president of sales and marketing for each segment. This new structure will allow enhanced optimization of marketing and sales resources in each segment with the goal of better forecasting capabilities, increased sales and earnings growth. Clint Severson, chairman and CEO of Abaxis, commented, "All of us at Abaxis want to thank Rich for his contributions to Abaxis over the last two years. Over that time domestic sales have grown 53 percent. We wish Rich the best for the future." The Company today announced the promotion of Martin Mulroy to National Director, Veterinary Sales. Mr. Mulroy joined Abaxis in November 1997 as a regional sales manager. In 1999 he was promoted to Eastern Area Sales Director. Reporting to Mr. Mulroy will be four area sales directors and up to twenty-eight regional sales managers. Mr. Mulroy and his team will report directly to Mr. Severson until a veterinary vice president of Sales and Marketing is named. Richard Duncan has been appointed Director of Sales for the Piccolo market. Mr. Duncan previously held the position of Business Development Manager for Urologix of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Prior to Urologix, Mr. Duncan served in various sales and management positions at Physician Sales and Service Corporation from 1993 to 2002, ending as Northern Regional Vice President from 2000 to 2002. Mr. Duncan and his team will report to Abaxis vice president and chief operations officer, Bob Milder, until a medical market vice president of Sales and Marketing is named. The Company also announced that preliminary figures indicate that sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 exceeded the internal sales goal set prior to the beginning of the quarter. Management believes that the transition away from the VEDCO co-op has yielded better than anticipated results during the quarter. The Company expects total revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 to be in the upper range of $10.5 million to $12.0 million.

Exhibit 99.1
          UNION CITY, Calif., Jan. 31 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ABAXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004.
          Highlights for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 include:
          Quarterly Results:  For the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004, ABAXIS reported revenues of $12.1 million, compared with revenues of $12.3 million for the comparable period last year, a decrease of 2 percent.  Recurring reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue increased by $246,000 or 3 percent over the same period last year.  The Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $770,000, compared to $1.1 million for the same period last year; a decrease of 33 percent.  The Company's effective tax rate in the quarter ended December 31, 2004 was 32 percent compared to 7 percent in the same period last year, reflecting the elimination of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in fiscal 2004.  The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.04 (calculated based on 21,550,000 shares), compared to $0.05 per share (calculated based on 21,534,000 shares) for the same period last year.
          Nine Months Results:  For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004, ABAXIS reported total revenues of $38.9 million, compared with revenues of $34.1 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 14 percent.  During the nine-month period, recurring reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue increased by $4.3 million or 21 percent over the same period last year.  Net income attributable to common shareholders for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004 was $3.5 million, as compared to $2.7 million for the same period last year; an increase of 32 percent.  The Company's effective tax rate in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004 was 38 percent compared to 5 percent in the same period last year.  The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.16 (calculated based on 21,726,000 shares), compared to $0.14 per share (calculated based on 19,728,000 shares) for the same period last year.
          Other Reported Information:  Recurring reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was $7.5 million, up 3 percent over the $7.2 million reported in the same period last year.  During the quarter, the Company sold 592,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs compared to 591,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year.  The Company sold 3,728 veterinary hematology reagent kits during the quarter, up 25 percent compared to 2,990 hematology reagent kits sold for the same period last year.  The Company ended the quarter with $21.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no long-term debt.
          Clint Severson, chairman and CEO of ABAXIS, stated, "The results of the quarter and the nine-month period were very negatively affected by the recent realignment of our distribution channel.  In spite of this, we were successful in making up more than $3 million in revenues that would have been lost from the termination of our relationship with VEDCO.  On a year-to-date basis, net revenues are up 14 percent and net income attributable to common shareholders is up 32 percent.  Having met a very formidable challenge in our third fiscal quarter, we are confident that the Company will experience significant long-term benefits from this strategic decision."

ABAX - Q3 2005 ABAXIS INC Earnings Conference Call
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Thank you very much, Joe, and good afternoon to everybody. I will take a few minutes on the call here to review some of the accomplishments, the challenges and some of the goals for next quarter. I will keep my comments brief so we have plenty of time for questions and answers. First, some of the accomplishments. We had excellent performance on in-clinic vet instrument sales in the U.S. with 368 instruments sold in the quarter, up 10 percent or about 34 units year-over-year, and up 18 percent or 57 instruments quarter-over-quarter. This was accomplished with only 17 salespeople who averaged almost 22 instruments per rep.
We had 6 vet sales guys that averaged 28 units and some of the top performers included Gerard who has been with Abaxis just 1 quarter from the Northeast Territories, sold 29 instruments; Dave has been with us for 2 quarters now and he is in the Northwest Territory, he sold 29 instruments; Steve, second-quarter with Abaxis Midwest territory, 28 instruments; Frank, a veteran in the South Central territory with 28 instruments; Bill, second-quarter with Abaxis Southeast territory, 27 instruments; and John, a veteran in the Upper Midwest, with 27 instruments.
Clearly a challenge for the next 6 to 9 months will be to buildout this team to about 28 people with 4 sales areas. The fourth area will be added this quarter and so far this month we have added 4 new vet sales people and so we have a total of 21 going into this quarter. On the Piccolo side of the business we also had excellent performance relative to the number of salespeople. We sold and placed a total of 32 Piccolos in the U.S. versus 23 last quarter and we did it with about half the folks. We started the quarter with 6 salespeople and ended with 3 and the top 2 came in at 11 and 9 Piccolos.
In the U.S. we sold 7 Piccolos in hospitals, 7 in urgent care centers, 12 GP's and FD's, 3 oncology clinics, 1 jail and 2 to cruise lines. 7 of these instruments were sold through GIV and Caligor, units of Henry Schein. 1 unit was placed in a high-volume clinic, 1 was a reagent rental and 23 were direct sales. We now have 4 territories filled and we are recruiting for the other 2. Our goal is to have the 6 territories up and running selling 10 units or more per quarter, and once this is accomplished we will double that team.
Another upside where the Piccolo disks are coming in at just under 115,000 units, up 117 percent year-over-year and up 4 percent quarter-over-quarter. Also total sales for the quarter were higher than our top end estimate even though we are restructuring our U.S. distribution and we eliminated a channel that represented approximately 28 percent of our business Q3 last year and 26 percent last quarter. We hit the top end of our earnings estimates of 4 cents a share, grew the vet business year-over-year, increased the total rotor volume year-over-year despite the distribution changes and increased our cash by over 1 million quarter-over-quarter.
We sold a total of 489 instruments in Q3 05, slightly fewer than the 521 Q3 last year but higher than last quarter sales of 473. We sold 259 VetScans, we sold 180 hematology instruments and 50 Piccolos. We sold 14 Piccolos to the military versus 44 last year and 29 last quarter. We sold 5 Piccolos in the Latin America, Asian territory versus 29 Q3 last year and none last quarter, and we sold 9 Piccolos in Europe versus 9 Q3 last year and 15 last quarter. As I mentioned before 23 Piccolos were sold in the U.S. versus 16 last quarter with half the people. U.S. sales including the military made up 83 percent of total sales while international made up 17. European sales were up about 16 percent year-over-year and total international sales were up about 9 percent.
Due to lower instrument sales U.S. military sales were flat year-over-year and down about 26 percent quarter-over-quarter, however, rotor sales to the military are up 178 percent year-over-year and just under 1 percent quarter-over-quarter. Capital sales made up 34 percent of total sales, consumable made up 66. This is versus 37/63 Q3 last year and 31/69 last quarter. Total rotor sales had about 592,000, were up year-over-year despite the change in distribution. VEDCO rotor sales were at about 226,000 units in Q3 last year and came in at about 68,000 units last quarter. Vet rotors were down about 11 percent year-over-year. Non-VEDCO rotor sales were up 33 percent year-over-year and about 8 percent quarter-over-quarter.
Hematology reagent sales were up 23 percent -- excuse me, 26 percent year-over-year. Gross margins finished at 50 percent, about the same as last year at about the same sales level. The average selling price on the discs at 11.28 is up from 11.16 or about 12 cents over Q3 last year. Disc costs were at record lows for our Union City factory at $4.61, down from $5.08 or about 47 cents versus Q3 last year. Chemistry instrument margins came in in the low 50s and hematology in the mid 30s, due to the high euro and sales promotion activities. Operating expenses were up only 2.6 percent year-over-year and were down 3 percent quarter-over-quarter despite the expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley.
R&D at 1,311,000 was about 11 percent of sales. Sales and marketing 2,566,000 or 21 percent of sales and Admin at 1,151,000 or about 9.5 percent of sales versus about 7 percent of sales in Q3 04, most of that because of the Sarbanes-Oxley expenses. Total expenses as a percent of sales were at 41 percent, a little higher than we expected due to the sales shortfall and of course the expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley. For the 9 months ending 12/04 operating expenses are at about 38.8 percent of sales.
Operating income for the quarter finished at 1,042,000 or about 8.6 percent of sales. For the first 9 months of FY 05 operating income totaled about 5,513,000 or 14 percent of sales versus 9 percent of sales for the same period last year. Operating income for the 9 months ended December 04 is up 75 percent versus the same period last year. For the quarter, net income finished at 4 cents per share fully taxed versus 5 cents per share not fully taxed.

RANSCRIPT
ABAX - Q3 2005 ABAXIS INC Earnings Conference Call
Net income for the first 9 months of FY 05 fully taxed is up 14 percent versus last year's not fully taxed. On the R&D side we completed the development and the launch of our genchem 13. This new panel should help us close Piccolo sales in the European territories and should also drive increased utilization in that part of the world. Challenges include the disruption with the realignment of our distribution in the U.S. vet market. We are also behind in expanding both our vet and medical sales teams. We have made good progress in January with the hiring of 4 new vet reps and 2 new medical reps and we plan to add new vet reps, new vet sales reps, and a new area this quarter and our goal is to have 7 reps in each area within the next 6 to 9 months.
The Lipids Plus panel is somewhat behind schedule due to changes that need to be made to improve performance on some samples. We hope to have this completed and launched this quarter. In addition to meeting aggressive sales and earnings targets, additional goals for Q4 are making sure customers that lost their distributors as a result of the realignment are matched with our current distributors, launching the bile acids test along with the new vet liver panel and the improved Avian-Reptilian panel will be important, completing and launching the Lipids Plus panel for the medical market, getting the wave status submission for ALT, AST and glucose which will allow us to introduce our second wave panel, is critical, and also expanding both our vet and medical sales team and completing our Sarbanes-Oxley project by the end of the quarter. With those remarks I am prepared to answer questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator
(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Ryan Rauch with SunTrust Robinson.
 Ryan Rauch
 - SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
 Just a handful of quick questions. First, can you just maybe walk us through what exactly has happened since your VEDCO termination announcement, the interest level from DVM, Henry Schein and others, and your confidence level that this is behind you and you can see sort of improving vet sales going forward? Can you just kind of walk us through what happened and where you stand today?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 We had approximately somewhere between 1,400 and 1,800 customers. I call them orphan customers. And so what we did was we sent out letters to all of them. In addition to that we gave their names to Henry Schein, DVM and some of our other distributors as well, with an agreement that calls will be made on them within a month to introduce the new distributor and let them know where they can buy their discs. In addition to that we give all of these customers an opportunity to do business directly with us if they prefer to do that, and we set up accounts here. We have been setting up accounts for those customers that prefer that.
So far we are very optimistic that everybody will be picked up. Yes, we should be back to normal within this quarter or certainly within next quarter. I will, however, caution everybody that any time you have disruption in the channel like this, there are risks that you will lose some customers. We will, however, go back and get those customers back if we do lose some. We are confident that (technical difficulty) very well.
 Ryan Rauch
 - SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
 On the medical side, your units were relatively flattish, a little bit down sequentially. How many sales people -- I missed it. Do you have 4 salespeople, I think is what you said? Then we are hearing at least from the military side that January medical unit sales have really picked up nicely based on, unfortunately, what has happened over in Asia in the Tsunami. Is that in fact accurate? Then (b) where you stand with the Navy? Did you see any Navy sales in the December quarter and do you expect any in the next couple of quarters?

RANSCRIPT
ABAX - Q3 2005 ABAXIS INC Earnings Conference Call
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Yes, we had a relatively low military instrument sales number last quarter which is hard to predict those things but normally what happens when we have a low quarter, the next quarter the volume increases. And if you have a really high quarter then the risk is, the next quarter that comes up a number of instruments could go down a little. But we have seen lots of activity on the military and I have not seen a break down of the 14 instruments sold to the military, how many of them went to the Navy. I don't have that with me here now.
But certainly Al can put that together and anybody that is interested is certainly welcome to call him and get that. We are very optimistic about our military business. It is very strong and the rotor sales were strong. While we haven't gotten direct input that the U.S. military is setting up health care for the Tsunami people, we have certainly had indications that they want us on standby in case we have to ship things over there immediately. We are prepared to do that.
 Ryan Rauch
 - SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
 Finally Al, your tax rate was lower in the quarter. Is this what you expect for your fourth fiscal quarter? And then in sort of fiscal 2006, should we start modeling to 32 percent instead of 39, or how should we look at the tax rate going forward?
 Al Santa Ines
 - ABAXIS INC - CFO
 The 32 percent for the quarter is (technical difficulty) low because of the benefits that we have to (indiscernible) the year-to-date tax liability to the government. You can use 38 going forward and the benefits of that reduction of 1% percent is just the resolution or extension of the California R&D credits.
 Ryan Rauch
 - SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
 Finally, Al, on the gross margin line I would expect with the inventory build on the vet side and improving medical sales, we would see a nice bounce back in revenues in the March quarter. Should we assume a corresponding sort of gross margin improvement sequentially as well, if we do in fact see that revenue improvement?
 Al Santa Ines
 - ABAXIS INC - CFO
 Yes, you should actually having $12 million revenues which is actually our bottom line or a low number for the year and increased sales of rotors this quarter should improve the margin line quite a bit.
 Ryan Rauch
 - SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
 Okay, thanks a lot. Have a nice afternoon.

 James Sidoti

 Can you break out the total revenue in terms of product sales and licensing revenue?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Licensing revenue is a very small part of our total sales. Al can break that out but it is probably just a couple hundred thousand dollars.
 James Sidoti
 - Sidoti & CO. - Analyst
 Alright. Can you repeat the number of VetScans and hematology systems sold?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Right. We sold a total of 489 instruments, that is everything, and 259 VetScans, 180 hematology machines and 50 Piccolos.
 James Sidoti
 - Sidoti & CO. - Analyst
 And you brought up the CLIA Waiver for the second panel, do you think that will be a fourth-quarter event?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 We want to get it submitted by the fourth-quarter.
 James Sidoti
 - Sidoti & CO. - Analyst
 So submit this quarter and then 90 days after that, you get a response?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Of course we don't know for sure. We can only state the following, that the first one we did we submitted it in September of 03 and received an okay July 04. Now, I am going to assume the first one is always the hardest because (indiscernible) not aware of your platform or your system, but there is no guarantee it will go any quicker. But again most of our sales right now are to sites that have a CLIA license or are willing to get a CLIA license. It should not slow us down any, but having another CLIA Waiver product, certainly can speed us up.

 As far as your medical sales staff goes, now that you have the new director on board, can you just remind me what are the plans for that? How large do you expect that to get?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Our plan is to I want 6 people selling, averaging about 10 machines per rep per quarter. Once we get to that then we will double the team to 12 and when they get to 10 per quarter, we will double it again. Once we get to a customer base of about 1,000 happy customers and right now we are close to 300, then we will look at adding distribution. Once you add distribution then you have lots of market coverage. The important thing is that you are prepared to handle all of that market coverage and that is what we are doing now.

 Got a pretty good quarter considering it all. With the redistribution of the VEDCO business, I mean you have said that Schein and DVM will pick it up and call all of these guys as quickly as possible, but both Schein and DVM I think had generally better performance than VEDCO. VEDCO was always hassling you in terms of negotiating on how much they would sell or wouldn't sell. Don't you think that kind of coverage from these guys can not only recover the customers you have got, but actually improve the performance of sales there?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Yes, that is one reason we realigned everything to improve the efficiency of our distribution to make sure that all of our distributors get rewarded for the jobs that they do, and the ones that aren't meeting the requirements we are able to counsel them and make decisions then one way or another what the future is. I think the difficulty with the cooperative was you had to treat everybody the same because they are part of a cooperative no matter whether they were performing on not. That got to be very cumbersome and very inefficient and now we have direct deals with two of the VEDCO members, and we are very optimistic that they're going to pull out in front of what the old VEDCO group was doing and do even better.
 Tilton Gardner
 - Brooks Street Securities - Analyst
 What kind of performance contracts are you able to write with these guys? Aren't they improved?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Of course you have a contract that is tied to performance, it is tied to margin. Everybody has a number for instruments and everybody has a number for consumables and that is how it works. If they are at or over their number they make one set of margin, if they are below it they make less margin, below that they make even less margin. We want to make sure that the (technical difficulty) incentive to the people that perform and do a good job.
 Tilton Gardner
 - Brooks Street Securities - Analyst
 Well the history of VEDCO was squeezing you on those margin deals, so how do the contracts work with the new guys?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Of course the contracts were the same. The difficulty you had with working with a cooperative is you might have one member of the cooperative doing very well, deserving (technical difficulty) the high end margin and others members of cooperative (technical difficulty) not meeting their numbers or their requirements, so they would get the low end. But you couldn't discriminate because you're selling through the cooperative. If the cooperative missed the number then you were penalizing the fella that was doing a good job. So that is why we changed it.
 Tilton Gardner
 - Brooks Street Securities - Analyst
 Okay. So just by redistribution you can't project a better sales figure out of these guys?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Of course we have lots of internal forecast here but it is very difficult to be able to predict what is going to happen from one quarter to another quarter. But, yes, we believe so far everybody is doing their job and looks good.

 Last thought, with a lot of these big medical players out there having their own problems of various sorts, aren't there quite a few potential salespeople coming out of those entities?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 I think at Abaxis here Marty Milroy's our new national director of sales, he has been with Abaxis a long time and this is on the vet side. He and his team, Randy and John, are doing a fantastic job and I think I covered the performance early on. We are very good at hiring veterinary sales guys. We know what it takes to be successful out there. And on the medical side we are still learning what the requirements are for a really successful Piccolo sales person, but we're getting better at that all of the time as well. We had 2 people that averaged 10 units per quarter and only 3 people sold 32 units. Of course that was with help from our distributors as well. Yes, we are getting better on all fronts.
 Tilton Gardner

 Could you go over the history of these sales management situation? It seemed that the sales manager for the Piccolo was fired, then Rich Schoen took over that responsibility. Then he resigned. It seems -- I can't get a handle on what's going on in these sales management on the Piccolo.
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Let me try to help. Rich Schoen was Vice President of Sales and Marketing and he was responsible for both the veterinary market and medical market. Below Rich he had hired a director of sales for Piccolo, which is the medical side, and he had 3 areas sales directors for the veterinary side. They all reported up through him. Then he decided (technical difficulty) to make some changes on the sales management side, which he did, and we hired our new sales director now, Rick Duncan, who joined us January 4. He is our new Piccolo Sales Director.
In the meantime I made a decision to separate the veterinary business from the medical business. So rather than having 1 vice president of sales for Abaxis Domestic, I changed it to have 2 vice presidents, 1 for medical and 1 for veterinary. Rich decided to go do something else. So now we are recruiting a vice president of sales and marketing, medical, and vice president of sales and marketing, veterinary. So rather than have just 1 person we will have 2.
 Ron Stevens
 - The Ruby Fund - Analyst
 You don't have either one of those 2 at this time?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 We don't.
 Ron Stevens
 - The Ruby Fund - Analyst
 Who is taking care of the job, you?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Yes, we gave Marty Mulroy an opportunity to move up, so he became Director of the Sales Group for North America, so he got a promotion. And then they report through me. And then Bob Milder, our COO, he is taking the responsibility for the Piccolo side until we fill those jobs.
 Ron Stevens
 - The Ruby Fund - Analyst
 Have you considered the medical sales -- outsourcing the medical sales and getting a partnership situation with some stronger company and concentrating on the sales in the vet?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Yes, here is the equation here. No one has ever successfully launched a point of care blood chemistry machine before. This is something new. No one has ever done it. So there aren't any companies out there that are experts at this. At Abaxis here, we are writing the playbook for this. We are figuring out what is the process to successfully introduce, efficiently sell and efficiently take care of the customers for this new marketplace. Because it is such a very big market potential we want to make sure we know what we are going before we expand too fast, because of course the biggest mistake you could make is expand too fast and not be able to serve the needs of your customers.

ABAX - Q3 2005 ABAXIS INC Earnings Conference Call
We are taking a very disciplined process to this. We went through similar things, learning how to sell in the vet market. So while it may seem slow and difficult we are actually learning pretty quickly and I think the performance of the 3 people that we had on board shows that. Of course the most important part of the business model, from my point of view, is when a Piccolo is sold, we know it is difficult to sell them in the early days, but when it is sold, do they use it? Of course we had very nice Piccolo disc sale increase; I believe it was 117 percent year-over-year. So that part of the model is working. We are figuring it out here and we're making very good progress. In the meantime, Abaxis relative to its size has very strong operating income and very strong cash flow. We are balancing lots of balls in the air at the same time and I think doing a good job at it.

 George Hashburger

 Could you describe for me the update and the process of how you're selling the Piccolo from either a cost benefit analysis or how you are presenting it to the marketplace? I know you have been working on that a little bit and just wondering if there was an update.
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Yes. There are lots reasons why a customer would want a Piccolo and what we are trying to do is identify the ones that have the biggest impact so we can focus our message on just one or two things rather than five or six things. Of course, today my opinion is the reason most of our customers have bought Piccolos, close to 300 of them, is to eliminate the bottleneck of the laboratory. It increases their efficiency, increases patient satisfaction, allows for quicker intervention. There is lots of reasons why eliminating the bottleneck and reducing your cycle time makes a lot of sense.
But there are also other financial reasons for adding a Piccolo as well. Once you add your Piccolo you are the lab, so you collect the margin the lab makes. And of course understanding how much margin that is difficult because it varies so much depending on what plan and that type of thing. We are getting more information on that and trying to get more hard numbers on that as well. But, yes, I think the number one reason today is to reduce the cycle time, increases patient satisfaction and get treatment quicker. Secondary is financial. But we are learning more every day.

 Would you comment on the large percentage increases and inventories and accounts receivable and remind us what source is your deferred revenue?
 Al Santa Ines
 - ABAXIS INC - CFO
 You could see the inventory being large. As you have known, we made the announcement the first week or second week of December on the Vedco termination of the contract. The factory cannot adjust immediately its operations. They have taken it down, but not enough to bring down the inventory. But we are working on those this quarter and the CEO is working on it. As far as the AR is concerned, it is a little bit high and it's natural. When you are terminating a contract, your current customer will be slow paying you. It doesn't mean that they will not pay us. As a matter of fact, they pay us about quite a bit of money, actually, the first week following the close of the quarter. As far as the deferred revenue is concerned, those mostly be the extended warranty that we sell and give away as the normal course of business.

 Is the HM2 supply issue that plague you the last couple of quarters, has that been fully resolved and are you confident and pleased with your new supplier?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Yes, the HM2, we still have a couple of glitches along the way because it is a new product, but the supplier responds really quickly. Yes, it is getting better every month and probably within the next 3 to 6 months it will be as smooth as silk. But we are prepared for the little ups and downs, but nothing like the first quarter that we launched it. Much better than that.

 Do you think the Lipids Plus -- I mean there was a CMS reimbursement change which includes reimbursing for all preventative tests whether or not you have coronary artery disease. Clearly it is a positive for at least a competitor of Cholestech, but do you believe that is a positive for you as well? Does that make the launch of the Lipids Plus panel even that much more important, as this reimbursement just kicked in January 1st.
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 The clinical utility of doing these kinds of tests, routine chemistry tests, diagnostic tests, is actually very high because it can identify problems early on when they can be treated with drugs or lifestyle change or whatever. If they are not picked up and not treated, very expensive intervention has to take place. It is in the interest of the government or other health care providers to make sure that this kind of testing is widely available and encouraged because in the long run, it saves lots of money. I think the change that Medicare made with encouraging screening for glucose and lipids is just a small piece of the pie.
A lot of these other things should be tested more routinely as well. That is good for our business. Of course once intervention takes place in the form of a lifestyle change or a pharmaceutical, then the patient needs to be monitored every 3 to 6 months to make sure the drug is working and there are no side effects. Our Lipids Plus panel is going to be very good for that. We think we are operating in the same interest as providers and of course the government, which is a big payer.
 Ryan Rauch
 - SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
 Okay. Two other quick ones, I guess. Did the share count just increase slightly in the March quarter? It was a little bit lower than what we had thought in December? Two, Clint, how did you do in Japan? I know it has been sort of lumpy there in Japan. Did you see any improvement in the December quarter? Do you expect to see improvement going forward?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Regarding Japan -- Japan is patience. We have about 4 rotors, I believe, or discs that are awaiting approval. And it is just a long process to get approval in Japan. We were over there, I believe it was in November, December and we sat in and listened to the kinds of information they want. We have agreed to provide it and we will continue to do that. Until these new discs or new analytes are approved, it is just difficult to sell machines because you don't have a complete menu. Without a complete menu we know it is difficult to sell capital. The business was about the same as it was the last few quarters and it probably will not change until these approvals take place. We are working with our distributor. We are providing incentives for our (technical difficulty) the regulatory authorities, but over there you just have to have patience and they operate at their own speed. So that is what we're doing.

 On the vet side, how many units were replacement units for a system there and how many were in facilities that didn't have a unit?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Every quarter I used to make an announcement; we had so many competitive trade outs and so many new guys and so many competitive guys, and our sales and marketing team got very upset with me. They said what you are doing is you are encouraging our competitor by giving them the score every quarter and it makes our life difficult because they are on the lookout for us. So please don't do that anymore. I agreed this quarter not to do that.

 Probably weeks away. We have 1 candidate that is going through the process at the home office today.
 Mark Ataliente
 - Alliance Capital - Analyst
 Is the cost benefit analysis on the sale of the Piccolo something that the Company is focused on or is it this lab throughput issue you mentioned, because it would seem in a managed care environment if the doctor could keep the income from the test, that might be a good selling point.
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 It is, it is a very good selling point. So the challenge though is always -- the reimbursement many times differs depending on the different plans. Many times you don't know exactly what the amount of revenue is until the system is installed, they had run it and they have actually billed and collected and those kinds of things. As we build our customer base we will also build our knowledge base and we'll be able to better give predictions; this is what you can expect. Of course, the more hard data you have the easier it is to close the sale because they have hard numbers to work with.
 Mark Ataliente
 - Alliance Capital - Analyst
 So your installed base, are they sharing information with you to show the ability to make money off of the machine? Or how does that work?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Yes, they are. They're sharing information as to what their revenues are on an average per panel.
 Mark Ataliente
 - Alliance Capital - Analyst
 And then you're using that to market the machine?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 And then we will use that so when we have a customer that is evaluating a Piccolo and they want some idea of what to expect we will be able to give them some hard information as to what we have seen out there, yes. Not just estimates.
 Mark Ataliente
 - Alliance Capital - Analyst
 So 3 people were doing the work of 6 it sounds like, if I understand your statement before. What are they doing differently that wasn't being done before, if they are getting the job done and double-digit sales per person?
 Clinton Severson
 - ABAXIS INC - Chairman & CEO
 Of course, one did 11 and one did 9. Of course it is a lot of little things. I think the 2 people -- actually it is 3 people now, are out there are doing all of the things that one has to do to effectively sell a Piccolo and many times it is a numbers game. How many calls are you making? How many demos are you doing? How good you are at getting the information that the physician or the group needs to make their decision. How efficiently do you get the evaluation done? It is individual skills and ambition and work ethic and all those things together.
 Mark Ataliente

We posted record revenues for the year, we achieved an increase of 75 percent in annual medical reagent disc sales, and our veterinary business continued to produce solid growth. With a cash position that exceeds $22 million and no long-term debt, Abaxis is well positioned to leverage its growth potential in the years to come." Mr. Severson continued, "Looking ahead, we expect to bring to the market during this fiscal year medical market rotors that streamline the blood- testing process for coronary disease and cancer treatment. We expect to introduce a Lipid + panel targeting the coronary market and an oncology panel devised specifically for cancer clinics. Additionally, we anticipate submitting three new medical market analytes to the FDA for CLIA-waiver status, which we believe will expand our ability to market the Piccolo to a larger segment of the overall medical market.
"With regards to our veterinary business, we believe there is significant head-room in this market segment and we look to leverage on our marketing strengths and leading-edge technology to expand market share. We will also continue to develop new products that help veterinarians better serve their customers. We look forward to a very productive 2006 fiscal year."

Exhibit 99.1
          UNION CITY, Calif., July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ABAXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005.  Highlights include:
          Quarterly Results:  For the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005, ABAXIS reported revenues of $14.3 million, as compared with revenues of $13.2 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 8 percent. Instrument revenue and recurring reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue increased by $775,000 or 6 percent over the same period last year.  The Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.0 million, compared to $1.4 million for the same period last year.  The Company's effective tax rate in the quarter ended June 30, 2005 was 36 percent, compared to 39 percent for the same period last year.  The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.05 (calculated based on 21,120,000 shares), compared to $0.07 per share (calculated based on 21,901,000 shares) for the same period last year.
          Other Reported Information:  Recurring reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $9.4 million, up 12 percent over the $8.5 million reported in the same period last year.  During the quarter, the Company sold 767,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs compared to 701,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year. The Company sold 3,392 veterinary hematology reagent kits during the quarter, up 14 percent compared to 2,974 hematology reagent kits sold for the same period last year.  The Company ended the quarter with $24.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no long-term debt.
          Clint Severson, chairman and CEO of Abaxis, commented, "We are pleased to report our 11th consecutive profitable quarter.  The veterinary business grew at 14% overall compared to last year's first quarter and our European market grew at a 30% clip during the quarter.  We are very pleased with that development.  In the medical market, revenues from reagent disc sales, excluding sales to the U.S. military, grew by 52% compared to sales in the first quarter of last year.  We are optimistic that the convenience and the reliability of our medical market products will continue to drive higher levels of adoption within the medical community in the coming years."
          Mr. Severson continued, "Challenges for the quarter included lower Piccolo sales to the U.S. Military and an increase in operating expenses.  During this quarter, we invested in both sales and marketing as well as in research and development.  We are expanding our sales force and marketing programs in both the veterinary and medical markets.  The higher investments in research and development resulted in the completion of three new discs, Lipids Plus, Basic Metabolic Panel Plus, and Avian/Reptilian Plus with Bile Acids, and the submission to the FDA of ALT, AST and glucose for CLIA waived status.  The results of this quarter were also impacted by costs attributed to the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance process.  We think these are prudent investments that will provide a superior long term return to shareholders.  We are off to a good start for the fiscal year and we look forward to the opportunities ahead in the next three quarters."

(iv) In connection with the audits of the Company's financial statements for each of the two most recently completed fiscal years and through August 25, 2005, there have been no disagreements with Deloitte & Touche LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte & Touche LLP, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in connection with its audit report.  There were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except that on June 13, 2005, Deloitte & Touche LLP advised the Company's Audit Committee of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to provision for income taxes as described above in (ii) and as disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 5, 2005, in accordance with the recommendation of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), the Board of Directors of Abaxis, Inc. (the "Company") approved full acceleration of unvested stock options with an exercise price of $19.12 or greater previously granted under the Abaxis, Inc. 1998 Stock Option Plan held by Company officers and employees.  Options to purchase approximately 144,810 shares of the Company's common stock, including approximately 126,873 shares held by the Company's named executive officers, are subject to acceleration effective as of December 5, 2005.  The table below sets forth information regarding accelerated options held by the Company's named executive officers:
The Committee also required that, as a condition to the acceleration, each named executive officer agree to refrain from exercising their options until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the option's original terms or, if earlier, the officer's last day of employment or upon a "change in control" as defined in any termination agreement between the individual option holder and the Company.
The decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made to minimize future compensation expense that the Company would recognize in its financial statements with respect to these options as a result of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" (SFAS 123R), which becomes effective for the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2007, commencing on April 1, 2006.  The Company estimates that the aggregate future expense that will be eliminated over the next three fiscal years as a result of the acceleration of the options' vesting schedule is $1,067,000, of which $935,000 is attributable to options held by executive officers.  The Company will report the avoided future expense in its third quarter fiscal 2005 financial statements as a pro forma disclosure in a footnote, as permitted under the transition guidance provided by the Financial Standards Accounting Board.

Exhibit 99.1
[Named Executive Officer] c/o Abaxis, Inc. 3240 Whipple Road Union City, CA 94587
Dear [          ]:
          This letter agreement (this "") is being entered into by and between you and Abaxis, Inc. (the ""), a California corporation, in connection with certain stock options granted to you pursuant to the Company's 1998 Stock Option Plan (subsequently amended and restated to be the "2005 Equity Incentive Plan") that are "Underwater Options," as defined below.
Agreement
Company
          Pursuant to and in accordance with the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined to fully accelerate the vesting of each otherwise unvested stock option held by an option holder employed by the Company as of December 5, 2005 if such option has an exercise price that is greater than or equal to $19.12, a price that exceeds by $2.28 the price of the Company's Common Stock as of the closing of the Nasdaq National Market on December 5, 2005 (each an ""), subject to certain conditions, including (i) that in any case in which such acceleration of vesting would cause the aggregate fair market value of all Company common stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by any individual in the 2005 calendar year (under any equity compensation plan of the Company) to exceed $100,000 (with the fair market value of such stock being determined as of the time the option was granted), such acceleration shall not be effective until such individual executes a letter agreement providing that he agrees and consents to such acceleration and the treatment of any incentive stock options exceeding the annual $100,000 threshold as non-qualified stock options and (ii) that the vesting of any such stock options that are held by any named executive officer of the Company, as that term is defined by Item 402(a)(3) to Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shall not accelerate until such named executive officer executes an agreement pursuant to which he agrees to refrain from selling, transferring, pledging, or otherwise disposing of any shares acquired upon the exercise of options so accelerated until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under such options' pre-acceleration vesting terms or, if earlier, his or her last day of employment or upon a "change of control" as defined in the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan or any other agreement between the individual and the Company.
Underwater Option
          You agree and consent to the acceleration of your Underwater Options and the treatment of any incentive stock options exceeding the annual $100,000 threshold as non-qualified stock options.
          You agree to refrain from selling, transferring, pledging, or otherwise disposing of any shares acquired upon the exercise of your accelerated Underwater Options (other than shares required to cover the exercise price and satisfy withholding taxes) until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under such options' pre-acceleration vesting terms set forth in the option agreement(s) between you and the Company relating to your Underwater Options or, if earlier, your last day of employment or upon a "change of control" as defined in the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan or any other agreement between you and the Company.  You further acknowledge and consent to the placement of a restrictive legend onto any and all share certificate(s) that may be issued upon exercise of Underwater Options prior to the expiration of this Agreement.
          This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one in the same instrument.
          If this Agreement correctly sets forth our agreement on the subject matter hereof, kindly sign and return to the Company the enclosed copy of this Agreement which will then constitute our agreement on this subject.
I acknowledge receipt and agree with the foregoing terms and conditions.

Instrument revenue and recurring reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue increased by $4.7 million or 41 percent over the same period last year.

          Nine Months Results:  For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, ABAXIS reported total revenues of $49.1 million, compared with revenues of $38.9 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 26 percent. During the nine-month period, the Company sold 2.4 million units of reagent discs, up 22 percent compared to the same period last year.  Net income attributable to common shareholders for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005 was $5.2 million, as compared to $3.5 million for the same period last year, an increase of 45 percent.  The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.24 (calculated based on 21,374,000 shares), compared to $0.16 per share (calculated based on 21,726,000 shares) for the same period last year.
          Other Reported Information:  Recurring reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $9.8 million, up 31 percent over the $7.5 million reported in the same period last year.  During the quarter, the Company sold 797,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs compared to 592,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year.

          Clint Severson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ABAXIS, said, "Both markets of our business continued to operate at a high level during the quarter.  Strong instrument sales in both our veterinary and medical markets characterized the quarter.  We sold 671 VetScan and hematology instruments and 105 Piccolo units during the quarter.  In addition to the revenue generated from these sales, our expectation is that our recurring revenue component will continue to grow via increased reagent disc sales in both markets in the quarters to come.  We are particularly pleased that our domestic medical market sales, excluding sales to the military, were up 167%, compared to last year.  We believe this is indicative of the traction that we are beginning to develop in this important market.  Additionally, we were pleased that we experienced an increase in our international business of 33% compared to last year.  The opening of the market in Japan was a major catalyst in driving our international results.  All in all, we are very pleased with the strong performance during the quarter, which marked our 13th consecutive profitable quarter."
          Mr. Severson continued, "We were also very pleased to formalize our Piccolo distribution agreement with PSS World Medical during the quarter.  Of the 105 Piccolo units placed during the quarter, PSS' sales efforts generated the majority of the units placed in medical facilities.  We think this is a great start to our partnership and we look forward to working closely with PSS World Medical in the years to come.  Also during the quarter we completed all of the necessary work to successfully launch the VetScan VS2, the next generation of veterinary blood analysis systems.  The VS2 is equipped with a number of new features that enhance a veterinarian's ability to properly diagnose conditions and determine a treatment regime on a very timely basis in a single visit."

Exhibit 99.1
          UNION CITY, Calif., April 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ABAXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006.
          Highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2006 include:
          Quarterly Results:  For the fourth fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2006, Abaxis reported revenues of $19.8 million, as compared with revenues of $13.8 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 43 percent. Instrument revenue, reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue increased by $5.1 million or 39 percent over the same period last year.  The Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $2.3 million, compared to $1.3 million for the same period last year.  The Company's effective tax rate in the quarter ended March 31, 2006 was 31 percent, compared to 21 percent for the same period last year.  The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.11 (calculated based on 21,721,000 shares), compared to $0.06 per share (calculated based on 21,411,000 shares) for the same period last year.
          Twelve Months Results:  For the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2006, Abaxis reported total revenues of $68.9 million, compared with revenues of $52.8 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 31 percent. During the twelve-month period, the Company sold 3.4 million units of reagent discs, up 28 percent compared to the same period last year.  Net income attributable to common shareholders for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2006 was $7.5 million, as compared to $4.9 million for the same period last year, an increase of 54 percent.  The Company reported diluted net income per share of $0.35 (calculated based on 21,492,000 shares), compared to $0.22 per share (calculated based on 21,662,000 shares) for the same period last year.
          Other Reported Information:  Reagent disc and hematology reagent revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $11.7 million, up 44 percent over the $8.2 million reported in the same period last year.  During the quarter, the Company sold 959,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs compared to 658,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year. The Company ended the quarter with $30.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
          Clint Severson, chairman and CEO of Abaxis, said, "Fiscal year 2006 was characterized by strong operating performance in both our medical and veterinary markets, with revenue increases of 35% and 26% respectively. During fiscal 2006 we commenced transitioning our sales and marketing functions away from direct sales and more toward selected distributors.  This strategic shift was particularly beneficial on the medical side in the United States, with sales to non-military customers increasing by 110%.  On the veterinary side, we introduced our new VetScan VS2, which we believe will help to capture an increasingly larger share of this market going forward.  Our international business grew at a healthy rate posting a 32% increase during the fiscal year. Approximately 68% of our total annual revenues for the year are recurring revenues.  Overall we sold more than 3 million reagent discs during the year and we completed our 14th consecutive profitable quarter.
          Mr. Severson said, "The entire Abaxis team turned in a very strong operational performance in fiscal year 2006.  While we are very pleased with the accomplishments of the past fiscal year, we remain dedicated to expand market share in all of the sectors in which we compete.  With a strong cash position and no long-term debt, we are very well positioned to continue to build on our success in the years to come."
          Abaxis also announced today the promotion of Martin Mulroy to Vice President, Veterinary Sales and Marketing for North America.  Mr. Mulroy first joined Abaxis in November 1997 as Northeast Regional Sales Manager after a 14-year career in point of care in-vitro diagnostics in the medical market, including rapid tests, chemistry, hematology and immunology.

He currently directs a staff of 4 Area Directors and 28 Regional Managers.  Mr. Mulroy holds a Bachelor of Science in Health Policy and Management from Providence College, Providence Rhode Island.
          Clint Severson said, "Marty is a proven asset and committed, key employee. He has broad knowledge of point of care diagnostics, the veterinary marketplace, veterinary sales and marketing, and channel management.  We look forward to his continued contributions and leadership".

Exhibit 99.1 ABAXIS AND HENRY SCHEIN, INC. AGREE TO DISCONTINUE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT ABAXIS EXPECTS MINIMAL FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE QUARTER AND THE YEAR UNION CITY, Calif., May 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ABAXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, announced today that Henry Schein, Inc. and Abaxis have agreed to discontinue their veterinary products distribution agreement effective immediately. Henry Schein distribution of Abaxis veterinary products accounted for approximately 14% of Abaxis' total business in fiscal year 2006. Clint Severson, chairman and CEO of Abaxis commented, "This past March, Henry Schein acquired a regional distributor of a competing company, creating a level of uncertainty in the marketplace. In joint discussions it was determined to be in the best interest of both Abaxis and Henry Schein to dissolve the existing distribution agreement in order to clarify any misunderstanding that might exist in the veterinary market. We are pleased to be able to move forward with our plans to see to it that the Abaxis customer base continues to be served at the highest level." Mr. Severson continued, "We believe that the loss of sales from the Schein organization will be principally offset with increased sales in our other domestic sectors, as well as increased international sales. We expect to meet our internal quarterly and annual financial targets. We were involved in a similar situation in December of 2004 and were successful in keeping Abaxis users appropriately stocked with product in order to keep their veterinary practices operating seamlessly. With a growing distribution network, both domestically and internationally, that is driving increased market acceptance we are better positioned to manage this type of situation and to maintain our quarterly and annual financial goals." Martin Mulroy, Vice President Sales and Marketing for the Veterinary Business, added, "With the recent successful introduction of our new VetScanVS2 analyzer we continue to have the leading-edge product for any veterinary practice. Our existing distribution network is prepared to step right in and service veterinary practices in order to ensure an orderly transition. We are confident in our ability to keep potentially affected end- users stocked and operating at their normal levels. Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our belief that we can continue to gain market share in the veterinary point-of-care blood analysis market. We thank Henry Schein for all of their past efforts." On the veterinary side of the business, Abaxis now has 16 distributor agreements in place in North America, four of which have been added this past year. More than 40% of Abaxis' new business (instrument placements) is now sold direct from the Company, while local distribution typically supplies the consumable component of the Abaxis product line to the end user.

Additionally, the financial condition of the company is very strong with a solid cash position and no long-term debt.  We look forward with great anticipation to the future opportunities ahead of us."

Clint Severson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis, said, "Fiscal 2007 was a very strong year for Abaxis on a number of different fronts. We are particularly pleased that medical sales increased 60% during the year, and for fiscal 2007 represented 20% of total revenues. Medical sales continue to grow in terms of actual dollars and as a percentage of total sales. This is an important growth driver for the business and we believe that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future." "The recurring revenue component of our business, reagent disc sales, continues to grow at a strong annual rate. In fiscal 2007, reagent disc sales, including both medical and veterinary, exceeded 4.1 million units; an increase of 21% over last year. Additionally, during fiscal 2007 we introduced the next generation of blood analysis systems: the VetScan VS2(R) for the veterinary market and the Piccolo xpress(TM) for the medical market." Mr. Severson continued, "During the year we were also granted CLIA-waived status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ten additional analytes for our Piccolo reagent discs. In fiscal 2008, we expect to submit seven new analytes to the FDA for CLIA waiver consideration. We expect that these waivers, if obtained, will have the potential to significantly drive Piccolo system sales in the coming years."

Fiscal 2008 Base Salary and Target Bonus On April 25, 2007, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Abaxis, Inc.

Union City, California
- July 26, 2007 - ABAXIS, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Quarterly highlights include:
Quarterly Results:
For the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007, Abaxis reported revenues of $22.9 million, as compared with revenues of $20.4 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 13 percent. Instrument, reagent disc and hematology reagent revenues increased by $1.9 million, or 10 percent over the same period last year. The company reported net income of $3.1 million, compared to $2.4 million for the same period last year. The companys effective tax rate in the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was 38 percent, compared to 40 percent for the same period last year. The company reported diluted net income per share of $0.14 (calculated based on 22,102,000 shares) in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $0.11 per share (calculated based on 21,758,000 shares) for the same period last year.
Other Reported Information:
Reagent disc and hematology reagent revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $14.3 million, up 18 percent over the $12.1 million reported in the same period last year. During the quarter, the company sold a total of 1,138,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs, an increase of 19 percent, compared to 957,000 medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year. Total medical sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $4.8 million, an increase of 29 percent over last years comparable quarter. Medical sales in North America, excluding sales to the U.S. government, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $3.7 million, an increase of 36 percent over last years comparable quarter. Total veterinary sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $16.4 million, up 6 percent over last years comparable quarter. Additionally, veterinary reagent disc sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $11.0 million, an increase of 19 percent, compared to the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with $49.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
 
 
The first quarter of fiscal 2008 was a quarter of changes and transitions, commented Clint Severson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Despite the challenges that come with change, we were able to achieve record financial results for the quarter. We continue to achieve strong year-over-year sales results in most of our product segments and believe that fiscal 2008 has the potential to continue the strong growth trends of the previous few years. From a strategic standpoint, we are commencing a number of initiatives that we believe will help us take the company to the next level of its development.
In our veterinary business, Mr. Severson continued, we have adjusted the compensation model of our direct sales team to now include sales of reagent discs to customers on an on-going basis. Previously, our sales representatives were tasked with selling our VetScan and VS2 blood analysis instruments only. We have now added reagent disc sales to their compensation package with the goal of improving reagent disc sales going forward, which in turn should expand customer loyalty to our leading-edge systems.
We have also retained a national search firm to bring on a new manufacturing operations executive to succeed Bob Milder, who recently retired. We thank Bob for the significant contributions he made to help bring Abaxis to its current level. We will now look to bring on a seasoned industry professional that can help to drive our next level of growth with the most efficient and effective manufacturing operation possible. We believe that this also represents an exciting opportunity for the next generation of blood analysis products to benefit from the creativity and the fresh perspective of a new operations executive with a unique set of skills and industry expertise.
All in all, concluded Mr. Severson, we are pleased with the progress that we continue to make and we believe that there are a great many market opportunities for our products in the years to come.

The results of the quarter represent the 21st consecutive quarter of profitability. We are achieving real traction in the medical market and we are dedicated to providing the highest level of customer service to our end-user clients. We are particularly pleased with the continued success of our distribution partners in placing 191 Piccolo instruments throughout the medical industry during the quarter compared to 94 in the comparable quarter last year.
Reagent disc unit sales growth of 21% for the quarter of our combined veterinary and medical reagent discs versus the comparable quarter last year is also gratifying. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of disc sales exceeding one million units. We are also gratified with the granting of waived status under CLIA regulations for many of our medical reagent discs. The nine CLIA-waived panels now on the Abaxis menu represents more than 90% of all general chemistries ordered in the United States. Our products provide a wider segment of the medical profession to conduct comprehensive health screenings at the point of care. We believe that the timeliness of achieving lab-accurate results at the point-of-care will result in more efficient care and better patient outcomes.
Mr. Severson concluded, Going forward, we believe that we are well positioned for continued growth. The financial condition of the company is very strong with a growing cash position of $55.8 million, no long-term debt and leading-edge technology. We believe that both the veterinary and medical segments have considerable growth opportunities in the future and we are committed to becoming the leading provider of point-of-care blood analysis systems. We know that there will be future challenges to overcome, but we believe we have the people, products and technology to meet our future goals.

During the quarter, the company sold a total of 1.3 million units of medical and veterinary reagent discs, an increase of 17 percent compared to a total of 1.1 million units of medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year. Total sales in the medical market for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were $6.3 million, an increase of 27 percent over last years comparable quarter. Medical sales in North America, excluding sales to the U.S. government, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were $4.5 million, an increase of 24 percent over last years comparable quarter. Total sales in the veterinary market for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were $18.6 million, up 10 percent over last years comparable quarter.

Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, We are pleased to report revenues of $100.6 million for the fiscal year and our 22nd consecutive profitable quarter. This is an important milestone for Abaxis that signals we have achieved a significant revenue target, in real dollars as well as annual percentage growth, and we are now ready to move the company forward to the next level of its development. I believe this is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all of our employees as well as our distribution partners that have done such a good job in developing the market and getting our products into it.
Mr. Severson continued, During the fiscal year we were able to attain CLIA-waiver status for an additional three medical test panels - bringing to nine the number of CLIA-waiver medical test panels. We can now produce medical test panels that can perform upwards of 90% of all medical (general chemistry) tests typically ordered during routine doctor visits. We currently have new analytes - representing three new medical test panels: critical care; hepatic function; and renal function - under review at the FDA that if waived would broaden the menu of point-of-care tests that physicians can conduct on patients without sending out to centralized labs. We look forward to the opportunities ahead.

Union City, California
- July 24, 2008 - Abaxis, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Quarterly highlights include:
Quarterly Results:
For the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2008, Abaxis reported revenues of $24.6 million, as compared with revenues of $22.9 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 7 percent. Instrument, reagent disc and hematology reagent revenues increased by an aggregate of $1.9 million, or 10 percent over the same period last year. The company reported net income of $2.8 million, compared to $3.1 million for the same period last year. The companys effective tax rate in the first quarter of both fiscal 2008 and 2009 was 38 percent. The company reported diluted net income per share of $0.12 (calculated based on 22,398,000 shares) in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, compared to $0.14 per share (calculated based on 22,102,000 shares) for the same period last year.
Other Reported Information:
Reagent disc and hematology reagent revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $14.9 million, up 4 percent over the $14.3 million reported in the same period last year. During the quarter, the company sold a total of 1.2 million units of
medical and veterinary reagent discs
, an increase of 4 percent compared to a total of 1.1 million units of medical and veterinary reagent discs sold during the same period last year. Medical sales in North America, excluding sales to the U.S. government, during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $4.4 million, an increase of 19 percent over last years comparable quarter. Total sales in the medical market for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $6.5 million, an increase of 36 percent over last years comparable quarter. Total sales in the veterinary market for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $16.6 million, substantially the same as in the comparable period last year. Additionally, veterinary reagent disc sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $10.4 million, a decrease of 6 percent compared to the same period last year.
 
 
 
 
 
The company ended the quarter with $61.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. As of June 30, 2008, the company had a total of $7.0 million in short-term investments and $31.6 million in long-term investments, which long-term investments consisted of investments in auction rate securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes of $1.3 million, are temporary and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, The slow economy did have a negative effect on our veterinary reagent disc business. While the comparisons over the first fiscal quarter last year were difficult due to increased veterinary reagent disc sales because of the pet food scare and the fact we announced a price increase in the last quarter of fiscal 2008, clearly the economy has been a drag on our veterinary consumable sales. The good news is that our Vetscan chemistry analyzer sales increased by 83 units or 25% over last years comparable quarter. Improving product quality and the fact that a Vetscan chemistry analyzer can make a veterinary practice more efficient in a difficult economy are two reasons for the increase.
Mr. Severson continued, Our medical business continues on a strong growth path. In conjunction with our distribution partners, we are seeing enthusiastic acceptance of our products on a nationwide basis throughout the medical community. With our veterinary business poised to resume its more historical sales track, we look forward to improved operating and financial results in the coming quarters.

Abaxis has scheduled a conference call to discuss its results at 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time on July 24, 2008.

However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Restricted Stock Unit Award that the Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a record date prior to the date on which Restricted Stock Units held by such Participant are settled. Such Dividend Equivalents, if any, shall be paid by crediting the Participant with additional whole Restricted Stock Units as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock. The number of additional Restricted Stock Units (rounded to the nearest whole number) to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on such date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Stock Units previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date. Such additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time (or as soon thereafter as practicable) as the Restricted Stock Units originally subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.2, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant's Restricted Stock Unit Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property shall be immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions as are applicable to the Award.
Voting Rights, Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions.
          10.4 Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award and set forth in the Award Agreement,
Effect of Termination of Service.
 
if a Participant's Service terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary (including the Participant's death or disability), then the Participant shall forfeit to the Company any Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Award which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant's termination of Service.
          10.5 The Company shall issue to a Participant on the date on which Restricted Stock Units subject to the Participant's Restricted Stock Unit Award vest or on such other date determined by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement one (1) share of Stock (and/or any other new, substituted or additional securities or other property pursuant to an adjustment described in Section 10.3) for each Restricted Stock Unit then becoming vested or otherwise to be settled on such date, subject to the withholding of applicable taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if permitted by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, the Participant may elect in accordance with terms specified in the Award Agreement to defer receipt of all or any portion of the shares of Stock or other property otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Section.
Settlement of Restricted Stock Unit Awards.
          10.6 Prior to the issuance of shares of Stock in settlement of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Award shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to a Restricted Stock Unit Award granted to a Participant hereunder shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.
Nontransferability of Restricted Stock Unit Awards.

          11.1 This Section 11 shall not be effective unless and until the Committee determines to establish a program pursuant to this Section.

               (b) Participants designated by the Committee who are Insiders or otherwise among a select group of highly compensated Employees may irrevocably elect, prior to a date specified by the Committee, to be granted automatically an Award of Stock Units with respect to such number of shares of Stock and upon such other terms and conditions as established by the Committee in lieu of:
 
                    (i) shares of Stock otherwise issuable to such Participant upon the exercise of an Option;
                    (ii) cash or shares of Stock otherwise issuable to such Participant upon the exercise of an SAR; or
                    (iii) cash or shares of Stock otherwise issuable to such Participant upon the settlement of a Performance Award or Performance Unit.
          11.2 Deferred Compensation Awards granted pursuant to this Section 11 shall be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No such Deferred Compensation Award or purported Deferred Compensation Award shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement.

Terms and Conditions of Deferred Compensation Awards.

However, a Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a record date prior to date on which Stock Units held by such Participant are settled. Such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid by crediting the Participant with additional whole and/or fractional Stock Units as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock. The method of determining the number of additional Stock Units to be so credited shall be specified by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. Such additional Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time (or as soon thereafter as practicable) as the Stock Units originally subject to the Stock Unit Award. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.2, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant's Stock Unit Award so that it represent the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award.
Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions.
                    (ii) A Participant electing to receive an Award of Stock Units pursuant to this Section 11, shall specify at the time of such election a settlement date with respect to such Award.

Any fractional Stock Unit subject to the Stock Unit Award shall be settled by the Company by payment in cash of an amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the payment date of such fractional share.
                    (iii) Prior to their settlement in accordance with the provision of the Plan, no Stock Unit Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to a Stock Unit Award granted to a Participant hereunder shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.

13.
Change in Control

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any unexercisable or unvested portion of each outstanding Award held by a Nonemployee Director or an officer and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof shall be immediately exercisable and vested in full as of the date ten (10) days prior to the date of a Change in Control but conditioned upon the consummation of the Change in Control.
          
13.1 Effect of Change in Control on Options and SARs.
               (a) . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary except as provided in this Section 13, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide in any Award Agreement or, in the event of a Change in Control, may take such actions as it deems appropriate to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability and vesting in connection with such Change in Control of any or all outstanding Options and SARs and shares acquired upon the exercise of such Options and SARs upon such conditions and to such extent as the Committee shall determine.
Accelerated Vesting
               (b) . In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror"), may, without the consent of any Participant, either assume the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Options and SARs or substitute for outstanding Options and SARs substantially equivalent options and SARs (as the case may be) for the Acquiror's stock. Any Options or SARs which are not assumed by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control shall
Assumption or Substitution

               (c) . The Committee may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any Participant, determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, each or any Option or SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control shall be canceled in exchange for a payment with respect to each vested share of Stock subject to such canceled Option or SAR in (i) cash, (ii) stock of the Company or of a corporation or other business entity a party to the Change in Control, or (iii) other property which, in any such case, shall be in an amount having a Fair Market Value equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the consideration to be paid per share of Stock in the Change in Control over the exercise price per share under such Option or SAR (the "Spread"). In the event such determination is made by the Committee, the Spread (reduced by applicable withholding taxes, if any) shall be paid to Participants in respect of their canceled Options and SARs as soon as practicable following the date of the Change in Control.
Cash-Out of Options

Any acceleration of the lapsing of the Restriction Period that was permissible solely by reason of this Section 13.2 and the provisions of such Award Agreement shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Change in Control.
Effect of Change in Control on Restricted Stock Awards
          13.3 . The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award that, in the event of a Change in Control, the Performance Award held by a Participant whose Service has not terminated prior to the Change in Control or whose Service terminated by reason of the Participant's death or Disability shall become payable effective as of the date of the Change in Control to such extent as specified in such Award Agreement.
Effect of Change in Control on Performance Awards
          13.4 .

14.
Compliance with Securities Law

          The grant of Awards and the issuance of shares of Stock pursuant to any Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities and the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Award may be exercised or shares issued pursuant to an Award unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of such exercise or issuance be in effect with respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the Award or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable pursuant to the Award may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to issuance of any Stock, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.
     
15.
Tax Withholding
.
          15.1 The Company shall have the right to deduct from any and all payments made under the Plan, or to require the Participant, through payroll withholding, cash payment or otherwise, including by means of a Cashless Exercise or Net Exercise of an Option, to make adequate provision for, the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to an Award or the shares acquired pursuant thereto. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock, to release shares of Stock from an escrow established pursuant to an Award Agreement, or to make any payment in cash under the Plan until the Participating Company Group's tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant.
Tax Withholding in General.
          15.2 The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable to a Participant upon the exercise or settlement of an Award, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group. The Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.
Withholding in Shares.
     
16.

No
 
amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Award unless expressly provided by the Board or the Committee. In any event, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant unless necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule, including Section 409A of the Code.
     
17.
Miscellaneous Provisions
.
          17.1 Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time the Award is granted. The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company. Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.
Repurchase Rights
.
          17.2 Each Participant shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made available to the Company's common shareholders.
Provision of Information.
          17.3 No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant. Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer on any Participant a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or Director or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the Participant's Service at any time. To the extent that an Employee of a Participating Company other than the Company receives an Award under the Plan, that Award shall in no event be understood or interpreted to mean that the Company is the Employee's employer or that the Employee has an employment relationship with the Company.
Rights as Employee, Consultant or Director.
          17.4 A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in Section 4.2 or another provision of the Plan.
Rights as a Shareholder.
          17.5 The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise or settlement of any Award.
Fractional Shares.
          17.6 . If any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Severability
 
          17.7 Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse. If a Participant dies without an effective designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant's legal representative.
Beneficiary Designation.
          17.8 Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company. Any amounts payable to Participants pursuant to the Plan shall be unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. No Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations. The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder. Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's creditors in any assets of any Participating Company. The Participants shall have no claim against any Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan. Each Participating Company shall be responsible for making benefit payments pursuant to the Plan on behalf of its Participants or for reimbursing the Company for the cost of such payments, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. In the event the respective Participating Company fails to make such payment or reimbursement, a Participant's (or other individual's) sole recourse shall be against the respective Participating Company, and not against the Company. A Participant's acceptance of an Award pursuant to the Plan shall constitute agreement with this provision.
Unfunded Obligation.
          17.9 Except to the extent governed by applicable federal law, the validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law rules.
Choice of Law.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
Effective January 5, 2009, we entered into a License Agreement, or Agreement, with Inverness Medical Switzerland GmbH, or Inverness, pursuant to which we licensed co-exclusively certain worldwide patent rights related to lateral flow technology in the field of animal health diagnostics in the professional marketplace. The Agreement provides that Inverness shall not grant any future rights to any third parties under its current lateral flow patent rights in the animal health diagnostics field in the professional marketplace. The Agreement enables us to develop and market products under rights from Inverness to address animal health and laboratory animal research markets estimated to be over $100 million in the United States.
We paid a $5 million upfront license fee and are required to pay royalties, including annual minimum royalties of $0.5 million to $1.0 million per year over the term of the Agreement, based on sales of products covered by claims under the licensed Inverness patent rights.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop a test or other products based upon or using the licensed patent rights, or that even if we are able to develop products in the field of animal health diagnostics in the professional marketplace, that we will be successful in achieving commercial scale or commercial acceptance in addressing the targeted market.

Item 2.02  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
The information in this Current Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
On January 29, 2009, Abaxis, Inc. announced its financial results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008 and certain other information.  A copy of Abaxis press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement the financial statements presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Abaxis uses non-GAAP measures of operating income per share.  This non-GAAP financial presentation is not a measurement of performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  Management uses this measure in comparing Abaxis operating results with historical performance and believes it provides meaningful and comparable information to management and investors to assist in their review of Abaxis performance relative to prior periods and its competitors.

Appointment of Chief Operations Officer
On April 22, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Abaxis, Inc. (the "Company") appointed Donald Wood as the Company's Chief Operations Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Wood, age 57, has served as the Company's Vice President of Operations since October 2007. From April 2003 to September 2007, Mr. Wood was the Vice President of Operations of Cholestech Corporation (Nasdaq: CTEC), a medical products manufacturing company which was subsequently acquired by Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. in September 2007. From July 2001 to March 2003, Mr. Wood served as Vice President of Bone Health, a business unit of Quidel Corporation, a manufacturing and marketer of point-of-care diagnostics, and was responsible for Bone Health Product Operations, Device Research and Development, and Sales and Marketing. He also served as Quidel's Vice President of Ultrasound Operations from August 1999 to July 2001. Prior to joining Quidel, Mr. Wood was the Director of Ultrasound Operations for Metra Biosystems Inc., a developer and manufacturing company of point-of-care products for osteoporosis, from July 1998 to August 1999 prior to Quidel's acquisition of Metra Biosystems Inc.
Fiscal 2010 Base Salary and Target Bonus
On April 22, 2009, the Board of the Company, after considering the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board, approved the following fiscal 2010 base salaries for the following named executive officers effective April 1, 2009: (i) Clinton H. Severson, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, $360,000; (ii) Alberto R. Santa Ines, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance, $200,000; (iii) Vladimir E. Ostoich, Ph.D., Vice President of Government Affairs and Vice President of Marketing for the Pacific Rim, $210,000; (iv) Kenneth P. Aron, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer, $210,000; and (v) Donald Wood, the new Chief Operations Officer, $200,000. The salaries are the same as for fiscal 2009 with the exception of Donald Wood, who received a $10,000 raise.
On the same date, the Board approved the fiscal 2010 target bonus levels for executive officers. The officers named above will be eligible for a fiscal 2010 bonus with a participation rate as follows: (i) Clinton H. Severson, 146% of base salary; (ii) Alberto R. Santa Ines, 150% of base salary; (iii) Donald Wood, 150% of base salary; (iv) Vladimir E. Ostoich, Ph.D., 143% of base salary; and (v) Kenneth P. Aron, Ph.D., 143% of base salary (each, a "Target Bonus").
A bonus will be earned only if the Company achieves 90% or more of one or more of its pre-established quarterly net sales and/or pre-tax income goals during fiscal 2010. Payment of the Target Bonus, as identified above, is equally weighted at 50% for achievement of the Company's quarterly net sales performance goal and 50% for achievement of the Company's quarterly pre-tax income performance goal. If the Company was to achieve 90% or more, but less than 100%, of only one performance goal, the payout would be limited to 25% of the Target Bonus. The Target Bonus will be earned by named executive officers if at least 100% of both net sales and pre-tax income performance goals are achieved.

Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, While the impact of the weak economy took its toll during the quarter, we are pleased with the overall results for the year and we look forward to fiscal 2010.  Given current economic conditions we are pleased with the solid double-digit (12 percent) annual growth in the recurring revenue component of our business, maintaining solid gross margins and selling more than 5 million reagent discs during the fiscal year, a milestone for the company.  We are also gratified with the initial market acceptance of our recently introduced VetScan Canine Heartworm Rapid Tests.
With regards to the financial condition of the company, Abaxis is in a very strong position with cash and investments approaching $75 million and a balance sheet with no long-term debt.  Our dedication over the years to operating this company on a conservative financial basis has served us well in the past and particularly so during the current global macro-economic downturn.  We believe that as the economy works its way through the recession, Abaxis is well positioned to resume a strong growth trajectory.
An important contributor to that growth trajectory will be the process improvements and product manufacturing quality that have been achieved in the past 18 months across our entire manufacturing platform under the watchful eye of Don Wood, our vice president of operations.  Don has reshaped our manufacturing processes and has focused the energy and innovative spirit of our team to achieve significant efficiencies in the production of leading-edge point-of-care technology.  The Board of Directors have elected to promote Don Wood to the position of Chief Operations Officer, effective April 22, 2009, and he will be an integral part of the executive management team of Abaxis.  We appreciate all of Dons efforts to this point and we expect even greater contributions going forward, concluded Mr. Severson.

Union City, California

Quarterly Results:
  Consumables revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $20.9 million, up 40 percent over the $14.9 million reported for the same period last year.  Total sales in the medical market for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were $5.8 million, a decrease of 12 percent over last years comparable quarter.

Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, This was a very strong quarter for Abaxis.  We achieved substantial revenue and net income growth, strong diagnostic reagent disc sales increases and continued improvement in our cash position and liquidity.  But more importantly, we are gaining real traction in the acceptance of new products that will contribute to our top-line and bottom-line for years to come.  For example, our new VetScan VS Coagulation Analyzer got off to a strong start in its initial roll-out with unit sales representing 12.5% of our total instrument sales in the first quarter.  Our new VetScan Canine Heartworm Rapid Test continues to be received very well by the veterinary community and our distribution agreement with Abbotts Point-of-Care business started in earnest during the quarter with the shipment of i-STAT cartridges.  We expect these products and business relationships will grow and thrive in the coming years.
pro
Mr. Severson continued, During the very challenging economic environment of the past couple of years Abaxis has taken the opportunity to better position the company for the years ahead.  We have been successful in improving the financial underpinnings of the company by conservatively managing and growing our cash position, avoiding taking on debt and achieving operating efficiencies that will meaningfully contribute to our financial results going forward.  Additionally, we have made significant improvements in product engineering, hardware, and software that translate into leading-edge point-of-care technology in both the medical and veterinary markets.  With a strong focus on the future we are successfully moving Abaxis through a very traumatic economic period in a position to prosper as we move into the next market cycle.

 October 27, 2009 - ABAXIS, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today reported financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009.
Union City, California
Record quarterly highlights include:
  For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009, Abaxis reported revenues of $30.3 million, as compared with revenues of $27.7 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 9 percent.

Mr. Severson continued, Our strategic decision to enhance our veterinary product offering with the Canine Heartworm Rapid Test, the VS Coagulation analyzer, and the i-STAT analyzer and their reagent menus is beginning to deliver as all of these new product lines contributed to the top- and bottom-lines during the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe that a significant opportunity to substantially expand our business in the medical market is ahead of us as the economy works its way back to a healthier state.  Abaxis is well-positioned with the right technology, products and people to fully develop this opportunity.

Non-cash compensation expense recognized for share-based awards during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $1.6 million, compared to $443,000 for the same period last year.

Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, Fiscal 2010 was another solid year for Abaxis.  While macro-economic conditions continued to be challenging throughout the year, we achieved double-digit growth in revenues, expanded our installed instrument base in both our veterinary and medical markets and achieved record reagent discs sales.  The fourth quarter was a solid contributor to the results for the fiscal year with strong double-digit growth in sales of all instrument categories as well as reagent discs sales.  During the quarter, we did incur higher costs related to the introduction of new products in veterinary market.  However, we believe that we will benefit in the coming years with a wider palette of products to serve our customers.  All in all, we are very pleased with the financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year.
 
Mr. Severson continued, As we move into the new fiscal year, we are better positioned to operate even more efficiently going forward.  Throughout fiscal 2010, we took a number of important steps to improve on the quality of our offerings and to support our customers at a world-class level.  We believe that the instruments we produce today are the most accurate and reliable in the history of the company.  Our customers, across all medical and veterinary practices, now benefit from the advanced engineering that is the hallmark of all Abaxis products, and they are better served by a sales, marketing and customer support regime that is second to none in the industry.  We look forward to continue to grow our business and serve our customers in 2010 and beyond.

We also achieved strong growth in consumables sales of 21% for the quarter.  We are very pleased with the traction that we are gaining across our various markets.  A strong focus on more effective sales and marketing efforts across all of our platforms has driven those gains.
Mr. Severson continued, We are also very pleased that our razor/razorblade model continues to deliver outstanding results; 72% of our quarterly revenues are recurring and we believe that there is still headroom to drive this percentage higher in the coming years.  In that regard, we believe that the substantial increase in the number of medical instruments placed in urgent care centers and in the internal medicine markets during the quarter will be solid contributors to our recurring revenue model.  Additionally, we are dedicated to a strong and consistent research and development process to introduce new products that effectively diagnose conditions in both the veterinary and medical markets and that provide an additional cash flow stream to the medical professionals that rely on Abaxis technology.  We also look forward to entering into the rapid testing market by taking full advantage of the lateral flow technology that we licensed.  We believe there are exciting growth opportunities ahead in the coming years.

Other Reported Information:
Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, We are very pleased with the results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2011.  Revenues and net income were up 16% and 12%, respectively, compared to last years third quarter.  We experienced strong double-digit growth in all product categories.  Total medical market sales were up 57% compared to last years third quarter.  Piccolo units sold into the medical market, excluding sales to the U.S. government, increased 35% with medical reagent discs units sold, growing by 48%.  In the veterinary market, total sales grew by 10% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
Mr. Severson continued, We were particularly pleased with the progress made during the quarter in selling Piccolo instruments into the internal medicine, urgent care and family practice market segments.  We believe that physician acceptance of point-of-care diagnostic testing is increasing as they come to more broadly appreciate the efficacy of treating their patients in a more timely manner, as well as the operational efficiencies rendered to their practices.  As we seek to continue to penetrate these markets in the coming years and as these physicians integrate these instruments more fully into their everyday operations, the recurring revenue segment of our business will become an even larger contributor to our bottom line results.  We believe this bodes well for Abaxis in the future.

Item 1.01           Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 26, 2011, Abaxis, Inc. (the Company) entered into a Master Technical Testing Services Agreement with the Kansas State University and K-State Diagnostic and Analytical Services, Inc. or KDAS/VDL.  Pursuant to this agreement, KDAS/VDL, which is affiliated with Kansas State University, will perform certain diagnostic services at the Companys request on a fee-for-services basis.  The Company intends to offer these diagnostic services, along with other diagnostic and laboratory services, to clients as part of the Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratory, or AVRL, being established by the Company.  The initial term of the agreement is five years and may be extended for additional periods if the parties desire to do so.  The Company has the right to terminate the agreement at any time on advance written notice, and Kansas State University and KDAS/VDL have a limited right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances.
In connection with the Master Technical Testing Services Agreement, the Company also entered into a Master Agreement with two entities affiliated with Kansas State University, the National Institute for Strategic Technology Acquisition and Commercialization, or NISTAC, and the Kansas State University Research Foundation, or KSURF.  Pursuant to the Master Agreement, the Company has issued to NISTAC warrants to purchase 10,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share, and will be obligated to issue additional warrants to purchase 20,000 shares of the Companys common stock with an exercise price of $3.00 per share on the date the Company first receives samples from a paying customer for which the KDAS/VDL could have performed one or more of the veterinary diagnostic and laboratory testing and related services contemplated by the Master Technical Testing Services Agreement.  Each warrant vests at a rate of 20% annually from its issuance date and has a term of five years.  In addition, under the Master Agreement, the Company will pay royalties on AVRL sales to KSURF for ten years.  If the Master Technical Testing Services Agreement expires or is terminated early, the royalty obligations will continue for the full ten year period, but at a reduced rate.

For the fiscal year 2011, medical market sales increased 20% and veterinary market sales were up 17% year-over-year.  Coupled with strong operational and financial performance throughout the year across all our major product lines, we closed fiscal year 2011 on a very positive note setting the stage for the coming year.
Mr. Severson continued, Looking ahead, we are making a strategic investment in developing our centralized veterinary laboratory operation in conjunction with Kansas State University.  We believe that this will enable us to successfully leverage the Abaxis brand and the reputation of Kansas State University with veterinarians across the country as the centralized laboratory of choice to achieve consistent and definitive testing services that will help them to improve outcomes within their patient populations.  We also believe this is a model that will set the stage for further expansion in the years to come.

Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, The first quarter of the fiscal year is best characterized as a period of investment for future growth.  Our operating expenses increased by approximately $2.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, due to our strategic investments in our upcoming Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories (AVRL), scheduled to be fully operational this year, research and development for future new products for both the medical and veterinary markets, sales and marketing to continue building brand awareness, and protecting our intellectual property.  We believe these investments will provide substantial growth potential in the years to come.  While top-line revenues for the quarter were up three percent versus the comparable quarter last year, our North American business grew at a seven percent clip.  For the quarter, our international business was down 12 percent, primarily attributable to timing issues in the booking of certain orders through distributors.  We expect the bulk of those orders to be recognized in the near future.  We sold a total of 1.6 million reagent disc units across all product lines during the quarter; which is the third highest quarter in reagent disc unit sales in the history of the company.
Mr. Severson continued, As we have previously disclosed, legal expenses associated with the on-going intellectual property infringement case impacted the results of the quarter.  As a company founded on innovation, and one that continues to be a leader in new technologies, we believe that infringement of our intellectual property is something we must take very seriously.We are pleased that the financial underpinnings of the company remain very strong as evidenced by solid profitability for the quarter and an increase in our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $10.5 million to $108.9 million compared to the same period last year.  As we move forward, we expect that fiscal year 2012 will continue the trajectory of growth set in recent years.

This was a very solid quarter for Abaxis, commented Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis.  We achieved record revenues for the quarter exceeding $40.0 million, total instrument sales in units grew 24%, total reagent disc sales increased 18%, and we experienced solid international sales growth, approaching 40%.  We were particularly pleased with the growth in sales in Europe and Asia; which we believe bodes well for the future.  Our markets, by and large, appear to be very strong at the moment.  While we still have work to do in accelerating medical instrument sales, we are confident in the accuracy and reliability of our Piccolo medical instrument and of our ability to gain market share going forward.  We are very pleased with the results of the second quarter.
Mr. Severson continued, On another front, in our second quarter of fiscal 2012, AVRL went live with our partners at Kansas State University.  We have completed the bulk of the initial investment to get this venture operational and we look forward to serving the veterinary community nationwide with our leading-edge technology and customer service.  Over the past 16 years we have built a high level of credibility with the segment of the veterinary community that relies on our point-of-care instruments to compassionately care for their patients on a timely basis.  We believe that this community will give AVRL the opportunity to earn their reference laboratory business.  Our expectation is to leverage that credibility and develop a consistently growing business in the years to come.
We are also devoted to enhancing the market capitalization of the company for the benefit of our loyal shareholders.  The Board has authorized us to acquire up to $40.0 million of Abaxis common stock in the open market.  In our second quarter of fiscal 2012, we acquired approximately 1.2 million shares in the open market for approximately $27.3 million.  We believe this is a sound investment and we will take the opportunity to support our shareholders in the future when we believe the price is appropriate.  We are very upbeat about the prospects of the company in the coming years.

Total sales in the medical market for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $8.1 million, which were flat, compared to the same period last year. Medical sales worldwide, excluding sales to the U.S. government, during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $7.5 million, an increase of 15 percent, compared to the same period last year. Total sales in the veterinary market for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $28.5 million, an increase of 8 percent, compared to the same period last year.

Abaxis Board of Directors has approved a $15.0 million increase to its existing share repurchase program, to a total of $55.0 million.
Other Reported Information:
Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, Veterinary market revenues for the quarter increased 8% despite the lingering economic slowdown in our European markets and distributor inventory adjustment due to the establishment of our own warehouse near Frankfurt to provide distributors with support in a more timely manner. We expect to see a more stable business environment in our European markets in the coming quarters. Although we clearly faced various challenging conditions in the third fiscal quarter, we continued to grow total revenues at a rate of 5% compared to the same quarter last year. Medical market reagent disc unit sales during the quarter were a record of 655,000 units, up 14% versus the comparable quarter last year. We believe this is a reliable indication that we are developing a solid position in this critical market and we are doing it on a consistent basis.
We continue to make strategic investments for the future growth of our business, continued Mr. Severson. We are in the process of adding to our sales force, both in the U.S. and Europe, to develop expanded market share in those markets. We are continuing to invest in our new Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories (AVRL) to position it as the leading outsourced laboratory provider featuring tighter test turnarounds, superior customer service, and cost efficiencies not available at the AVRLs competitors. We believe this is an important business segment with the potential of significant returns in the coming years.

Other Reported Information:
Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, We are very pleased with the operational and financial results of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.  We achieved at a very high level and set records across the board on a number of critical metrics including revenues and instrument and reagent disc sales.  For the fourth quarter we achieved double-digit total revenue increases, driven in large part by strong increases in North American revenues.  Unit sales of medical and veterinary instruments increased 22%, which in turn drove a 25% increase in medical and veterinary instrument revenues for the quarter.  These are all record levels for the company.
On the expense side of the ledger, we continue to make investments in expanding our direct sales and marketing capabilities as well as maintaining our commitment to research and development in improving our existing product lines and developing new products for the future.  We remain committed to the successful operation of our Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories (AVRL), as they become more fully established and able to support operations from their internal cash flow.  Additionally, we have established a new distribution center in Europe, allowing us to better serve our customers.  These investments had an impact on the amount we were able to bring to the bottom line for the full 2012 fiscal year, and position us for continued strong growth in the years ahead.
Mr. Severson concluded, The results of the year are a testament to the focus and dedication of the entire Abaxis team.  Although global economic conditions continue to pose challenges on a day-to-day basis, our team continues to execute at the highest levels and produce record results.  As a result of this focus on execution, consumables sales, the recurring component of our revenue stream, now stands at 73% of total revenues which is an all-time high for Abaxis.  This is a strong validation of our business model and bodes well for the future.  Clearly, we closed fiscal year 2012 on a strong note, but more importantly, we have set the stage for continued growth in the coming years.  A key contributor to this growth and an integral part of the executive management team at Abaxis, has been Martin Mulroy, Vice President of Animal Health Sales and Marketing, since May 2006.  I am pleased to announce the Board of Directors have approved the promotion of Martin to Chief Commercial Officer effective April 25, 2012.  I would like to congratulate Martin on his new position and we expect even greater contributions going forward.

Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, commented, We achieved solid performance in the first quarter, highlighted by a 17% increase in revenues compared to last fiscal years comparable quarter.  We had solid double-digit growth across virtually all product categories, as well as geographic markets.  Compared to last fiscal years comparable quarter, medical market revenues were up 18%; veterinary market revenues were up 17%; and total medical and veterinary market instruments revenues were up 31%.  Geographically, North America revenues were up 12% and international revenues were up 41%, driven by improved performance in Europe.  The financial underpinnings of the business continue to be very strong with approximately $98.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. All in all, it was a very solid quarter.
During the quarter, Mr. Severson continued, we were particularly pleased with our medical diagnostics business, which received initial orders for Piccolo Xpress units to support a four-year worldwide drug clinical trial.  In the past year we have been actively working with leading clinical research organizations (CROs) and biotechnology companies to incorporate real-time testing into drug clinical trials.  We believe that our point-of-care diagnostic testing is ideally suited for real-time monitoring to insure study participant safety and to drive cost efficiencies in the clinical trials process.  We believe that the drug clinical trials market represents an important new market for Abaxis and we will continue to work diligently to more fully develop this new opportunity.

On August 28, 2012, Abaxis, Inc. (the Company) received a letter from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Office of the Nasdaq Stock Market determining that the Company failed to comply with Listing Rule 5635(c) that listed companies obtain stockholder approval for material amendments to an equity compensation plan.
 
The Company maintains its 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, originally approved by shareholders in October 2005 and subsequently amended by the Company and approved by shareholders in October 2008 and October 2010 (the Plan), under which it may make awards of restricted stock units and other equity-based awards.  The Plan contains a provision that no more than 500,000 shares may be granted under the plan upon exercise or settlement of full value awards, which include restricted stock units.  In connection with the preparation of the proxy statement for the Companys 2012 annual meeting of shareholders, the Company determined that it issued more shares in settlement of restricted stock units than are currently permitted under the full value award limit.  As of August 28, 2012, the Company had issued 870,179 shares of Common Stock upon settlement of restricted stock units granted under the Plan since October 2005.  The Company inadvertently exceeded the full value award limit because it believed that such limit applied to each 500,000-share increase to the overall share reserve increase approved by stockholders in 2005, 2008 and 2010.   The Company has not issued restricted stock units and other equity awards or shares issuable upon exercise or settlement thereof in excess of the overall share reserve for the Plan approved by shareholders.
 
The Company promptly reported the foregoing to the Listing Qualifications Office of the Nasdaq Stock Market and its proposed plan to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5635(c) to the Listing Qualifications Office of Nasdaq on August 22, 2012.  On August 28, 2012, the Listing Qualification Officer provided a letter to the Company (a) concurring in the Companys view that the issuance of shares in settlement of restricted stock units in excess of the full value award limit caused the Company to fail to satisfy the shareholder approval requirement of Listing Rule 5635(c), and (b) agreeing to the Companys proposed remediation plan of amending the Plan to eliminate the full value award limit and seeking shareholder approval for such amendment at its 2012 annual shareholders meeting.

In the medical market, excluding sales to the U.S. government, Piccolo unit sales were up 86%, and in the veterinary market, veterinary units sold increased 24%, when compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2012.  We continue to expand the base of instruments in the field which sets the stage for increased consumables sales in the coming years.  We are also gratified with the addition of MWI Veterinary Supply (MWI) to our veterinary distribution channel.  MWI is a leading provider of veterinary supplies nationwide and we expect that they will develop a new universe of customers for our VetScan products and consumables.
Mr. Severson concluded, We will continue to invest our capital into R&D to develop new rapid tests, reagent test panels and improve manufacturing efficiencies to drive future sales and enhance margins.  At the completion of the quarter the underlying financial condition of the company remains very strong with over $100.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and investments.  We look forward to a continuation of our progress in the second half of the year.

On October 26, 2012, Abaxis, Inc. (the Company) entered into an Exclusive Agreement (the Agreement) with Abbott Point of Care Inc. (Abbott) to take effect on January 2, 2013.  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company granted to Abbott the exclusive right to sell and distribute in the U.S. and China (including Hong Kong) the Companys Piccolo Xpress chemistry analyzer and associated consumables in the professionally attended human healthcare market, but excluding sales and distribution to a certain specified customer and specified customer segments in the Abbott territories.   In particular, Abaxis will retain the distribution rights to current customer, Catapult Health LLC, and certain market segments, including pharmacy and retail store clinics, shopping malls, contract research organizations (CROs) and cruise ship lines.
Abbotts exclusive right to sell and distribute these products under the Agreement is subject to certain annual minimum purchase and sales requirements.  In the event Abbott fails to achieve such minimum requirements, the Company may either convert Abbotts status to a non-exclusive distributor or terminate the Agreement.  The initial term of the Agreement ends on December 31, 2017, and after the initial term, the Agreement renews automatically for successive one-year periods unless terminated by either party based upon a notice of non-renewal six months prior to the then current expiration date.  In the event the Company elects to give notice of non-renewal after the initial term, the Company will pay to Abbott a specified one-time termination fee.  If at any time after January 1, 2014 there is a change of control of the Company, and the Company (or its successor) elects to terminate the Agreement, then Abbott will be paid a one-time termination fee based on Abbotts volume of sales in the final contract year.
 
Under the Agreement, Abbott will be exclusively responsible for marketing and promoting the Piccolo Xpress products in the specified territory other than to the customer and customer segments retained by the Company, and the Company will have certain responsibilities for providing technical support and warranty services to Abbott in support of those marketing and sales efforts.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Abaxis Announces Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Abbott
 October 31, 2012 - Abaxis, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ABAX), a medical products company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis systems, today announced the Company has signed an exclusive multi-year distribution agreement with Abbott's Point of Care business to market and distribute the Piccolo Xpress, a portable clinical chemistry system and its full line of one-time use reagent discs to the human medical market.
Union City, California
Under terms of the agreement, Abbott will have the exclusive right to distribute and sell in the U.S. and China (including Hong Kong) Abaxis Piccolo Xpress chemistry analyzer and associated consumables in the professionally attended human healthcare market. Abaxis will retain the distribution rights to current customer, Catapult Health and certain segments including pharmacy and retail store clinics, shopping malls, contract research organizations (CROs), and cruise ship lines. Abaxis will provide technical support and warranty services to support Abbotts commercial efforts.
Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, said, We are extremely pleased to have formed a strategic partnership with Abbott to sell and distribute our Piccolo Xpress instruments and our reagents discs. This agreement with Abbott dramatically expands our reach across the broad spectrum of healthcare institutions and medical practitioners throughout the U.S. and provides the opportunity to enter the China market.  We believe this agreement validates the technology of our innovative products to produce lab-accurate comprehensive test results in minutes, reduce medical expenses and improve patient outcomes. We expect that this partnership will allow us to grow our medical sales, and look forward to a successful collaboration with Abbott in the years to come.
In light of this distribution agreement, Abaxis will reorganize its North American medical sales and marketing organization. Mr. Brenton Hanlon, former Vice President of North American Medical Sales and Marketing, has left the Company, effective October 29, 2012 to pursue other opportunities.
I would also like to extend my appreciation to Brenton Hanlon and his team for the work done in widening the recognition of our Piccolo line of products and the benefits that it provides for medical practitioners and institutions throughout the U.S., continued Mr. Severson. We wish Brenton the best in his future endeavors.

Overall we achieved record quarterly reagent disc sales and instrument sales increased at solid double digit rates compared to third quarter of fiscal 2012.  We are particularly pleased and encouraged with the development of our working relationships with our two new distributors, Abbott Point of Care, Inc. and MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc.  These new distribution channels give us entry into markets to which we previously had very little access and expand the universe into which we can embed Abaxis technology.  While we are still in the early stages of working together, we are developing the necessary chemistry between our respective organizations that will ensure long-term success.
We are also pleased with the progress achieved in the international markets during the quarter, continued Mr. Severson.  Sales in both Europe and Asia continued to improve and grew at a 33% rate compared to last years third quarter.  Although macroeconomic conditions throughout the world continue to be challenging, our dedication to building these markets during these most difficult times is beginning to bear real fruit.  All in all, we had a very solid quarter and we look to finish the year on a strong note in both our veterinary and medical markets.

Other Reported Information:
Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, said, We are pleased with the operating results achieved in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013.  Instrument sales across the board, including both the veterinary and the medical markets, were up 31 percent for the year.  Reagent disc unit sales for the year were up 11 percent to a record 7.5 million units.  Additionally, we are gratified that the ten-year compounded annual growth rate in our total reagent disc unit sales is greater than 15 percent.  Sales in North America and internationally were up 18 percent and 20 percent, respectively.  One of the key strengths of the company is our higher margin consumable sales, which increased 16 percent in the fourth quarter and represented 72 percent of total fourth quarter revenue.  We remain firmly focused on maximizing this core component of our business which constitutes our recurring revenue stream.
Fiscal year 2013 marks the 12th consecutive year of profitability for Abaxis.  Given the challenging global macroeconomic conditions of the past five years, we are extremely proud of our ability to operate effectively and profitably in uncertain times, continued Mr. Severson.  The financial underpinnings of the company are very strong.  We maintain a solid cash position, which provides us a level of stability during these difficult times.  During fiscal year 2013, we paid a special one-time dividend to our loyal shareholders.  Looking ahead, we are excited about our strategic initiatives and the opportunities with our new distributors, Abbott Point of Care, Inc. for medical products and MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. for animal health products.  Our expectation is that as the medical market distribution channel becomes more developed in the coming quarters, medical market products will also become consistent double-digit growers.  We are excited with the possibilities ahead.

About Abaxis
Abaxis develops, manufactures, markets and sells portable blood analysis systems for use in any veterinary or human patient-care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements.  The system consists of a compact, 5.1 kilogram (11.2 pounds), portable analyzer and a series of single-use plastic discs, called reagent discs that contain all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to 13 tests on veterinary patients and 14 tests on human patients.

(the Company) approved the following fiscal 2014 base salaries for its executive officers effective July 1, 2013, including the following base salaries for the Companys named executive officers: (i) Clinton H. Severson, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, $485,000; (ii) Alberto R. Santa Ines, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance, $260,000; (iii) Vladimir E. Ostoich, Ph.D., Vice President of Government Affairs and Vice President of Marketing for the Pacific Rim, $260,000; (iv) Kenneth P. Aron, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer, $260,000; and (v) Donald P. Wood, Chief Operations Officer, $260,000.
On the same date, the Committee approved and the Board ratified the fiscal 2014 target bonus levels for its executive officers. The named executive officers named above will be eligible for a fiscal 2014 bonus with a participation rate as follows: (i) Clinton H. Severson, 139.2% of base salary; (ii) Alberto R. Santa Ines, 144.2% of base salary; (iii) Vladimir E. Ostoich, Ph.D., 144.2% of base salary; (iv) Kenneth P. Aron, Ph.D., 144.2% of base salary; and (v) Donald P. Wood, 144.2% of base salary (each, a Target Bonus).
Bonus payouts will be based on the companys achievement of quarterly net sales, pre-tax earnings and of specified operational goals. A bonus will be earned only if (a) the Company achieves 90% or more of its pre-established quarterly goal for either net sales or pre-tax earnings and (b) specified operational goals. Payment of each quarterly bonus is equally weighted at 50% for achievement of the Companys quarterly net sales performance goal and 50% for achievement of the Companys quarterly pre-tax earnings performance goal, in both cases subject to satisfaction of the specified operational target.
If the Company was to achieve 90% or more, but less than 100%, of only one performance goal, the payout would be limited to 25% of the Target Bonus. The Target Bonus will be earned by named executive officers if at least 100% of both net sales and pre-tax earnings performance goals are achieved. The maximum bonus payout is capped at 200% of the Target Bonus, provided the Company achieves greater than 133% of at least one of its two performance goals. If earned, a bonus payment will be paid quarterly at a rate of 15% for first quarter, 25% the second and third quarters, and 35% for the fourth quarter.

FY2014 Performance RSU Grants and FY2013 Performance RSU Cancellations
Effective April 29, 2013, consistent with the Committees long-standing practice of making annual restricted stock unit (RSU) grants to its executive officers, the Committee granted RSUs to acquire shares of the Companys common stock to its executive officers. Certain of these RSUs contain performance-based vesting criteria (FY2014 Performance RSUs). The FY2014 Performance RSUs vest only if both of the following criteria are satisfied: (1) the Companys consolidated income from operations for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014, as certified by the Committee, is in excess of the applicable target amount set forth in the table below; and (2) the recipient remains in the Service of the Company (as defined in the Companys 2005 Equity Incentive Plan) until the applicable vesting date set forth below:
The FY2014 Performance RSUs are subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in the grant notice and restricted stock unit agreement for such grants and the Companys 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. The FY2014 Performance RSUs granted to the named executive officers of the Company are as follows: (i) Clinton H. Severson, 36,000 shares; (ii) Alberto R. Santa Ines, 16,000 shares; (iii) Vladimir E. Ostoich, Ph.D., 16,000 shares; (iv) Kenneth P. Aron, Ph.D., 16,000 shares; and (v) Donald P. Wood, 16,000 shares.
Effective as of April 30, 2012, the Companys executive officers were granted RSUs, certain of which contained performance-based vesting criteria (the FY2013 Performance RSUs). The FY2013 Performance RSUs were subject to vesting in four equal annual increments based on the Companys consolidated income from operations for each of the years ending March 31, 2013 through 2016 exceeded 90% of the target for such year, respectively. On April 29, 2013, 25% of the shares subject to the FY2013 Performance RSUs were issued as a result of the Company exceeding 90% of its consolidated income from operations target for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013. In consideration of the grant of the FY2014 Performance RSUs described above, each executive officer of the Company has agreed to cancel the remaining portion of the FY2013 Performance RSUs. The number of shares issued upon vesting of the FY2013 Performance RSUs and the number of shares subject to the portion of each of the FY2013 Performance RSUs that has been cancelled are as follows: (i) Clinton H. Severson, 5,750 shares issued and 17,250 shares cancelled; (ii) Alberto R. Santa Ines, 2,625 shares issued and 7,875 shares cancelled; (iii) Vladimir E. Ostoich, Ph.D. , 2,625 shares issued and 7,875 shares cancelled; (iv) Kenneth P. Aron, Ph.D. , 2,625 shares issued and 7,875 shares cancelled; and (v) Donald P. Wood, 2,625 shares issued and 7,875 shares cancelled.
