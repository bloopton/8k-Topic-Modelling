EXHIBIT 99.1
Aaron Rents, Inc. Confirms Earnings Guidance For First Quarter; Will Merge Some Sight & Sound Stores
        ATLANTA, April 7, 2003Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the rental, sales and lease ownership, and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced that revenues and earnings were on plan for the first quarter of 2003.
        "Our earnings for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of, or to slightly exceed, our previous guidance of $.38 to $.40 per diluted share," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents, Inc. "The first quarter results are the result of the growth in revenues and earnings in our Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores. We continue to expect to earn between $1.55 and $1.65 per diluted share for the full year of 2003."
        The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its store count during the first quarter by 20 stores, 13 Company-operated stores and eight franchised stores, bringing the total of stores open at March 31 to 665. At the end of March the Company also had 70 rent-to-rent stores open.
        "Although our sales and lease ownership business is exceeding expectations, the retail sales performance of our Sight & Sound stores remains disappointing. During the second quarter we will convert a number of our Sight & Sound stores to traditional Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, or close them and transfer the store's lease volume to an existing Aaron's store," Mr. Loudermilk added. "We still believe that offering the lease transaction in a traditional retail store has excellent potential and we are encouraged by the lease volume we have been building in the Sight & Sound stores. The retail sales environment, however, has been very difficult and we feel we can more effectively conduct this experiment with a lesser number of stores."
        The Company will announce its first quarter results for 2003 on April 28.
        Aaron Rents, Inc., based in Atlanta, currently has 735 Company-operated and franchised stores across the United States and Puerto Rico for the rental and sale of residential and office furniture, accessories, consumer electronics and household appliances. The Company also manufactures furniture, bedding and accessories at 10 facilities in four states.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (a) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired: None. (b) Pro Forma Financial Information: None. (c) Exhibits: ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE Pursuant to Exchange Act Release 47583, Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") is furnishing the following information and Exhibit pursuant to Items 9 and 12 of Form 8-K. On April 28, 2003, the Company issued a press release to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The press release presents the Company's systemwide revenues, along with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, which the Company determined to be Company revenues, and a reconciliation of Company revenues to systemwide revenues. Systemwide revenues is calculated by adding Company revenues as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to the revenues of the Company's franchisees, and subtracting the Company's royalty revenues from the resulting total. [The Company calculates franchisee revenues by dividing a royalty rate of 5% into the Company's royalty revenues.] Franchisee revenues however are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures such as systemwide revenues is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare the overall growth and penetration of the Aaron Rents brand in a more meaningful manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because systemwide revenues are not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, systemwide revenues as used in the press release may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Items 9 and 12 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACT: GILBERT L. DANIELSON Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER REVENUES AND EARNINGS ATLANTA, April 28, 2003 - Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the first quarter of 2003. The Company's results were driven by its fast-growing Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division, which increased revenues 31% during the quarter including a 14.1% increase in same store revenues. "Our Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division continues to perform very well," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents, Inc. "The first quarter results were better than anticipated and we look forward to continuing growth the remainder of the year." For the three months ended March 31, 2003 revenues advanced 22% to a record $191.3 million compared to $156.7 million for the first quarter of 2002. Net earnings for the first quarter increased 48% to a record $8.7 million, or $.40 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $5.9 million, or $.29 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Systemwide revenues for the Company, which includes gross revenues of franchised stores, advanced 21% to $259.5 million for the quarter versus $215.3 million a year ago. Systemwide revenues is calculated by adding Company revenues determined in accordance with GAAP of $191.3 million to the revenues of the Company's franchisees of $71.8 million, and subtracting the Company's royalty revenues of $3.6 million. Franchisee revenues however are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Same store revenues (revenues earned in stores operated for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 14.1% during the first quarter of 2003 compared to first quarter of 2002. Same store revenues increased 6.6% for stores open over two years in both the first quarter of 2003 and 2002.
The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its store count during the first quarter by 21 stores, 13 Company-operated stores and eight franchised stores, bringing the total of stores open at March 31 to 665. At the end of March the Company also had 70 rent-to-rent stores open. During the first quarter the Company's Sight & Sound stores negatively affected earnings by approximately $.06 per diluted share. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company converted six of the 25 Sight & Sound stores to traditional Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores. In addition, seven other Sight & Sound stores will be closed with the store's lease volume transferred to nearby existing Aaron's stores. With the reduction in stores open, the Company expects the negative financial impact from the Sight & Sound stores to diminish in future quarters. "Our outlook for 2003 is recording revenues during the year in the range from $730 million to $750 million with systemwide revenues exceeding $1 billion," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "We expect diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $.38 to $.40 per share, and continue to expect to earn between $1.55 and $1.65 per diluted share for the full year of 2003." Systemwide revenues is calculated by adding Company revenues determined in accordance with GAAP of $730 million to over $750 million to the revenues of the Company's franchisees of $263 million to over $284 million, and subtracting the Company's royalty revenues of $13.2 million to over $14.2 million. Franchisee revenues however are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Tuesday, April 29, 2003, at 10:00 am Eastern time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through our website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

Exhibit 99.1 Same Store Revenues Up 11.3%; Earnings Up 31%; Announces More Acquisitions ATLANTA, July 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the rental, sales and lease ownership, and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the second quarter and first half of 2003. The Company's major division, Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership, increased revenues 25% for the second quarter and 28% for the first half of the year. The division's same store revenue growth for the second quarter was 11.3%. "We continue to meet our performance expectations," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents, Inc. "The growth within the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division has been exceptional and we see further strong results in upcoming quarters." For the three months ended June 30, revenues increased 18% to a record $177.7 million compared to $151.2 million for the second quarter of 2002. Net earnings for the second quarter this year increased 31% to $8.8 million versus $6.7 million last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $.40 compared to $.32 per share for the second quarter a year ago. For the first six months of this year, revenues advanced 20% to a record $369.0 million compared to $307.8 million for the first half of 2002.

For the six-month period systemwide revenues were $502.4 million, up 19% from the $423.3 million last year. Systemwide revenues is a non-GAAP financial measurement calculated by adding Company revenues determined in accordance with GAAP to the revenues of the Company's franchisees and subtracting the Company's royalty revenues. Franchisee revenues, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. A schedule reconciling Company revenues to systemwide revenues appears below. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores opened for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 11.3% during the second quarter of 2003. Same store revenues increased 6.0% for stores open over two years in both the second quarter of 2003 and 2002.

A schedule reconciling Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership revenues to the division's systemwide revenues also appears below. The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its store count during the second quarter by 21 stores, 12 Company-operated stores and nine franchised stores, bringing the total of stores open at June 30 to 686. At the end of June the Company also had 66 rent-to-rent stores open The Company's Sight & Sound stores, acquired in 2002, negatively affected earnings in the second quarter by approximately $.04 per diluted share and $.11 per diluted share for the first six months of the year. Currently the Company is operating 12 Sight & Sound stores. On July 2 the Company announced the purchase of 37 rental stores in three different transactions. Of the 37 stores acquired, 19 have become new Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores with the remaining 18 stores merged into existing Aaron's locations. In addition, ten more rental stores in Ohio were purchased as of today from Showplace, Inc. The Company will merge five of these stores into existing Aaron's locations. All of the acquisitions were asset purchases for cash. "We continue to actively look for opportunistic acquisitions to compliment the opening of our Company-operated and franchised stores," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "In addition to seeking the acquisition of independent rental stores, we also anticipate purchasing up to 50 of our better performing franchise stores within the next several months, assuming there are willing sellers. All franchise store acquisitions are expected to be accretive to earnings." A 3-for-2 stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend on both Common Stock (RNT) and Class A Common Stock (RNT.A) was announced by the Company on July 21. New shares will be distributed on August 15, 2003 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 1, 2003. The accompanying table presents the second quarter results as if the split occurred prior to this date. "We are revising our guidance for 2003, expecting revenues during the year in excess of $750 million with systemwide revenues exceeding $1 billion," Mr. Loudermilk added. "We plan to aggressively open stores, opening at least 30 Company-operated and 50 franchised Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores during the current year. On a pre-split basis for the third quarter of 2003 we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.38 to $.40 per share with earnings per share for the full 2003 year in a range of $1.60 to $1.65 per diluted share. Our initial outlook for 2004 is achieving diluted earnings per share, on a pre-split basis, between $1.85 to $1.95. We are obviously very positive on the future for the Company." Estimated 2003 systemwide revenues includes the Company's estimated revenues, other than approximately $14 million to $15 million in royalties, plus anticipated revenues of franchisees of approximately $265 million to over $285 million. Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, July 30, 2003, at 10:00 am Eastern Time.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (a) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired: None. (b) Pro Forma Financial Information: None. (c) Exhibits: Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Aaron Rents, Inc. press release dated October 28, 2003, announcing the Company's financial results for the third quarter of 2003 (furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K). ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On October 28, 2003, Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release to announce its financial results for the third quarter of 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The press release presents the Company's systemwide revenues, along with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, which the Company determined to be Company revenues, and a reconciliation of Company revenues to systemwide revenues. Comparable information is given for the Company's Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division. Non-GAAP systemwide revenues is calculated by adding Company or division revenues determined in accordance with GAAP to the revenues of the Company's franchisees and subtracting the Company's royalty revenues. Franchisee revenues, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures such as systemwide revenues is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare the overall growth and penetration of the Aaron's brand in a more meaningful manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because systemwide revenues is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, systemwide revenues as used in the press release may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Item 12 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1 Aaron Rents, Inc. Reports Record Results For Third Quarter; Same Store Revenues Up 9.8%; Earnings Up 29% ATLANTA, Oct. 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the rental, sales and lease ownership, and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2003. For the three months ended September 30, revenues increased 19% to $188.4 million compared to $157.8 million for the third quarter a year ago. Net earnings increased 29% to $8.7 million versus $6.7 million for the third quarter 2002. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $.26 compared to $.20 per share last year. For the first nine months of this year, revenues increased 20% to $557.4 million compared to $465.7 million for the same period of 2002. Net earnings for the nine months were $26.2 million versus $19.3 million for the comparable period last year, a 35% increase. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months were $.79 for 2003 compared to $.61 in 2002. "We are very pleased with these record results in both revenues and earnings," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "Our Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division continues to drive our performance, growing rapidly in both revenues and earnings from both new and existing stores. We are confident this growth will continue during the remainder of 2003 and on into 2004." Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores) in the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division for stores open for at least fifteen months at the end of September 2003 increased 9.8% for the third quarter of 2003 compared to the third quarter a year ago. Same store revenues increased 8.2% between the same periods for stores open for at least two years at the end of September 2003. Non-GAAP systemwide revenues for the Company, which includes gross revenues of franchised stores, advanced 18% to $254.4 million for the quarter versus $216.5 million a year ago. For the nine-month period non-GAAP systemwide revenues were $756.8 million, up 18% from $639.8 million for the first nine months of last year. The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its third quarter revenues 26% to $161.2 million versus $128.3 million last year. Systemwide revenues for this division rose 22% to $227.2 million for the third quarter versus $186.9 million a year ago. Sales and lease ownership revenues for the first nine months of 2003 increased 27% to $473.4 million compared to $371.7 million last year, and systemwide revenues for the division advanced 23% to $672.9 million compared to $545.8 million for the first nine months of last year. Non-GAAP systemwide revenues are calculated by adding GAAP revenues to the revenues of the Company's franchisees and subtracting the Company's royalty revenues. Franchisee revenues, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. A table reconciling Company revenues to systemwide revenues and Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership revenues to the division's systemwide revenues follows below. The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its store count during the third quarter by a net 39 stores. During the quarter the Company purchased 65 stores, including 20 franchise stores, in seven separate cash transactions. Of the 45 non-franchise stores acquired, 22 were kept open, with the rental contracts of the other 23 stores merged into existing Aaron's stores. In addition, during the quarter three new Company-operated stores were opened and 14 new franchise stores were added. Subsequent to September 30 the Company acquired an additional three franchise stores. At September 30 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division had 482 Company-operated stores and 243 franchise stores open. In addition, the Company had 64 rent-to-rent stores. During the first nine months of 2003 the Company has opened 35 new franchise stores and awarded an additional 26 stores for future opening. At the end of September there were 198 franchise stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years. "Our guidance for 2003 remains unchanged, with revenues for the year expected to be in excess of $750 million and systemwide revenues expected to exceed $1 billion," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the fourth quarter of 2003 we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.29 to $.31 per share with diluted earnings per share for the full 2003 year in a range of $1.08 to $1.10 per diluted share. For 2004 we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.25 to $1.30. Our goal is to increase our combined Company-operated and franchise store base over the next several years in excess of 10% per year." Estimated 2003 systemwide revenues includes the Company's estimated revenues, other than approximately $14 million to $15 million in royalties, plus anticipated revenues of franchisees of approximately $265 million to over $285 million.

(c) Exhibits: Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Aaron Rents, Inc. press release dated February 24, 2003, announcing the Company's financial results for 2003 (furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K). ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On February 24, 2003, Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release to announce its financial results for 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The press release presents the Company's systemwide revenues, along with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, which the Company determined to be Company revenues, and a reconciliation of Company revenues to systemwide revenues. Comparable information is given for the Company's Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division. Non-GAAP systemwide revenues is calculated by adding Company or division revenues determined in accordance with GAAP to the revenues of the Company's franchisees and subtracting the Company's royalty revenues. Franchisee revenues, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures such as systemwide revenues is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare the overall growth and penetration of the Aaron's brand in a more meaningful manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because systemwide revenues is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, systemwide revenues as used in the press release may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Exhibit 99.1 Aaron Rents, Inc. Reports Record Revenues and Earnings for Fourth Quarter and Year ATLANTA, Feb. 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the rental, sales and lease ownership, and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and the year 2003. For the three months ended December 31, revenues increased 20% to $209.4 million compared to $175.0 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Net earnings increased to $10.3 million versus $8.1 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.31 compared to $.25 per share last year. For the year, revenues advanced 20% to $766.8 million compared to $640.7 million for the same period of 2002, and net earnings were up 33% for the year to $36.4 million versus $27.4 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $1.10 for 2003 compared to $.86 per share last year. Non-GAAP systemwide revenues for the Company, which includes gross revenues of franchised stores, advanced 18% to $1.0 billion for the year. A table reconciling Company revenues to systemwide revenues is presented below. "We are quite pleased that, as expected, our systemwide revenues exceeded the $1 billion milestone in 2003 and that Company revenues and earnings for both the fourth quarter and year were record performances," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents, Inc. "In 2004 we will continue to expand the Company's store base, opening both Company-operated and franchised Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, and supplementing that growth with selective acquisitions. With our proven Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership business model, strong customer demand and increasing market potential, we feel future growth prospects for the Company are excellent." The Company's Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased revenues for the quarter 24% to $183.0 million. Non-GAAP systemwide revenues for the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division rose 21% to $250.1 million compared to $207.2 million for the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year, Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership revenues increased 26% to $656.5 million versus $519.0 million last year, and systemwide revenues in the division advanced 23% to $923.0 million compared to $753.0 million for 2002. The division's same store revenues from Company-operated stores open in comparable periods (excluding Sight & Sound stores) grew 10.6% in the fourth quarter. The Company's Sight & Sound stores, acquired in 2002, negatively affected earnings in the fourth quarter by approximately $.02 per diluted share and $.12 per diluted share for the year. The 11 Sight & Sound stores now open are not expected to be significantly dilutive to earnings in 2004. During the fourth quarter, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its store count by 62 stores, 18 Company-operated stores and 44 franchised stores. Also, during the fourth quarter the Company awarded area development agreements to various independent operators to open 86 new Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchise stores. For 2003 as a whole the Company awarded area development agreements for the opening of 112 more franchise stores. At the end of December there were 241 franchise stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years. At December 31, 2003 the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division had 500 Company-operated and 287 franchise stores open. In addition, the Company had 60 rent-to-rent stores in operation. "Our 2004 guidance remains unchanged at this time. We plan to add approximately 140 new stores in 2004, a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores, and will also continue to look for acquisition opportunities. For the first quarter of 2004 we expect revenues to be over $220 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.32 to $.34 per share," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "We expect Company revenues to exceed $900 million (excluding revenues of franchisees) for the full year of 2004 with diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.37 to $1.42, which includes an anticipated $.10 per diluted share gain on the sale of the Company's 8% interest in Rainbow Rentals Inc." Rent-A-Center Inc. has recently announced it has reached an agreement to acquire Rainbow Rentals with closing anticipated in the second quarter of 2004. Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly and full year financial results on Wednesday, February 25, 2004, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen to the call by webcast accessible through our website, www.aaronrents.com , in the "Investor Relations" section.

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On April 26, 2004, Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2004. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. On April 27, 2004 the Company held a conference call to discuss the results of the quarter with investors and analysts. During the course of this call, management disclosed that earnings before income taxes for the Company's rent-to-rent business segment were approximately $2.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, and that this represented an increase of over 20% from the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Management attributed this increase to an improving economy and actions taken by the Company to win competitors' customers. Finally, management disclosed that the internal goal for the rent-to-rent segment's earnings before income taxes is $8 million for 2004. The press release presents the Company's systemwide revenues, along with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, which the Company determined to be Company revenues, and a reconciliation of Company revenues to systemwide revenues.

"For the second quarter of 2004 we expect revenues to be over $225 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.44 to $.46 per share, which includes an anticipated $.10 per diluted share gain on the disposition of our Rainbow Rentals stock in Rainbow Rentals' proposed merger with Rent-A-Center," Mr. Loudermilk continued.

For the three months ended June 30, 2004 revenues advanced 30% to $230.3 million compared to $177.7 million for the second quarter of 2003. Net earnings for the second quarter increased 76% to $15.4 million, or $.46 per diluted share, compared to $8.8 million, or $.26 per diluted share, for the same period last year. The Company's other revenues include a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million, or $.10 per diluted share, realized in the second quarter resulting from the disposition of its Rainbow Rentals, Inc. stock when Rainbow merged with Rent- A-Center, Inc. in May. For the first six months of this year, revenues advanced 28% to a record $472.8 million compared to $369.0 million for the first half of 2003. Net earnings for the six months were $28.2 million versus $17.5 million for the corresponding period last year, up 61%. Diluted earnings per share for the first half were $.84 for 2004 and $.53 for 2003. Included in the Company's other revenues is royalty income from franchisees, which in 2004 increased to $4.1 million for the second quarter from $3.4 million for the quarter a year ago and to $8.3 million for the first six months compared to $7.0 million for the same period last year. In addition, non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to franchisees, increased to $35.3 million for the second quarter from $24.9 million for the quarter a year ago and to $81.8 million for the first six months compared to $56.4 million for the same period last year. The increases in royalty income and non-retail sales are attributable to an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $88.7 million during the second quarter and $172.0 million for the first six months of 2004, a 29% and 22% increase from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Revenues of the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 32% for the quarter to $198.3 million versus $150.3 million in the second quarter of last year. First half sales and lease ownership revenues also increased 32% to $412.9 million compared to $312.2 million a year ago. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 14.7% during the second quarter of 2004 compared to second quarter of 2003. Same store revenues increased 12.0% for stores open over two years at the end of June 2004. During the second quarter the Company awarded area development agreements to various independent operators to open 31 new Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchise stores. Through the first six months of 2004, agreements have been signed for 84 additional new franchise stores. At the end of June there were 281 franchise stores awarded that are scheduled to open over the next several years. The Company acquired 26 stores during the second quarter, including two franchise stores, and contracts and related merchandise of four additional stores. Also, during the second quarter, the Company converted ten of its 11 remaining Sight & Sound stores to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores. Including these acquisitions and one Sight & Sound store closure, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its store count during the second quarter by 54 stores, comprising of 42 Company-operated stores and 12 franchised stores, bringing the total number of stores open at June 30 to 884. At the end of June the Company also had 60 rent-to-rent stores open. A 3-for-2 stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend on both Common Stock (RNT) and Class A Common Stock (RNT.A) was announced by the Company on July 12. New shares will be distributed on August 16, 2004 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 2, 2004. The accompanying table presents the second quarter results as if the split occurred prior to this date. "For the third quarter of 2004 we expect revenues to be over $225 million and diluted earnings per share, on a pre-split basis, to be in the range of $.32 to $.34 per share," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "We are increasing our guidance for the full year of 2004, again expecting Company revenues to exceed $950 million (excluding revenues of franchisees), more than a 24% increase over 2003, with diluted earnings per share, on a pre-split basis, in the range of $1.50 to $1.54, compared to the $1.10 diluted per share recorded in 2003. Our previous earnings guidance for the 2004 year was between $1.48 and $1.53 per diluted share. Our new store opening plans for 2004 are to open approximately 140 new stores, a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores, in addition to adding between 40 and 50 Company-operated stores during the year through acquisition. Our initial outlook for 2005 is to continue to increase our Company-operated and franchise store base in excess of 15% annually and achieve diluted earnings per share, on a pre-split basis, in the range of $1.70 to $1.80."

Exhibit 99.1 Aaron Rents, Inc. Reports Results for Third Quarter; Revenues and Earnings Up 23%; Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership Same Store Revenues Up 10.9% ATLANTA, Oct. 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2004. For the three months ended September 30, 2004 revenues increased 23% to $231.6 million compared to $188.4 million for the third quarter of 2003. Net earnings for the third quarter also increased 23% to $10.6 million versus $8.7 million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $.21 compared to $.17 per share last year. For the first nine months of this year, revenues increased 26% to $704.4 million compared to $557.4 million for the same period of 2003. Net earnings for the nine months were $38.8 million versus $26.2 million for the same period a year ago, a 48% increase. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months were $.77 for 2004 compared to $.53 in 2003. "Once again we have delivered outstanding results consistent with past results and expectations," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "Our Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division continues to outperform all its competitors. We expect our rapid expansion and the resulting increase in market penetration to continue in upcoming periods." Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 10.9% during the third quarter of 2004 compared to the third quarter of 2003. Same store revenues also increased 7.4% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of September 2004. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to franchisees, increased to $36.8 million for the third quarter from $25.5 million for the quarter a year ago and to $118.6 million for the first nine months compared to $81.9 million for the same period last year. Also, included in the Company's other revenues is royalty income from franchisees, which in 2004 increased to $4.5 million for the third quarter from $3.5 million for the quarter a year ago and to $12.8 million for the first nine months compared to $10.5 million for the nine month period last year. The increases in non-retail sales and royalty income are attributable to an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $89.3 million during the third quarter and $261.5 million for the nine months of 2004, 30% and 25% increases from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Also included in other revenues for the first nine months is a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million, or $.07 per diluted share, realized in the second quarter resulting from the previously announced disposition of the Company's Rainbow Rentals, Inc. stock when Rainbow merged with Rent-A-Center, Inc. in May. For the third quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues 27% to $204.3 million compared to $161.2 million last year, and for the first nine months revenues were $617.2 million, a 30% increase over the $473.4 million recorded a year ago. During third quarter the Company awarded area development agreements to open an additional 65 franchised stores. For the first nine months of this year 146 additional franchised stores have been awarded to existing and new franchise operators. At the end of September there were 314 franchised stores in the pipeline scheduled to open over the next several years. Also, during the quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 14 new Company-operated stores and 22 new franchised stores. For the first nine months of the year a net of 85 Company-operated and 56 franchised sales and lease ownership stores have been added, including the opening of 43 new Company-operated stores and 55 new franchised stores. At September 30 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division operated 585 Company-operated stores and 343 franchised stores. In addition, the Company had 59 rent-to-rent stores for a total of 987 stores, an increase of 17% in store count from the 847 stores open at the end of December 2003. "Our guidance for 2004 remains unchanged, expecting Company revenues to exceed $950 million for the year (excluding revenues of franchisees)," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the fourth quarter of 2004 we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.23 to $.26 per share with diluted earnings per share for the full 2004 year in a range of $1.00 to $1.03. Our guidance for 2005 is also unchanged, anticipating Company revenues in excess of $1.1 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.13 to $1.20. Our continuing goal is to increase our combined Company-operated and franchised store base over the next several years in excess of 15% per year." Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Friday, October 29, 2004, at 11:00 am Eastern Time.

Exhibit 99.1 AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS REVENUES FOR FOURTH QUARTER; SAME STORE REVENUES UP 8.0%; EARNINGS UP 34% FOR QUARTER; 44% FOR YEAR ATLANTA, Feb. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2004. For the three months ended December 31, revenues increased 16% to $242.1 million compared to $209.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. Net earnings increased 34% to $13.8 million versus $10.3 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.27 for the quarter compared to $.20 per share for the comparable period last year. For the year, revenues increased 23% to $946.5 million compared to $766.8 million for 2003. Net earnings for 2004 were $52.6 million versus $36.4 million for 2003, a 44% increase. Diluted earnings per share were $1.04 for 2004 compared to $.73 in 2003. "We are obviously pleased with these results," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "This is the best year in the Company's history, now in its 50th year. We plan to continue to aggressively expand our Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership business in 2005." For the fourth quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues 17% to $214.0 million compared to $183.0 million last year. For the twelve months, the division's revenues were $831.1 million, a 27% increase over the $656.5 million recorded for 2003. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 8.0% during the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Same store revenues for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of December 2004 also increased 4.9% between those quarters. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to franchisees, increased to $42.2 million for the fourth quarter from $38.4 million for the quarter a year ago and to $160.8 million for the year compared to $120.4 million for 2003. Royalty income from franchisees, which is included in the Company's other revenues, increased to $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 from $3.5 million for the quarter a year ago, and to $17.8 million for the year compared to $14.0 million for last year. The increases in non-retail sales and royalty income are attributable to an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $97.2 million during the fourth quarter and $358.7 million for fiscal 2004, 36% and 28% increases from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Included in the operating results for the fourth quarter 2004 was an approximate $750,000 net credit, or $.01 per diluted share, due to a reduction in the Company's accrual for future personal property tax liabilities offset by additional expense relating to advertising. Also included in other revenues for 2004 is a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million, or $.07 per diluted share, realized in the second quarter from the previously announced disposition of the Company's Rainbow Rentals, Inc. stock when Rainbow Rentals merged with Rent-A-Center, Inc. in May, 2004.
During the fourth quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 25 new Company-operated stores and 24 new franchised stores. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired nine stores from one of its franchisees, acquired two stores from an independent rental operator, and acquired the accounts from three other third party stores. For 2004, a net of 186 sales and lease ownership stores were added, an over 23% increase for the year in store count, including the opening of 68 new Company-operated stores and 79 new franchised stores. During the year the Company awarded area development agreements to open 160 additional franchised stores. At the end of December there were 301 franchise stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years. At December 31 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division operated 616 Company-operated stores and its franchisees operated 357 stores. In addition, the Company had 58 rent-to-rent stores. "Our guidance for the first quarter of 2005 is to expect revenues in excess of $270 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.29 to $.32," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the entire 2005 year we continue to expect Company revenues in excess of $1.1 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.13 to $1.20. We plan to increase our store count between 15% and 20% per year for the next several years." Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Thursday, February 24, 2005, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com , in the "Investor Relations" section.

On the Vesting Date, Grantee shall own the Shares of Restricted Stock free and clear of all restrictions imposed by this Agreement (except those imposed by Section 3.4 below).  The Company shall deliver a certificate(s) for the Shares of Restricted Stock to Grantee as soon as practical after the Vesting Date.

On the date of the Change in Control, the Company shall deliver to Grantee a certificate(s) for the Restricted Stock, free and clear of any restrictions imposed by this Agreement.

While in its possession, the Company reserves the right to place a legend on the stock certificate(s) restricting the transferability of such certificates and referring to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture) of this Agreement and the Plan.

The Grantee shall be responsible for all federal, state and local income taxes payable with respect to this award of Restricted Stock.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On April 27, 2005, Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2005. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. This press release presents earnings per share ("EPS") information excluding a gain from the 2004 sale of the Company's holdings of Rainbow Rentals, Inc. stock, and provides reconciling information to EPS measures including the gain. Management believes that presentation of EPS measures excluding the gain is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare the Company's core operating results from ongoing operations from period to period in a more meaningful and consistent manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K. ITEM 9.01.

Exhibit 99.1 [ ]+ GEO ED1 FC1 IRW TNW RWB PFM (AARON RENTS, INC. 004063 AT) 1151 g...ra CLW004 /FROM PR NEWSWIRE CLEVELAND 216-566-7777/ >% [STK] RNT [IN] REA OFP HOU CSE [SU] ERN CCA MAV TO BUSINESS AND RETAILING EDITORS: AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER REVENUES AND EARNINGS; SAME STORE REVENUES UP 8.3%; EARNINGS UP 44%; RAISES FORECAST FOR YEAR ATLANTA, April 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the first quarter of 2005. For the three months ended March 31, revenues increased 15% to $279.3 million compared to $242.5 million for the first quarter in 2004. Net earnings increased 44% to $18.4 million versus $12.8 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.36 compared to $.26 per share last year. "These results exceeded our expectations and are a great start to what we feel will be another record year for the Company," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "All aspects of our business showed strong growth during the quarter, and based upon these results we are raising our profit forecast for the remainder of the year." The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues 16% to $248.7 million compared to $214.5 million last year. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 8.3% during the first quarter of 2005 compared to the first quarter of 2004. Same store revenues also increased 4.9% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of March 2005. Rentals and fees for the quarter increased 21% and franchise royalties and fees increased 22%. These revenue increases were offset by a slight decline in sales, most significantly non-retail sales to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees. Non-retail sales are low margin sales to franchisees of rental merchandise from the Company's fulfillment centers, and vary from quarter to quarter based upon product demand and availability. The increase in the Company's franchise revenues is the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $108.3 million during the first quarter of 2005, a 24% increase over the comparable prior year period. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. During the first quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 22 new Company-operated stores and 12 new franchised stores. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired eight franchised stores, acquired one store from an independent rental operator, and acquired the accounts from five other third party stores, with one of the account purchases being sold to one of the Company's franchisees. During 2005 the Company awarded area development agreements to open 29 additional franchised stores. At the end of March there were 316 franchise stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years. At March 31 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division operated 646 Company-operated stores and 361 franchise stores. In addition, the Company had 58 rent-to-rent stores.
During the quarter the Company's bank debt declined from $45.5 million at December 31, 2004 to $13.9 million at March 31, 2005. The Company has Board authorization to purchase 2,670,502 of Aaron Rents common shares. "Our guidance for the second quarter of 2005 is to expect revenues in excess of $270 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.30 to $.32, compared to $.24 per share, excluding a one time gain, in the second quarter of 2004," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the entire 2005 year we are raising our earnings guidance and expect Company revenues in excess of $1.1 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.25. Our new store opening plans remain as planned, increasing our store count between 15% and 20% per year over the next several years." Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter and fiscal year of 2004 included a $.07 per share gain from the disposition of the Company's Rainbow Rentals, Inc. stock when Rainbow merged with Rent-A-Center, Inc. in May, 2004. "At current stock price levels and based upon our future outlook, we also plan to reinitiate our stock buyback program," said Mr. Loudermilk. Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, April 27, 2005, at 4:30 pm Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, http://www.aaronrents.com , in the "Investor Relations" section. The webcast will be archived for playback at that same site. Aaron Rents, Inc. based in Atlanta, currently has more than 1,065 Company- operated and franchised stores in 45 states, Canada, and Puerto Rico for the rental and sale of residential and office furniture, accessories, consumer electronics and household appliances. The Company also manufactures furniture, bedding and accessories at 10 facilities in four states.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On July 27, 2005, Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release to announce its financial results for the second quarter of 2005. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The press release presents certain revenue and earnings information excluding the Company's revenues and profit on the dispositions of its investments in Rainbow Rentals, Inc. stock in the second quarter of 2004 and in Rent-Way, Inc. stock in the second quarter of 2005. Because the Company is not primarily engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for trading purposes, management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures such as its revenues and earnings excluding the effect of these stock transactions is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare the core operations of the Company from period to period in a more meaningful manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1 AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER REVENUES AND EARNINGS; SAME STORE REVENUES UP 7.3%; EARNINGS GUIDANCE RAISED ATLANTA, July 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced record second quarter revenues and earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2005. For the second quarter of 2005, revenues increased 18% to $271.3 million compared to $230.3 million for the second quarter in 2004. Net earnings increased to $16.1 million versus $15.4 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.32 compared to $.30 per share last year (which included a $.07 per share gain on the disposition of Rainbow Rentals stock). For the first six months of this year, revenues advanced 16% to a record $550.7 million compared to $472.8 million for the first half of 2004. Net earnings for the first half were up 22% to a record $34.5 million versus $28.2 million for the corresponding period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first six months were $.68 for 2005 and $.56 for 2004. "We continue to execute the plans we have articulated to our investors over a number of years," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "In recent years, our business has thrived even in periods of uncertain strength in overall consumer spending habits. Our growth prospects are, as they have been, excellent and we are well on our way to meeting our operating and financial objectives for the year." Included in the Company's other revenue in the 2005 second quarter and six month results is a $565,000 gain realized from the sale of Rent-Way, Inc. common stock which the Company purchased in various open market transactions. In addition, results for the second quarter and six months of 2004 included $5.5 million in other revenue and a corresponding $3.4 million after-tax gain, or $.07 diluted per share, from the disposition of the Company's Rainbow Rentals, Inc. stock when Rainbow merged with Rent-A-Center, Inc. in May 2004. Excluding the revenue and profit from these two stock transactions in all periods, revenues would have been up 20% for the second quarter and 18% for the six months of 2005, and earnings would have been up 31% for the second quarter and 38% for the six months of this year. A schedule reconciling the Company's revenues and earnings excluding the effect of these stock transactions to its revenues and earnings determined in accordance with GAAP follows the statement of earnings and balance sheet data accompanying this release. Rentals and fees for both the second quarter and first six months increased 21% over the previous year. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 27% for the second quarter and 24% year-to-date. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased to $42.2 million for the second quarter from $35.3 million in the comparable period in 2004 and to $87.8 million for
the first six months compared to $81.8 million for the same period last year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and the shipments of non- retail sales are the result of the increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $209.5 million for the first six months of 2005, a 22% increase over the comparable prior year period. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its second quarter revenues 22% to $241.5 million compared to $198.3 million last year. First six months sales and lease ownership revenues increased 19% to $490.2 million compared to $412.9 million a year ago. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 7.3% during the second quarter of 2005 compared to the second quarter of 2004. Same store revenues also increased 4.0% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of June 2005. During the second quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 17 new Company-operated stores and 18 new franchised stores. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired 11 franchised stores, acquired 10 stores from independent rental operators, and purchased the accounts of 17 other third party stores. Through the three months and six months ended June 30, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 8 and 37 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of June there were a total of 304 franchised stores awarded that will open over the next several years. At June 30 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division had 684 Company- operated stores and 368 franchise stores. In addition, the Company operated 59 rent-to-rent stores. "Our guidance for the third quarter of 2005 is to expect revenues in excess of $270 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.26 to $.28, compared to $.21 per share in the third quarter of 2004," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "We plan to open approximately 90 new Company-operated and 70 new franchised stores in 2005, as well as continuing to add stores through acquisition. We are raising our earnings guidance for the 2005 fiscal year and expect Company revenues in excess of $1.1 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.25 to $1.28. Our initial guidance for 2006 is to continue to increase our store base between 15% and 20% per year and to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.45 to $1.55."

ITEM 1.01.
ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
           
 
On July 27, 2005, Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a note purchase agreement with affiliates of Prudential Capital Group ("Prudential"), a private, fixed-income investment business of Prudential Financial, Inc.  Pursuant to this agreement, the Company and its two subsidiaries as co-obligors issued $60 million in senior unsecured notes to the purchasers in a private placement.  The notes bear interest at the rate of 5.03% per year and mature on July 27, 2012.  Interest only payments are due quarterly for the first two years, followed by annual $12 million principal repayments plus interest for the five years thereafter, beginning on July 27, 2008.  Affiliates of Prudential were also the purchasers of the Company's $50 million aggregate principal amount of 6.88% senior unsecured notes due 2009 that were previously issued by the Company and its co-obligor subsidiaries in a private placement pursuant to its note purchase agreement dated August 15, 2002. The new note purchase agreement contains financial maintenance covenants, negative covenants regarding the Company's other indebtedness, its guarantees and investments, and other customary covenants substantially similar to the covenants in the Company's existing note purchase agreement, revolving credit facility, loan facility agreement and guaranty and its construction and lease facility, as modified by the amendments described below.  The new note purchase agreement and form of senior note is filed as Exhibit 10(ee) to this Report.
 
Contemporaneously with entering into the new note purchase agreement and issuing the notes, the Company also entered into amendments dated July 27, 2005 to:
 
its existing note purchase agreement;
 - 
     
its $87 million revolving credit agreement dated May 28, 2004;
 - 
     
its $140 million loan facility agreement and guaranty dated May 28, 2004, as amended, pursuant to which the Company guarantees the borrowings of certain of its independent franchisees; and
 - 
     
its $25 million construction and lease facility dated October 31, 2001, as amended, pursuant to which the Company leases properties from a bank holding company that initially purchased and/or constructed such properties at the Company's direction, and for which Company provides a residual value guarantee.
 - 
     
 
The amendments were entered into for the purpose of permitting the new issuance of the 5.03% senior notes described above, and to generally amend the negative covenants in such agreements to make them less restrictive.  As noted above, such covenants are substantially similar to the covenants in the new note purchase agreement.  For further information on the Company's existing note purchase agreement, revolving credit agreement, loan facility agreement and guaranty and construction and lease facility, see Notes D and F to the Company's consolidated financial statements appearing in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, Note F to its unaudited consolidated financial statements appearing in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2005, and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources" and "Commitments" appearing in such Form 10-Q.
 
The amendments to these agreements are filed as exhibits to this Report (along with a prior amendment to the existing note purchase agreement).
The foregoing summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements filed as exhibits to this Report.  In the event of any conflict between the foregoing summaries and the full text of the agreements, the text of such agreements shall control.

AARON RENTS, INC. By: /s/ Gilbert L. Danielson -------------------------- Gilbert L. Danielson Executive Vice President, Date: September 1, 2005 Chief Financial Officer

Exhibit 99.1 ATLANTA, Aug. 31 -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the rental, sales and lease ownership, and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today stated that it is currently assessing the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the operations of its stores in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Preliminary reports indicate that the damage to these stores will be significant. As of today, 20 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores are closed and 12 stores in Louisiana and Mississippi are either underwater or have significant water damage. "Our foremost concern is the safety and well being of our employees and customers, as well as all of the citizens of the affected areas," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "The current difficulty in communicating to our employees and getting to many of the stores has made an accurate assessment of the damage impossible at this time. It could be weeks or months before the actual cost of the hurricane can be determined." Aaron Rents currently has 46 stores in Louisiana, 25 stores in Mississippi, and 34 stores in Alabama. Of these stores, one store in Louisiana, five stores in Mississippi, and 16 stores in Alabama are franchised operations. The most severely effected stores at this time are eight Company- operated stores in the New Orleans area and three Company-operated stores and a franchised store on the Mississippi coast. Based upon a very preliminary assessment, total property loss and business interruption expense for all of the stores affected by the hurricane could range from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. This loss would include insured losses of merchandise, property, and other contents at store locations in addition to uninsured losses of merchandise in customer's homes. In addition, although not possible to accurately estimate at this time, a significant amount of ongoing business will be lost for a substantial period of time at the most seriously damaged stores. The current total average monthly revenue at the above-mentioned New Orleans and coastal Mississippi stores is approximately $1,100,000 per month. "Our business was adversely impacted somewhat in the third quarter of last year by the three hurricanes in Florida," Mr. Loudermilk, Sr. continued. "However, those hurricanes did not have the significant widespread flooding and water damage these communities are experiencing from Katrina. Our history on past major hurricanes, such as Hurricane Andrew a number of years ago, is that our business substantially picks up three to six months after the storm occurs as customers, many with the aid of government assistance, return to homes and need replacement furnishings." The Company is designating $200,000 of funds in the Aaron's Community Outreach Program for assistance to Company employees affected by the hurricane and is also donating 50,000 cases of bottled water to the American Red Cross. Aaron Rents, Inc. based in Atlanta, currently has more than 1,135 Company- operated and franchised stores in 46 states, Canada, and Puerto Rico for the rental and sale of residential and office furniture, accessories, consumer electronics and household appliances. The Company also manufactures furniture, bedding and accessories at 10 facilities in four states.
"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aaron Rents, Inc.'s business which are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues, and the risks and uncertainties discussed under "Certain Factors Affecting Forward Looking Statements" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004, which discussion is incorporated herein by this reference.

ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
          ATLANTA, October 27, 2005  Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
          Revenues for the Company increased 20% for the third quarter, including a 22% increase in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division.  Same store revenues for the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division were up 8.4% for the third quarter compared to the same period a year ago.  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita negatively impacted earnings in the quarter.
          For the third quarter of 2005, revenues increased 20% to $278.7 million compared to $231.6 million for the same period a year ago.  Net earnings were $8.8 million versus $10.6 million for the same quarter last year.  Diluted earnings per share were $.17 compared to $.21 per share in 2004.
          For the first nine months of this year, revenues advanced 18% to $829.4 million compared to $704.4 million for the first nine months of 2004.  Net earnings for the nine months were up 12% to $43.4 million versus $38.8 million for the corresponding period last year.  Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months were $.85 for 2005 and $.77 for 2004.
          "Our third quarter results were obviously negatively affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents.  "Approximately 125 of our Company-operated stores and five franchised stores in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama had operations affected to some degree, with 18 of our Company-operated stores being severely impacted by these two disastrous storms.  In addition, although our revenue growth has been excellent, high energy prices, increasing operating costs, and economic uncertainties have begun to create a more difficult market environment for many of our stores."
          Included in the third quarter and first nine months financial results was $3.9 million of the estimated loss of merchandise in customers' homes and in stores that was either destroyed or severely damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, of which approximately $1.1 million is expected to be covered by insurance proceeds.  The net pre-tax expense recorded in the third quarter for these estimated damages was $2.8 million, or $.04 per diluted share.  The Company also estimates that property damage to stores in the affected markets will approximate $1.0 million, with insurance proceeds expected to fully cover these estimated costs.  In addition, included in other income for the third quarter is $721,000 of expected proceeds from business interruption insurance associated with the operations of the hurricane-affected stores.
          Although difficult to accurately quantify, the revenues and profitability of the stores in the four states in the hurricanes' path were adversely affected in the third quarter beyond insurance proceeds due to the displacement of customers, business closings and interruptions, collection difficulties, salary continuation and assistance for employees, and other extra costs. 
          "As we have stated before, our experience on past major hurricanes is that our business picks up three to six months after the storm occurs as customers return to their homes and need replacement furnishings," Mr. Loudermilk, Sr. continued.  "We expect these events to result in increased business over the longer term, although the higher incidence of customer displacement caused by Hurricane Katrina in particular compared with past storms may affect this expectation.  We will continue to assess the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita."
          The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its third quarter revenues 22% to $249.2 million compared to $204.3 million last year.  First nine months sales and lease ownership revenues increased 20% to $739.3 million compared to $617.2 million a year ago.
          Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 8.4% during the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004.  Same store revenues also increased 4.7% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of September 2005. 
          The Company's rent-to-rent division increased revenues 6% during the third quarter to $28.7 million compared to $27.0 million a year ago.  This division has seen a significant increase in revenues since Hurricane Katrina and revenues for the fourth quarter are expected to be up over 12%.  Due to the substantial upfront costs of rapidly delivering merchandise to customers, earnings for the division were down 13% for the quarter to $1.5 million.
          Rentals and fees for both the third quarter and the first nine months increased 21% over the previous year.  In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 15% for the third quarter and 21% year-to-date.   Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 19% to $43.7 million for the third quarter from $36.8 million in the comparable period in 2004 and 11% to $131.5 million for the first nine months compared to $118.6 million for the same period last year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and the shipments of non-retail sales are the result of the increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $312.3 million for the first nine months of 2005, a 19% increase over the comparable prior year period.  Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc.               
          During the third quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 13 new Company-operated stores, 22 new franchised stores and five RIMCO stores.  In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired seven franchised stores, three stores from independent rental operators, and purchased the accounts of two other third party stores.  The Company also closed five Company-operated stores during the quarter, four of which were in the New Orleans market.  The Company expects new store openings for Company-operated and franchised stores combined to exceed 140 in 2005, in addition to a small number of third party acquisitions.
          Through the three months and nine months ended September 30, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 13 and 50 additional franchised stores, respectively.   At the end of September there were a total of 292 franchised stores awarded that are expected to be opened over the next several years.
          At September 30 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division had 699 Company-operated stores and 383 franchised stores, as well as eight RIMCO stores.  In addition, the Company operated 59 rent-to-rent stores.
          "Even though our customers are facing some challenges which may slightly affect our revenue growth, and the effects of the hurricanes will still linger into the fourth quarter and beyond, we still anticipate strong growth for the fourth quarter and on into 2006.  We expect in the fourth quarter of 2005 to achieve revenues in excess of $285 million, an 18% plus increase over the previous year's quarter, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.26 to $.29," Mr. Loudermilk, Sr. continued.  "For the 2005 fiscal year we expect Company revenues in excess of $1.1 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.11 to $1.14.  Our guidance for 2006 is to continue to increase our store base over 15% per year and to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.45 to $1.55."
          Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Thursday, October 27, 2005, at 4:30 pm Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Gilbert L. Danielson Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR RESULTS; REVENUES UP 22% FOR QUARTER; 19% FOR YEAR; SAME STORE REVENUES UP 11.5%; DILUTED EPS $.29 FOR QUARTER; $1.14 FOR YEAR ATLANTA, February 22, 2006 - Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2005, revenues increased 22% to $296.2 million compared to $242.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. Net earnings for the fourth quarter increased to $14.6 million versus $13.8 million last year. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $.29 compared to $.27 per share a year ago. For the year, revenues increased 19% to $1.1 billion compared to $946.5 million for 2004. Net earnings for the year increased to $58.0 million versus $52.6 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.14 for 2005 compared to $1.04 in 2004. "We are pleased with our fourth quarter results and believe we are on track to continue our rapid expansion in the 2006 year," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "Our intermediate term goal is to have 2,000 stores open, a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores, and feel we can achieve that in a few years. For the fourth quarter, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues to $265.5 million, a 24% increase over the $214.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. For the year, revenues were $1.0 billion, a 21% increase over the $831.1 million recorded last year. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 11.5% during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Same store revenues for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2005 increased 8.3% compared to the same period a year ago. The fourth quarter was the 16th consecutive quarter that the Company has experienced an over 5% quarterly same store revenue growth compared to the same quarter a year ago.
The Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division, the Company's rent-to-rent operations, increased revenues 8% during the fourth quarter to $30.0 million compared to $27.8 million for the fourth quarter a year ago. Revenues for the year were $117.5 million, up 8% from $108.5 million a year earlier. Consolidated rentals and fees increased 23% for the fourth quarter and 22% for the year. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 9% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the year. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 28% for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year and 15% for the year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and the shipments of non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $419.7 million for the year of 2005, a 17% increase from the comparable prior year period. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Included in the Company's other revenue in 2005 is a $565,000 gain and a corresponding $355,000 after-tax gain, previously reported, realized from the sale of shares of a competitor's common stock which had been purchased by the Company in various open market transactions. In addition, results for 2004 included $5.5 million in other revenue and a corresponding $3.4 million after-tax gain, or $.07 per diluted share, from the sale of another competitor's stock also acquired on the open market. While these stock sales had a positive impact on earnings in those periods, the size of the 2004 stock sale masks the strong period over period improvement in earnings -- excluding the profit from these two stock transactions in both periods, earnings would have been up 17% for the 2005 year compared to 2004. During the fourth quarter, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 24 new Company-operated stores, 19 new franchised stores, and one RIMCO store. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired nine stores from three different franchisees. The Company also acquired 19 stores in the fourth quarter from an independent rental operator, seven of which were merged into existing Aaron's Company-operated stores, seven were opened as new Company-operated stores, and another five were sold to franchisees. During the quarter the Company also purchased the accounts of three other third party stores. For the 2005 year, the Company and its franchisees added a net of 167 sales and lease ownership stores, a 16% increase for the year in store count, including, in addition to acquisitions, the opening of 75 new Company-operated stores and 71 new franchised stores. During the fourth quarter and fiscal year the Company awarded area development agreements to open 14 and 64 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of December 2005 there were 272 franchise stores awarded that are planned to be opened over the next several years.
At December 31, 2005 the Company had 1,198 stores open, of which the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division accounted for 739 Company-operated stores, 392 franchise stores, and nine RIMCO stores. The Company also had 58 rent-to-rent stores. "We expect revenues in the first quarter of 2006 to be in excess of $315 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.38 to $.41," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the 2006 year we expect Company revenues in excess of $1.3 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.45 to $1.55. We also anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will continue to record very positive quarterly same store revenue growth. We plan to increase our combined Company-operated and franchised store count approximately 15% per annum during the next several years." Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly and annual financial results on Thursday, February 23, 2006, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

Exhibit 99.1 AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER REVENUES UP 24%; SAME STORE REVENUES UP 10.7% ATLANTA, April 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT) the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2006. For the first quarter of 2006, revenues increased 24% to $347.3 million compared to $279.3 million for the same quarter a year ago. Net earnings increased 17% to $21.6 million versus $18.4 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.42 compared to $.36 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005. "We are extremely pleased with these results and feel good about our prospects for the remainder of the 2006 year," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "Our management team has consistently performed at a level that has delivered superior results to our shareholders, and this quarter was no exception." For the first quarter, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues 26% to $314.3 million compared to $248.7 million last year. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 10.7% during the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005. Same store revenues also increased 7.0% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of March 2006. The Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division increased revenues 7% during the quarter to $32.3 million compared to $30.2 million recorded in the first quarter a year ago. Consolidated rentals and fees increased 22% and franchise royalties and fees increased 14% during the first quarter of 2006 compared to the same period a year ago. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 40% for the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and the shipments of non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $127.4 million during the first quarter of 2006, an 18% increase over the comparable prior year period. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Included in first quarter results was a $950,000 pre-tax expense, or approximately $.01 per diluted share, resulting from the Company's adoption on January 1, 2006 of accounting for stock options as compensation expense under the guidelines of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R. During the quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 13 new Company-operated stores and 11 new franchised stores. In addition, the Company acquired three franchised stores and the accounts from two other third party stores were purchased and merged into existing stores. In addition, area development agreements were awarded to open five additional franchised stores. At the end of March there were 250 franchised stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years. At March 31, 2006, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division accounted for 755 Company-operated stores, 400 franchised stores, and nine RIMCO stores. The Company also had 59 corporate furnishings stores. "Our guidance for the second quarter of 2006 is to expect revenues in excess of $310 million and diluted earnings per share, prior to the proposed stock offering announced separately today, in the range of $.34 to $.36," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the entire 2006 year we continue to expect Company revenues in excess of $1.3 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share, again before the proposed issuance of additional shares, in the range of $1.45 to $1.55. We plan to increase our store count approximately 15% per year over the next several years."
Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Thursday, April 27, 2006, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

Other than the Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity securities or interests representing greater than 5% of the outstanding capital stock or other equity securities or interests of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association or other entity.

There are no preemptive or other similar rights to subscribe for or to purchase any securities of the Company. Except as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no warrants, options or other rights to purchase any securities of the Company.

(a) On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Selling Shareholder agree to sell to the Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto, and the Underwriters agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company and the Selling Shareholder, at a purchase price of $24.4625 per share (representing a public offering price of $25.75 per share, less an underwriting discount of $1.2875 per share), the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto. (b) On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Selling Shareholder hereby grant an option to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, to purchase up to an additional 600,000 Option Shares on the same terms and conditions as the Firm Shares. The option hereby granted will expire if not exercised within the 30-day period after the date of this Agreement. The option granted hereby may be exercised by the Underwriters, in whole or in part (but not more than once), only for the purpose of covering over-allotments that may be made in connection with the offering and distribution of the Firm Shares, by giving written notice to the Company. The notice of exercise shall set forth the number of Option Shares as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the time and date of payment and delivery thereof.

In addition, in the event that any or all of the Option Shares are purchased by the Underwriters, payment of the purchase price for and delivery of the Option Shares shall be made at the offices of Alston & Bird LLP in the manner set forth above, or at such other place as the Company and SunTrust shall determine, on the Date of Delivery as specified in the notice from SunTrust to the Company.

(d) The Shares to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Underwriters may request in writing at least two full business days before the Closing Date.

The Company will comply with Rule 433 of the Securities Act Regulations with regard to each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.

The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Shares have been qualified as above provided.

(l) For a period of 90 days after the date of the Prospectus (the "Lock-Up Period"), the Company will not, without the prior written consent of SunTrust (which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion), directly or indirectly, (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell (including without limitation any short sale), sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of, establish or increase a "put equivalent position" or liquidate or decrease a "call equivalent position" (in each case as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) or otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of Common Stock, the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.50 per share (the "Class A Stock"), or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock or Class A Stock, (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequences of ownership of Common Stock or Class A Stock, whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock, Class A Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce an intention to do or file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to any of the foregoing, except (x) grants of employee stock options, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights with respect to the Company's Common Stock pursuant to the terms of a plan in effect on the date hereof and (y) issuances of the Company's Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock options granted pursuant to the terms of a plan in effect on the date hereof; notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) during the last 17 days of the 90-day lock-up period, the Company issues an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs; or (B) prior to the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, the Company announces that it will release earnings results or becomes aware that material news or a material event will occur during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 90-day lock-up period, until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event, as applicable, the Lock-Up Period will be extended unless SunTrust waives, in writing, such extension. (m) For a period of three years from the date hereof, the Company will maintain a transfer agent and, if necessary under the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company, a registrar (which may be the same entity as the transfer agent) for its Common Stock. (n) If at any time during the 30-day period after the date of this Agreement, any publication or event relating to or affecting the Company shall occur as a result of which in your reasonable opinion the market price of the Common Stock has been or is likely to be materially affected (regardless of whether such publication or event necessitates a supplement or amendment of the Prospectus), the Company agrees to forthwith consult and cooperate with the Underwriters concerning the Company's response to or comment on such publication or event, subject in all cases to the Company's obligations under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, and the rules of the NYSE. 15

(a) Subject to the limitations in this paragraph below, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors, officers, employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all such persons, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which any such Underwriter or any such other person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter and each such partner, director, officer, employee and controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter, partner, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, such Preliminary Prospectus, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information specified in Section 9(f) below. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have. (b) Subject to Section 9(g) of this Agreement, the Selling Shareholder will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors, officers, employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all such persons, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which any such Underwriter or any such other person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Selling Shareholder Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter and each such partner, director, officer, employee and controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter, partner, director, officer, employee or 19

This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Selling Shareholder may otherwise have. (c) Each Underwriter, severally but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement, the Selling Shareholder and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all such persons, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or any such person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Selling Shareholder Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, such Preliminary Prospectus, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, such Selling Shareholder Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company and the Selling Shareholder by such Underwriter expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information specified in Section 9(f) below, and will reimburse the Company or any such director, officer, the Selling Shareholder and any controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, the Selling Shareholder and any controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Underwriters may otherwise have. (d) Within ten days after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c) above of notice of commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission or any delay to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 9. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election 20
so to assume the defense thereof the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of counsel by such indemnified party has been authorized by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in the conduct of the defense of such action (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in any of which events the fees and expenses of one such counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances under which the indemnity provided for in this Section 9 is for any reason unavailable or insufficient, each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnity (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholder on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, from the offering and sale of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative and several fault of the Company and the Selling Shareholder on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative and several benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholder on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Selling Shareholder on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Shareholder on the one hand, or by the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Shareholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 was determined by a pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection 9(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person 21
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of subsection 9(e), the partners, directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. (f) For purposes of this Section 9, the Underwriters severally confirm, and the Company and the Selling Shareholder acknowledge, that the first sentence of the second paragraph, the fifth paragraph and the eleventh paragraph under "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus constitutes the only information furnished by the Underwriters to the Company for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Registration Statement. (g) The liability of the Selling Shareholder under this Section 9 shall be limited to an amount equal to the public offering price, less the underwriting discount, of the Shares sold by the Selling Shareholder to the Underwriters. Section 10. Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery. The representations, warranties, indemnities, agreements and other statements of the Company, the Selling Shareholder and the Underwriters, set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company and the Selling Shareholder, any Underwriter or any representative, officer, director or any controlling person with respect to an Underwriter or the Company, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Shares or termination of this Agreement. Section 11. Termination. (a) This Agreement shall be subject to termination by you, if prior to the Closing Time or the Date of Delivery (if different from the Closing Date and then only as to the Option Shares), as the case may be, (i) (A) trading in securities generally on the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market, or (B) trading in the Company's Common Stock on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market, shall have been suspended or the settlement of such trading generally shall have been materially disrupted or minimum prices shall have been established on any such exchange or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by any other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal, New York or Georgia authorities, (iii) the United States shall have become engaged in hostilities, there shall have been an escalation in hostilities involving the United States or there shall have been a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred such a material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions, including without limitation as a result of terrorist activities or any other crisis or calamity after the date hereof, or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the completion of the public offering or the sale or payment for the Shares. Notice of such cancellation shall be promptly given to the Company and its counsel by telegraph, telecopy or telephone and shall be subsequently confirmed by letter. 22
(b) The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice to the Company and the Selling Shareholder at any time at or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 8 of this Agreement. (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions of any subsection of this Section 11, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except that, notwithstanding any such termination, (i) the provisions of Section 7 and Section 9 shall remain in effect, and (ii) if any Shares have been purchased hereunder, the representations and warranties in Section 1 and Section 2 and all obligations under Section 4 and Section 5 shall also remain in effect. Section 12. Default by One or More of the Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you, another party, or other parties to purchase such Firm Shares on the terms contained herein. If within 36 hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Shares, then the Company or the Selling Shareholder shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Firm Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company and the Selling Shareholder that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Shares, or the Company or the Selling Shareholder notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Shares, you or the Company or the Selling Shareholder shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period of not more than seven days in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.

Exhibit 99.1 AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER REVENUES AND EARNINGS; SAME STORE REVENUES UP 9.1%; TO ACCELERATE NEW STORE OPENINGS ATLANTA, July 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2006. For the second quarter of 2006, revenues increased 19% to $321.7 million compared to $271.3 million for the second quarter in 2005. Net earnings increased 28% to $20.7 million versus $16.1 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.39 compared to $.32 per share last year. For the first six months of this year, revenues advanced 21% to $669.0 million compared to $550.7 million for the first half of 2005. Net earnings for the first six months were up 22% to $42.2 million versus $34.5 million for the corresponding period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first six months were $.81 for 2006 and $.68 for 2005. "We are pleased with the results for the quarter," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "Our business plan remains to rapidly increase our revenues and store base through the opening of new Company-operated and franchised stores, plus selective acquisitions. We are very confident of the prospects for our business and are accelerating our store opening plans. We anticipate adding approximately 350 new Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores over the next 18 months, a 30% increase over the current store base." The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its second quarter revenues 20% to $290.2 million compared to $241.5 million last year. First six months sales and lease ownership revenues increased 23% to $604.5 million compared to $490.2 million a year ago. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 9.1% during the second quarter of 2006 compared to the second quarter of 2005. Same store revenues also increased 6.0% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of June 2006. The Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division increased revenues 9% during the second quarter to $31.1 million compared to $28.5 million a year ago. First six months corporate furnishings revenues were $63.4 million compared to $58.7 million last year, an 8% increase. Included in the Company's other revenues in the 2006 second quarter and six month results is a pre-tax gain of $4.4 million, or approximately $.06 per diluted share, from the sale at the end of June of the assets of the Company's 12 stores located in Puerto Rico. Also, included in the Company's other revenues in the 2005 second quarter and six month results is a $565,000 pre- tax gain, or approximately $.01 per diluted share, realized from the sale of Rent-Way, Inc. common stock which the Company purchased in various open market transactions. Included in operating expenses in both the first and second quarter of 2006 was a $950,000 pre-tax expense, or approximately $.01 per diluted share each quarter, resulting from the Company's adoption on January 1, 2006 of accounting for stock options as compensation expense under the guidelines of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R. Consolidated rentals and fees for the second quarter increased 19% and the first six months increased 20% over the previous year. In addition, franchise royalties and fees were up 12% and 13% for the second quarter and year-to- date, respectively. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased to $46.4 million for the second quarter from $42.2 million in the comparable period in 2005 and to $110.4 million for the first six months compared to $87.8 million for the same period last year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and the shipments of non-retail sales are the result of the increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $118.0 million during the second quarter and $245.4 million for the first six months of 2006, a 17% increase over both the comparable prior year periods. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc.
During the second quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 12 new Company-operated stores and 15 new franchised stores. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired eight franchised stores and three stores from independent rental operators, and purchased the accounts of four other third party stores. As previously noted above, the Company also sold all 12 of its stores in Puerto Rico. Through the three months and six months ended June 30, the Company awarded area development agreements to open three and eight additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of June there were a total of 237 franchised stores awarded that will open over the next several years. At June 30, 2006 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division had 766 Company-operated stores, 406 franchised stores, and ten RIMCO stores. In addition, the Company operated 59 corporate furnishings stores. During the second quarter the Company sold 3,450,000 shares of Common Stock in a secondary stock offering, using the proceeds of approximately $84 million to pay down bank debt. At the end of June 2006 the Company had no borrowings under its $140 million revolving credit agreement and had $24 million of cash on hand. "Our revenue growth over a number of years has been excellent and we expect these trends to continue as we aggressively expand our operations," Mr. Loudermilk added. "As always our future earnings will be impacted by losses incurred as a result of the opening of new stores, and these losses will be somewhat higher in future periods with our accelerated new store growth plans. We plan to work on initiatives that we expect will improve margins to partially offset increases in normal operating costs and some of the effect of the new store start-up expenses." "Our guidance for the third quarter of 2006 is to expect revenues in excess of $320 million and diluted earnings per share, after the effect of the secondary stock offering, in the range of $.30 to $.33, compared to $.17 per share in the third quarter of 2005," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "We plan to open approximately 65 new Company-operated and 35 new franchised stores the last half of 2006, and approximately 150 new Company-operated and 100 new franchised stores in fiscal year 2007. Our revised guidance for the 2006 fiscal year is to expect Company revenues in excess of $1.3 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share, including the gain on the Puerto Rico sale, in the range of $1.46 to $1.50." Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Thursday, July 27, 2006, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

Exhibit 99.1 AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS; REVENUES UP 14%; NET EARNINGS UP 97% ATLANTA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006. For the third quarter of 2006, revenues increased 14% to $317.7 million compared to $278.7 million for the same period a year ago. Net earnings were $17.4 million versus $8.8 million for the third quarter last year, a 97% increase. Diluted earnings per share were $.32 compared to $.17 per share in 2005. For the first nine months of this year, revenues advanced 19% to $986.7 million compared to $829.4 million for the same period of 2005. Net earnings for the nine months were up 37% to $59.6 million versus $43.4 million for the corresponding period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months were $1.13 for 2006 and $.85 for 2005. "We are again pleased with our operating performance," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "Our rapid store expansion continues as planned and we are on track to add approximately 350 stores, a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores, over the 18 month period ending on December 31, 2007. We look forward to the remainder of 2006 and 2007 with great optimism." The Company's net earnings in the third quarter and nine months of 2005 were negatively affected by the loss of merchandise, damage to stores, and other costs resulting from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its third quarter revenues 15% to $286.2 million compared to $249.2 million last year. First nine months sales and lease ownership revenues increased 20% to $890.7 million compared to $739.3 million a year ago. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 6.9% during the third quarter of 2006 compared to the third quarter of 2005. Same store revenues also increased 4.0% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of September 2006. The Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division increased revenues 6% during the third quarter to $30.4 million compared to $28.7 million a year ago. Corporate furnishings revenues were up 7% for the nine months to $93.8 million compared to $87.4 million in 2005. Consolidated rentals and fees increased 16% for the third quarter and 19% for the first nine months compared to the previous year. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 8% for the third quarter and 11% year- to-date. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 13% to $49.4 million for the third quarter from $43.7 million in the comparable period in 2005, and 22% to $159.8 million for the first nine months compared to $131.5 million for the same period last year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of the increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $118.4 million for the third quarter and $363.7 million for the first nine months of 2006, a 15% and 16% increase, respectively, over the comparable prior year periods. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Included in operating expenses was $907,000 for the third quarter and $2.8 million for the first nine months of expense resulting from the Company's adoption on January 1, 2006 of accounting for stock options as compensation expense under the guideline of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R. During the third quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 13 new Company-operated stores, 16 new franchised stores and three RIMCO stores. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired 11 franchised stores, four stores from independent rental operators, consolidated three stores, and purchased the accounts of four other third party stores.
For the first nine months of 2006 the Company opened 38 new Company- operated stores and 42 new franchised stores, four RIMCO stores, acquired 22 franchised stores, acquired seven stores from independent rental operators, and purchased the accounts from ten other third party operators that were then merged into Aaron's stores. Through the three months and nine months ended September 30, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 17 and 25 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of September there were a total of 229 franchised stores awarded that will open over the next several years. At September 30 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division had 791 Company-operated stores and 411 franchised stores, as well as 13 RIMCO stores. In addition, the Company operated 59 corporate furnishings stores. The total number of stores open at the end of September was 1,274. At the end of September 2006 the Company had no borrowings under its $140 million revolving credit agreement and had $54.7 million of cash on hand. "We expect in the fourth quarter of 2006 to record revenues in excess of $335 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.32 to $.36, and plan to add approximately 70 more stores," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the 2006 fiscal year we expect Company revenues in excess of $1.3 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.45 to $1.49, which includes a $.06 per diluted share gain in the second quarter from the sale of our Puerto Rico stores. Our guidance for 2007 is to add approximately 250 more stores, a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores, and to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.55 to $1.65." Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Thursday, October 26, 2006, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

ITEM 5.02. DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS. On December 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") met and approved amendments to discounted stock options to purchase common stock granted as deferred compensation in 2004 to certain executives of the Company under the 2001 Aaron Rents, Inc. Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan ("2004 Option Agreement Amendment"). The 2004 Option Agreement Amendment raises the exercise price of each of the stock options to the fair market value of the common stock on the original grant date, adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock dividend that occurred on August 2, 2004 in the case of those stock options with an original grant date that preceded the stock dividend date. The 2004 Option Agreement Amendment also provides that, in order to compensate the grantees for the increase in the exercise price of the stock options, the full original discounted amount will be paid in cash on the applicable 2007 vesting date. Specifically, the Company will make cash payments, computed by multiplying the original number of shares of common stock underlying the stock option by the sum of the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the original date of grant minus the original exercise price, to R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., Gilbert L. Danielson and William K. Butler, Jr. on the vesting dates and in the amounts as follows: (i) May 13, 2007 - - each of Messrs Loudermilk, Sr., Loudermilk, Jr. and Danielson will receive $115,500 and Mr. Butler will receive $231,000; (ii) July 30, 2007 - each of Messrs Loudermilk, Sr., Loudermilk, Jr. and Danielson will receive $128,370 and Mr. Butler will receive $256,740; and (iii) November 1, 2007 - each of Messrs Loudermilk, Sr., Loudermilk, Jr. and Danielson will receive $73,773 and Mr. Butler will receive $147,547. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety to the full text of each 2004 Option Agreement Amendment, a copy of the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10(pp).

Exhibit 10(pp) FORM OF AMENDMENT TO OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT UNDER THE AARON RENTS, INC. STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN. December 20, 2006 [Grantee Name] PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL Dear [Grantee]: Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") previously granted you options to purchase common stock of the Company under the Aaron Rents, Inc. Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"), which have an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of a share of stock on the grant date (the "Options"). Under recent tax law changes, these discount Options could subject you to an additional 20% income tax unless the Options are amended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A"). The Compensation Committee of the Company has determined it is best to amend these Options to provide that the exercise price shall be increased to equal the fair market value per share on the grant date, adjusted, if applicable, to reflect the Company's 3 for 2 stock split that occurred August 2, 2004. In addition, to compensate you for the increase in the exercise price of the Options, the Company will pay you the original total discount amount in cash on the Vesting Date (as listed below) if you remain employed until the Vesting Date or if you die or terminate employment due to Retirement (as defined in the Plan) prior to the Vesting Date. If you terminate employment prior to the Vesting Date for any reason other than death or Retirement, you will have no right to receive the cash discount amount. The table below lists for each Option grant: the grant date, the original number of shares subject to each grant, the original exercise price, the fair market value of a share of stock on the grant date, the adjusted number of shares (adjusted, if applicable, to reflect the Company's 3 for 2 stock split), the amended, adjusted exercise price (which equals the fair market value on the grant date, adjusted, if applicable, to reflect the Company's 3 for 2 stock split), the total discount amount that will be paid to you in cash on the Vesting Date, and the Vesting Date.
This amendment is intended to comply with Section 409A and the guidance issued thereunder, including Notice 2005-1, the proposed regulations under Section 409A that were published October 4, 2005, and Notice 2006-79. It is intended that the Options, as hereby amended, will be exempt from Section 409A and that the cash payment of the original discount amount will comply with the requirements of Section 409A. The Options may be further amended if required to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A including any final regulations issued thereunder. Please sign below to indicate your consent to the amendment of your Options as described in this letter agreement. Sincerely, Gilbert L. Danielson Executive Vice President and CFO I hereby agree to the amendment of the Options listed above to eliminate the original discount by increasing the exercise prices as detailed above. I understand that if I remain employed until the applicable Vesting Date (or if I die or terminate employment due to Retirement prior to the Vesting Date), the Company will pay me the total original discount in a lump sum payment, subject to applicable withholding for taxes, on such Vesting Date. Except as hereby amended, the Options shall continue in accordance with their terms. GRANTEE ----------------------- [Grantee Name]

Exhibit 99.1 AARON RENTS, INC. REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR RESULTS; NET EARNINGS UP 30% FOR QUARTER; 36% FOR YEAR ATLANTA, Feb. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. For the fourth quarter of 2006, revenues increased 15% to $339.9 million compared to $296.2 million for the fourth quarter in 2005. Net earnings increased 30% to $19.0 million versus $14.6 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.35 compared to $.29 per share a year ago. For the year, revenues increased 18% to $1.327 billion compared to $1.126 billion for the 2005 year. Net earnings increased 36% to $78.6 million versus $58.0 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $1.47 for 2006 compared to $1.14 in 2005. "Our results met our expectations for the quarter and we are very pleased with our record year in revenues and earnings," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "We stated we would add 100 stores during the last half of 2006 and slightly exceeded that number. Our goal for 2007 is unchanged and we plan to add another 250 stores during the year, a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores." The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division continues to have record results. For the fourth quarter the division increased its revenues to $309.8 million, a 17% increase over the $265.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. For the year, revenues were $1.201 billion, a 19% increase over the $1.005 billion recorded last year. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 7.2% during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Same store revenues also increased 4.5% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of December 2006. The Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division revenues for the fourth quarter were $29.2 million compared to $30.0 million for the fourth quarter a year ago. Revenues for the year were $123.0 million, up 5% from $117.5 million a year earlier. Consolidated rentals and fees increased 14% for the fourth quarter and 17% for the year. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 16% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 19% for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year and 21% for the year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and the shipments of non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $121.8 million during the fourth quarter, a 13% increase over the same quarter a year ago, and $485.5 million for the 2006 year, a 16% increase over last year. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Included in operating expenses was $658,000 for the fourth quarter and $3.5 million for the year of expense resulting from the Company's adoption on January 1, 2006 of accounting for stock options as compensation expense under the guidelines of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R. During the fourth quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 31 new Company-operated stores, 33 new franchised stores, and five RIMCO stores. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired 12 stores from five different franchisees, one store from a third party rental operator, and sold three stores to two franchisees. For the 2006 year, the Company and its franchisees added a net of 146 sales and lease ownership stores, a 13% increase for the year in total store count for the division, including, in addition to acquisitions, the opening of 78 new Company-operated stores and 75 new franchised stores.
In the fourth quarter two rental chains converted their stores to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores. This transaction resulted in 17 new franchised stores for the Company and the execution of area development agreements to open an additional eight franchised stores in future periods. As part of this transaction, the Company acquired six stores from the two chains and converted four of them to Company-operated stores, the remaining two acquired stores were merged into existing Company-operated stores. Additionally, the new franchisees purchased three Company-operated stores, which now are open as franchised stores. The Company realized a $2.2 million gain in the fourth quarter on the sale of the three stores to the franchisees. It is expected that more conversions of independent operators will occur in future periods. During the fourth quarter and fiscal year the Company awarded, in total, area development agreements to open 48 and 73 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of December 2006 there were 233 franchise stores awarded that are planned to be opened over the next several years. At December 31, 2006 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division accounted for 828 Company-operated stores, 441 franchised stores, and 17 RIMCO stores. The Company also had 59 corporate furnishings stores. The total number of stores open at the end of 2006 was 1,345. "We expect revenues in the first quarter of 2007 to be in excess of $390 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.45 to $.49," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the 2007 year we expect Company revenues in excess of $1.5 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.55 to $1.65."

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On April 25, 2007, Aaron Rents, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The press release presents the Company's net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2007 excluding the gain from the sale of a parking deck at the Company's corporate headquarters. As material real estate sales are not part of the Company's usual businesses, management believes that presentation of this particular non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it allows investors to more easily evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's core sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishings businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

Aaron Rents, Inc. Reports Record First Quarter Results; Earnings Up 35% ATLANTA, April 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2007. For the first quarter of 2007, revenues increased 12% to $387.9 million compared to $347.3 million for the same quarter a year ago. Net earnings were up 35% to $29.2 million versus $21.6 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.53 compared to $.42 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006. Included in the Company's other revenues in the first quarter of 2007 was a $4.9 million gain from the sale of a parking deck at the Company's corporate headquarters. Excluding this gain, net earnings on a non-GAAP basis for the first quarter would have been $26.2 million or $.48 per diluted share. "We feel that our first quarter was a good start for 2007," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "We plan to continue to aggressively expand operations and look forward to adding more stores in future periods." For the first quarter, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues 12% to $351.2 million compared to $314.3 million for the first quarter last year. Same store rental revenues (rental revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 9.3% during the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006. Total same store revenues for these stores, which includes the rental revenue gain offset by a decline in retail sales and early payouts of lease ownership agreements, increased 5.4% for the first quarter of this year compared to the quarter last year. The Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division revenues declined 3% during the quarter to $31.2 million compared to the $32.3 million recorded in the first quarter a year ago. The division's revenues were aided last year from increased business related to the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region in 2005. Consolidated rentals and fees advanced increased 12% and franchise royalties and fees increased 19% during the first quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 10% for the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $147.6 million during the first quarter of 2007, a 16% increase over the 2006 quarter. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. During the quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 13 new Company-operated stores, 13 new franchised stores, and three RIMCO stores. In addition, the Company acquired three franchised stores, sold one Company- operated store to a franchisee, and purchased the accounts from two other third party stores that were merged into existing Company-operated stores. In addition, area development agreements were awarded to open 51 additional franchised stores. At the end of March there were 258 franchised stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years. At March 31, 2007, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division had 842 Company-operated stores, 451 franchised stores, and 20 RIMCO stores. The Company also had 59 corporate furnishings stores. "Although revenue growth in the first quarter was slower than in the past quarters, due to the decline in retail sales and early payouts, margins improved as several of the initiatives we have put in place over the past year to raise profitability are showing results," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "We still expect to add 250 stores in 2007, a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores. Our guidance for the second quarter of 2007 is to expect revenues in excess of $350 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.35 to $.39," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "For the entire 2007 year we expect Company revenues of approximately $1.5 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.55 to $1.65 (excluding the gain on the parking deck sale)."
Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Thursday, April 26, 2007, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 24, 2007, Aaron Rents, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the second quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release presents the Company's growth in net earnings from the first six months of 2006 to the comparable period in 2007 excluding the gain from the sales of the Company's Puerto Rican operations in 2006 and a parking deck at the Company's corporate headquarters in 2007. It also presents the Company's estimate of its diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 excluding the gain on the sale of the parking deck. As neither dispositions of a significant number of stores to a single purchaser nor material real estate sales are common occurrences in the Company's businesses, management believes that presentation of these particular non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow investors to more easily evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's core sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishings businesses from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

Aaron Rents, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Revenues and Earnings ATLANTA, July 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2007. For the second quarter of 2007, revenues rose 12% to $359.0 million compared to $321.7 million for the second quarter of 2006. Net earnings were $19.7 million versus $20.7 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.36 compared to $.39 per share last year. Last year's second quarter results included a pre-tax gain of $4.4 million, or approximately $.06 per diluted share, from the sale of the Company's former Puerto Rico operations. For the first six months of this year, revenues were up 12% to $746.9 million compared to $669.0 million for the first six months of 2006. Net earnings for the first half of 2007 increased 16% to $48.9 million versus $42.2 million for the corresponding period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first six months were $.89 for 2007 and $.81 for 2006. Included in the Company's other revenues in the first six months of 2007 was a pre-tax $4.9 million gain from the sale in the first quarter of a parking deck at the Company's corporate headquarters. The Company's other revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2006 included the aforementioned gain from the sale of the Company's Puerto Rican stores. Excluding these two transactions the Company's net earnings on a non-GAAP basis would have been up 17% for the six months of 2007 compared to the six months of 2006. "We feel we are still on track to add 250 stores during fiscal year 2007," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "Our Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division continues to do well and our prospects for the division's future have not changed." Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division second quarter revenues increased 13% to $327.6 million compared to $290.2 million last year. First six months sales and lease ownership revenues increased 12% to $678.8 million compared to $604.5 million recorded a year ago. Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 5.0% during the second quarter of 2007 compared to the same quarter a year ago. Same store revenues increased 3.0% for Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of June 2007. Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division revenues during the second quarter were $30.6 million compared to $31.1 million a year ago and revenues for the first half were $61.8 million versus $63.4 million. Consolidated rentals and fees for both the second quarter and first half advanced 13% over the comparable previous year periods. In addition, franchise royalties and fees were up 18% and 19% for the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased to $56.7 million for the second quarter from $46.4 million in the comparable period in 2006 and to $126.9 million for the first six months compared to $110.4 million for the first six months last year. The increases in the Company's franchise revenues and the shipments of non-retail sales are the result of the increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $136.2 million during the second quarter and $283.8 million for the first six months of 2007, a 15% and 16% increase, respectively, over the prior year periods. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc.
During the second quarter the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 15 new Company-operated stores, 19 new franchised stores, acquired 14 franchised stores and sold a Company-operated store to a franchisee. The Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division also opened one new store during the quarter and purchased the accounts of a third party operator, merging these accounts into the new store. Through the three months and six months ended June 30, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 55 and 106 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of June there were a total of 276 franchised stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years. At June 30, 2007 the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division had 868 Company-operated stores, 454 franchised stores, 22 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and two franchised RIMCO stores. In addition, the Company operated 60 corporate furnishings stores. "Our 2007 store opening plans have not changed, and we anticipate adding approximately 190 stores during the second half of 2007, of which we expect roughly 35 stores will be franchised stores," Mr. Loudermilk continued. "Our guidance for the third quarter of 2007 is to expect revenues in excess of $355 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.31 to $.35. For the entire 2007 year we expect Company revenues of approximately $1.5 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and are lowering our previous diluted earnings per share range of guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 for the year to $1.50 to $1.60 (excluding the gain on the first quarter parking deck sale), primarily due to the anticipated start-up costs of the substantial number of new stores planned to be added during the last half of the year." Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, July 25, 2007, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On October 24, 2007, Aaron Rents, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the third quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release presents the Company's estimate of its diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 excluding the gain on the sale of a parking deck across from its Atlanta headquarters. As material real estate sales are not common occurrences in the Company's businesses, management believes that presentation of this particular non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it allows investors to more easily evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's core sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishings businesses from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's estimated GAAP basis diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007, which is also presented in the press release.
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
None.
None.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ATLANTA, October 24, 2007 - Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007.
For the third quarter of 2007, revenues increased 13% to $359.4 million compared to $317.7 million for the same period a year ago. Net earnings were $15.9 million versus $17.4 million for the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.29 compared to $.32 per share in 2006.
For the first nine months of this year, revenues advanced 12% to $1.106 billion compared to $986.7 million for the same period of 2006. Net earnings for the nine months were up 9% to $64.8 million versus $59.6 million for the corresponding period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months were $1.18 for 2007 and $1.13 for 2006.
We anticipate record revenues and earnings for the Company this year, said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. Our third quarter results were affected primarily, as expected per our news release a month ago, by construction delays in our aggressive program of new store openings as well as slower revenue growth and higher operating costs. Consequently, we are now focused on improving revenue growth and earnings of all our stores and, in the near term, opening new Company-operated stores at a less accelerated rate.
Our franchise system continues its strong performance with solid same store revenue growth for the quarter. We have a growing franchise expansion program with more than 300 franchised stores now in the pipeline for future opening. We anticipate that area development agreements will be awarded for a record number of stores this year, continued Mr. Loudermilk.
The Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its third quarter revenues 15% to $328.1 million compared to $286.2 million last year. First nine months sales and lease ownership revenues increased 13% to $1.007 billion compared to $890.7 million a year ago.
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 4.0% during the third quarter of 2007 compared to the third quarter of 2006.
The Aarons Corporate Furnishings division revenues declined 2% during the third quarter to $29.7 million compared to $30.4 million a year ago. Corporate furnishings revenues were $91.5 million for the nine months compared to $93.8 million in 2006.
Consolidated rentals and fees increased 14% for the third quarter and 13% for the first nine months compared to the previous year periods. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 7% for the third quarter and 15% year-to-date compared to the same periods a year ago. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 18% to $58.1 million for the third quarter from $49.4 million from the comparable period in 2006, and 16% to $185.0 million for the first nine months compared to $159.8 million for the same period last year. The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of the increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $131.3 million for the third quarter and $415.1 million for the first nine months of 2007, an 11% and 14% increase, respectively, over the comparable prior year periods. Same store revenues for franchised stores increased 8.8% for the third quarter of 2007 compared to the third quarter of 2006. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc.
 
During the third quarter the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 40 new Company-operated stores, nine new franchised stores, five Company-operated RIMCO stores, and two franchised RIMCO stores. The Company also opened one new corporate furnishings store and closed two Company-operated sales and lease ownership stores. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired 21 franchised stores and purchased the accounts of four third party stores.
Through the three months and nine months ended September 30, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 46 and 152 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of September there were a total of 302 franchised stores awarded that we expect will open over the next several years.
At September 30 the Aarons Sales and Lease Ownership division had 927 Company-operated stores and 442 franchised stores, 27 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and four franchised RIMCO stores. In addition, the Company operated 61 corporate furnishings stores. The total number of stores open at the end of September was 1,461.
We expect in the fourth quarter of 2007 to have revenues in excess of $375 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.30 to $.34, Mr. Loudermilk continued. For the 2007 fiscal year we anticipate Company revenues slightly below $1.5 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.48 to $1.52, or $1.43 to $1.47 excluding the gain on the first quarter parking deck sale. As previously announced, our new store openings in 2007 will be less than originally planned. We now expect total store growth for 2007, a combination of Company-operated and franchise stores, to be up approximately 15% for the year. We expect to increase the store base 10% to 13% in 2008, roughly an equal mix between Company-operated and franchised stores. Our initial earnings guidance for 2008 is to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.60 to $1.75.
Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Thursday, October 25, 2007, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Companys website, www.aaronrents.com, in the Investor Relations section.

Item 5.03      Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On November 13, 2007, the Board of Directors of Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") amended and restated the Company's Bylaws. The amendments expressly provide for the issuance of uncertificated shares, make updating changes to the indemnification provisions and make certain other amendments. Regarding the certificateless share amendments, under new Section 501.00 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, which will become effective January 1, 2008, issuers are required to be eligible for a direct registration program, which permits an investor's ownership to be recorded and maintained on the books of the issuer or its transfer agent without the issuance of a physical stock certificate.
     The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3(b) and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01      Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d)      Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 3(b)
 
Section 1. Registered Office. The registered office shall be in the State of Georgia, County of Fulton.
Section 2. Other Offices. The corporation may also have offices at such other places both within and without the State of Georgia as the board of directors may from time to time determine and the business of the corporation may require or make desirable.
Section 1. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the shareholders of the corporation shall be held at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place in the United States as may be determined by the board of directors, at 10:00 a.m. on the last business day of the fifth month following the close of each fiscal year or at such other time and date following the close of the fiscal year as shall be determined by the board of directors, for the purpose of electing directors and transacting such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
Section 2. Special Meetings. (a) Special meetings of shareholders of one or more classes or series of the corporation's shares shall be called by the president or the secretary (i) when so directed by the chairman or by a majority of the entire board of directors; or (ii) upon the demand of holders of at least twenty five percent (25%) of all votes entitled to be cast on each issue to be considered at a proposed special meeting of the shareholders. The business that may be transacted at any special meeting of shareholders shall be limited to that proposed in the notice of the special meeting given in accordance with Section 3 (including related or incidental matters that may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the proposed business).
(b) Promptly after the date of receipt of written shareholder demands (the "Demand Date") purporting to comply with the provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation Code, as amended from time to time (the "Code"), and these by-laws, the president or the secretary of the corporation shall determine the validity of the demand. If the demand is valid, the president or the secretary of the corporation shall call a special shareholders meeting by mailing notice within 20 days of the Demand Date.
 
(c) The time, date and place of any special shareholders meeting shall be determined by the board of directors and shall be set forth in the notice of meeting.
Section 3. Notice of Meetings. Written notice of every meeting of shareholders, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, shall be given personally or by mail to each shareholder of record not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. Such notice may be given in any manner permitted by, and shall be deemed to be effectively given at the times as provided in, the Georgia Business Corporation Code. A shareholder's attendance at a meeting waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of such meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to the holding of the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented. A shareholder may waive notice of a meeting before or after the date and time stated in the notice, which waiver must be in writing, signed by the shareholder entitled to such notice and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.
Section 4. Quorum. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the shareholders except as otherwise provided by statute, by the articles of incorporation, or by these by-laws. If a quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the shareholders, a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 5. [Reserved.]
Section 6. Voting. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power, present in person or represented by proxy, shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of law or of the articles of incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such
 
express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question. Each shareholder shall at every meeting of the shareholders be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of the capital stock having voting power registered in his or her name on the books of the corporation, but no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after 11 months from its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
Section 7. Shareholder Proposals. (a) No shareholder proposal or resolution (each a "Shareholder Proposal"), whether purporting to be binding or non-binding on the corporation or its board of directors, shall be considered at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders unless:
 
(b) The following information must be provided to the board of directors, within or at the times specified in subsection (a) above, in order for the Shareholder Proposal to be considered at the applicable shareholders meeting:
(c) Failure to fully comply with the provisions of this Section 7 shall bar discussion of and voting on the Shareholder Proposal at the applicable regular or special shareholders meeting. Any Shareholder Proposal that does not comply with the requirements of this Section 7 shall be disregarded by the chairman of the meeting, and any votes cast in support of the Shareholder Proposal, unless the Shareholder Proposal has been validly submitted by another shareholder, shall be disregarded by the chairman of such meeting.
(d) The provisions of this Section 7 shall be read in accordance with and so as not to conflict with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the corporation's shares are traded. Nothing in these By-laws shall be deemed to require the consideration at any meeting of shareholders of any Shareholder Proposal that, pursuant to law, the corporation may refuse to permit consideration thereof.
 
Section 8. Consent of Shareholders. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting if all of the shareholders consent thereto in writing, setting forth the action so taken. Such consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of shareholders.
Section 9. List of Shareholders; Inspection of Records. (a) The corporation shall keep at its registered office or principal place of business, or at the office of its transfer agent or registrar, a record of its shareholders, giving their names and addresses and the number, class and series, if any, of the shares held by each. The officer who has charge of the stock transfer books of the corporation shall prepare and make, before every meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number and class and series, if any, of shares held by each. The list shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting for the purposes thereof. The said list may be the corporation's regular record of shareholders if it is arranged in alphabetical order or contains an alphabetical index.
(b) Shareholders are entitled to inspect the corporate records as and to the extent provided by the Code; provided, however, that only shareholders owning more than two percent (2%) of the outstanding shares of any class of the corporation's stock shall be entitled to inspect (1) the minutes from any board, board committee or shareholders meeting (including any records of action taken thereby without a meeting); (2) the accounting records of the corporation; or (3) any record of the shareholders of the corporation.
Section 1. Powers. Except as otherwise provided by any legal agreement among shareholders, the property, affairs and business of the corporation shall be managed and directed by its board of directors, which may exercise all powers of the corporation and do all lawful acts and things which are not by law, by any legal agreement among shareholders, by the articles of incorporation or by these by-laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the shareholders.
Section 2. Number, Election and Term. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole board shall be eleven; provided, however, the number of directors may be increased or
 
decreased from time to time by the board of directors by amendment of this by-law, but no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of an incumbent director. The directors shall be elected by plurality vote at the annual meeting of shareholders, except as hereinafter provided, and each director elected shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or death. Directors shall be natural person who have attained the age of 18 years, but need not be residents of the State of Georgia or shareholders of the corporation.
Section 3. Nominations. (a) If any shareholder intends to nominate or cause to be nominated any candidate for election to the board of directors (other than any candidate to be sponsored by and proposed at the instance of the management), such shareholder shall notify the president by first class registered mail sent not less than 14 nor more than 50 days before the scheduled meeting of the shareholders at which directors will be elected. However, if less than 21 days notice of the meeting is given to shareholders, such nomination shall be delivered or mailed to the president not later than the close of the seventh day following the date on which the notice of the shareholders' meeting was mailed. Such notification shall contain the following information with respect to each nominee, to the extent known to the shareholder giving such notification:
 
(b) Any nominations not in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 may be disregarded by the chairman of the meeting, and upon instruction by the chairman, votes cast for each such nominee shall be disregarded. In the event, however, that a person should be nominated by more than one shareholder, and if one such nomination complies with the provisions of this Section 3, such nomination shall be honored, and all shares voted for such nominee shall be counted.
Section 4. Vacancies. Vacancies, including vacancies resulting from any increase in the number of directors, but not including vacancies resulting from removal from office by the shareholders, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and a director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then vacancies shall be filled through election by the shareholders.
Section 5. Meetings and Notice. The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Georgia. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the board. Special meetings of the board may be called by the chairman of the board or president or by any two directors on one day's oral, telegraphic or written notice duly given or served on each director personally, or three days' notice deposited, first class postage prepaid, in the United States mail. Such notice shall state a reasonable time, date and place of meeting, but the purpose need not be stated therein. A director may waive any notice required by the Code, the articles of incorporation, or these by-laws before or after the date and time of the matter to which the notice relates, by a written waiver signed by the director and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting and
 
waiver of all objections to the place and time of the meeting, or the manner in which it has been called or convened except when the director states, at the beginning of the meeting, any such objection or objections to the transaction of business.
Section 6. Quorum. At all meetings of the board a majority of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, by the articles of incorporation, or by these by-laws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the board, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
Section 7. Conference Telephone Meeting. Unless the articles of incorporation or these by-laws otherwise provide, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by such board, may participate in a meeting of such board or committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment whereby all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person.
Section 8. Consent of Directors. Unless otherwise restricted by the articles of incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, setting forth the action so taken, and the writing or writings are delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. Such consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the board.
Section 9. Committees. The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate from among its members one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more directors. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of such committee. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution, shall have and may exercise all of the authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation except that it shall have no authority with respect to (1) amending the articles of incorporation or these by-laws; (2) adopting a plan of merger or consolidation; (3) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the corporation; (4) a voluntary dissolution of the corporation or a revocation thereof; and (5) any other action limited by law. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as
 
may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the board of directors. A majority of each committee may determine its action and may fix the time and place of its meetings, unless otherwise provided by the board of directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the board of directors when required.
Section 10. Removal of Directors. At any shareholders meeting with respect to which notice of such purpose has been given, any director may be removed from office, with or without cause, by the vote of shareholders representing a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors, and his or her successor may be elected at the same or any subsequent meeting of shareholders; provided that to the extent any vacancy created by such removal is not filled by such an election within 60 days after such removal, the remaining directors shall, by majority vote, be entitled to fill any such vacancy.
Section 11. Compensation of Directors. Directors shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation for their services as directors or members of any committee of the board as shall be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by the board, and shall also be entitled to reimbursement for any reasonable expenses incurred in attending any meeting of the board or any such committee.
Section 1. Number. The officers of the corporation shall be chosen by the board of directors and shall be a president, a secretary and a treasurer.

Section 1. Certificates for Shares. Shares of the corporation's stock may be issued by certificate or issued without certificate as "Book Entry" shares and entered on the books of the corporation and registered as they are issued. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of

Certificates, if issued, shall be in such form as the board of directors may from time to time prescribe.
Section 2. Lost Certificates. The corporation may issue a new certificate or certificates of stock or "Book Entry" shares in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or "Book Entry" shares, the board of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her legal representative, to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Section 3. Transfers. (a) Transfers of shares of the capital stock of the corporation shall be made only on the books of the corporation by the registered holder thereof, or by his or her duly authorized attorney, or with a transfer clerk or transfer agent appointed as provided in Section 5 of this Article, and, if such shares are represented by a certificate or certificates, on surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed, or for "Book Entry" shares, upon the presentation proper evidence of authority to transfer by the record holder, and the payment of all taxes thereon.

No transfer shall affect the right of the
 
corporation to pay any dividend upon the stock to the holder of record as the holder in fact thereof for all purposes, and no transfer shall be valid, except between the parties thereto, until such transfer shall have been made upon the books of the corporation as herein provided.
(d) The board may, from time to time, make such additional rules and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these by-laws, the articles of incorporation or applicable law, rule or regulation, concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of the capital stock of the corporation.
Section 4. Record Date. In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 70 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of stockholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of shareholders, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the chose of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. If no record date is fixed for other purposes, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors shall fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

Distributions upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the articles of incorporation, if any, may be declared by the board of directors at any regular or special meetings, pursuant to law. Distributions may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation's capital stock, subject to the provisions of the articles of incorporation.
 
Before payment of any distribution, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for distributions such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing distributions, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the directors shall think conducive to the interest of the corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
Section 2. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors.

The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise. In the event it is inconvenient to use such a seal at any time, the signature of the corporation followed by the word "Seal" enclosed in parentheses shall be deemed the seal of the corporation.
Section 4. Savings Clause. To the extent these by-laws conflict with any provision of any state or federal law as such laws may be amended from time to time, these by-laws shall be construed so as not to conflict with said law, and any discretionary actions made hereunder shall be made in accordance with applicable law.
Section 1. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless any person (an "Indemnified Person") who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action or suit by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, against expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and disbursements, court costs and expert witness fees), and against any judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he or she acted in good faith and, in the case of conduct in his or her official capacity, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, and in all other cases, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to not be opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, in any case, that no indemnification shall be
 
made in respect of expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement attributable to circumstances as to which, under applicable provisions of the Code as in effect from time to time, such indemnification may not be authorized by action of the board of directors, the shareholders or otherwise.
Section 2. Indemnification of Directors and Officers for Derivative Actions. The corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless any Indemnified Person who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, against expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and disbursements, court costs and expert witness fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he or she acted in good faith and, in the case of conduct in his or her official capacity, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and in all other cases, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to not be opposed to the best interests of the corporation. No indemnification shall be made pursuant to this Section 2 for any claim, issue or matter as to which an Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the corporation, or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction shall determine upon application that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper.
Section 3. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The board of directors shall have the power to cause the corporation to provide to any person who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation all or any part of the right to indemnification and other rights of the type provided under Sections 1, 2, 6 and 12 of this Article VII (subject to the conditions, limitations, obligations and other provisions specified herein), upon a resolution to that effect identifying such employee or agent (by position or name) and specifying the particular rights provided, which may be different for each employee or agent identified. Each employee or agent of the corporation so identified shall be an "Indemnified Person" for purposes of the provisions of this Article VII.
Section 4. Subsidiaries and Other Organizations. The board of directors shall have the power to cause the corporation to provide to any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation who also is or was a director, officer, trustee, partner, employee or agent of a Subsidiary (as defined below), or is or was serving at the corporation's request in such a
 
position with any other organization, all or any part of the right to indemnification and other rights of the type provided under Sections 1, 2, 6 and 12 of this Article VII (subject to the conditions, limitations, obligations and other provisions specified herein), with respect to service by such person in such position with a Subsidiary or other organization, upon a resolution identifying such person, the Subsidiary or other organization involved (by name or other classification), and the particular rights provided, which may be different for each person so identified. Each person so identified shall be an "Indemnified Person" for purposes of the provisions of this Article VII. As used in this Article VII, "Subsidiary" shall mean (i) another corporation, joint venture, trust, partnership or unincorporated business association more than 20% of the voting capital stock or other voting equity interest of which was, at or after the time of the circumstances giving rise to such action, suit or proceeding, owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation; or (ii) a nonprofit corporation that receives its principal financial support from the corporation or its Subsidiaries.
Section 5. Determination. Notwithstanding any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or plea in any action, suit or proceeding of the kind referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VII, an Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification as provided in such Sections 1 and 2 if a determination that such Indemnified Person is entitled to such indemnification shall be made (i) if there are two or more disinterested directors, by the board of directors by a majority vote of all the disinterested directors (a majority of whom shall for such purpose constitute a quorum) or by a majority of the members of a committee of two or more disinterested directors appointed by such a vote; or (ii) in a written opinion by special legal counsel selected as required by Section 14-2-855(b)(2) of the Code or any successor provision. To the extent that an Indemnified Person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding of the kind referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
Section 6. Advances. Expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and disbursements, court costs, and expert witness fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any action, suit or proceeding of the kind described in Sections 1 and 2 hereof (or in Section 4 hereof if applicable to such Indemnified Person) may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as set forth herein, if authorized as provided herein. The corporation shall promptly pay the amount of such expenses to the Indemnified Person, but in no event later than ten days following the Indemnified Person's delivery to the corporation of a written request for an advance pursuant to this Section 6, together with a reasonable accounting of such expenses; provided,
 
however, that the Indemnified Person shall furnish the corporation a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct set forth in the Code or that the proceeding involves conduct for which liability has been eliminated under a provision of the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation, as authorized by paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of Section 14-2-202 of the Code or any successor provision, and a written undertaking and agreement, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay to the corporation any advances made pursuant to this Section 6 if it shall be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation for such amounts. The corporation shall make the advances contemplated by this Section 6 regardless of the Indemnified Person's financial ability to make repayment. Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant to this Section 6 shall be unsecured and interest-free. Authorizations under this Section 6 shall be made: (1) by the board of directors: (a) when there are two or more disinterested directors, by a majority vote of all the disinterested directors (a majority of whom shall for such purpose constitute a quorum) or by a majority of the members of a committee of two or more disinterested directors appointed by such a vote; or (b) when there are fewer than two disinterested directors, by the vote necessary for action by the board of directors in accordance with subsection (c) of Section 14-2-824 of the Code, in which authorization, directors who do not qualify as disinterested directors may participate; or (2) by the shareholders, but shares owned or voted under the control of a director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested director with respect to the proceeding may not be voted on the authorization.
Section 7. Non-Exclusivity. Subject to any applicable limitation imposed by the Code or the Articles of Incorporation, the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, resolution or agreement specifically or in general terms approved or ratified by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares entitled to be cast thereon, but shares owned or voted under the control of a director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested director, with respect to any existing or threatened proceeding that would be covered by the authorization, may not be voted on the authorization.
Section 8. Insurance. The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or who, while a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, is or was serving as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, employee or agent of a Subsidiary or, at the request of the corporation, of any other organization, against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
 
whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article VII.
Section 9. Notice. If any expenses or other amounts are paid by way of indemnification, otherwise than by court order or action by the shareholders or by an insurance carrier pursuant to insurance maintained by the corporation, the corporation shall, not later than the next annual meeting of shareholders, unless such meeting is held within three months from the date of such payment, and in any event within 15 months from the date of such payment, send by first class mail to its shareholders of record at the time entitled to vote for the election of directors a statement specifying the persons paid, the amount paid and the nature and status at the time of such payment of the litigation or threatened litigation.
Section 10. Security. The corporation may designate certain of its assets as collateral, provide self-insurance or otherwise secure its obligations under this Article VII, or under any indemnification agreement or plan of indemnification adopted and entered into in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII, as the board of directors deems appropriate.
Section 11. Amendment. Any amendment to this Article VII that limits or otherwise adversely affects the right of indemnification, advancement of expenses, or other rights of any Indemnified Person hereunder shall, as to such Indemnified Person, apply only to claims, actions, suits or proceedings based on actions, events or omissions (collectively, "Post Amendment Events") occurring after such amendment and after delivery of notice of such amendment to the Indemnified Person so affected. Any Indemnified Person shall, as to any claim, action, suit or proceeding based on actions, events or omissions occurring prior to the date of receipt of such notice, be entitled to the right of indemnification, advancement of expenses and other rights under this Article VII to the same extent as if such provisions had continued as part of the by-laws of the corporation without such amendment. This Section 11 cannot be altered, amended or repealed in a manner effective as to any Indemnified Person (except as to Post Amendment Events) without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Person.
Section 12. Agreements. In addition to the rights provided in this Article VII, the corporation shall have the power, upon authorization by the board of directors, to enter into an agreement or agreements providing to any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation indemnification rights substantially similar to, or greater than, those provided in this Article VII.
 
Section 13. Continuing Benefits. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 14. Successors. For purposes of this Article VII, the terms "the corporation" or "this corporation" shall include any corporation, joint venture, trust, partnership or unincorporated business association that is the successor to all or substantially all of the business or assets of this corporation, as a result of merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or otherwise, and any such successor shall be liable to the persons indemnified under this Article VII on the same terms and conditions and to the same extent as this corporation.
Section 15. Severability. Each of the sections of this Article VII, and each of the clauses set forth herein, shall be deemed separate and independent, and should any part of any such section or clause be declared invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall in no way render invalid or unenforceable any other part thereof or any other separate section or clause of this Article VII that is not declared invalid or unenforceable.
Section 16. Additional Indemnification. In addition to the specific indemnification rights set forth herein, the corporation shall indemnify each of its directors and officers to the full extent permitted by action of the board of directors without shareholder approval under the Code or other laws of the State of Georgia as in effect from time to time.
The board of directors shall have power to alter, amend or repeal the by-laws by majority vote of all of the directors, but any by-laws adopted by the board of directors may be altered, amended or repealed and new by-laws adopted, by the shareholders by majority vote of all of the shares having voting power.

Contact: Gilbert L. Danielson Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer 404-231-0011 Aaron Rents, Inc. Previews Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results; Revenues up 14% for Quarter; Same Store Revenues up 3.9% ATLANTA, January 22, 2008 - Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, announced today expected fourth quarter and annual financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. All data in this earnings release is preliminary and subject to audit. The Company will announce final fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 financial results on February 19, 2008. "Fiscal year 2007 was a record for us in revenues and earnings, and a year of rapid expansion in store base," said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. "Although conditions in some of our markets are currently challenging, we are confident that the products and services we offer to credit constrained consumers will continue to be in high demand in the future." For the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company preliminarily expects to record the following: - Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division revenues increased 16% and overall Company revenues increased 14% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Same store revenues in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division were up 3.9% over last year.
- Diluted earnings per share should be in the range of $.27 to $.28 per share. - The Company added a net 61 Company-operated stores and 38 franchised stores during the quarter. - New store start-up expenses were approximately $.11 per diluted share versus $.04 per share in the fourth quarter a year ago. - Overall revenues and same store revenues of Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores increased by double-digit percentages, respectively, over the fourth quarter of 2006. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. The Company preliminarily expects the following results for the twelve months of 2007: - Company revenues are up 13% to slightly below $1.5 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees). - Revenues of the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division were up 14% over last year. - The Company with its franchisees had a total store count at the end of 2007 of 1,560 stores open, an increase of 16% over the previous year. - During 2007 the Company awarded area development agreements to open a record 182 additional franchised stores and at the end of December there were a total of 284 franchised stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years. "Same store revenue growth for our Company-operated stores, although still good, was less than expected during the quarter. We have, however, made progress in reducing write-offs over the last several months," Mr. Loudermilk, Sr. continued. "The expenses incurred in expanding our store base substantially reduced profitability compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. As previously announced, we have slowed down our new store plans for 2008 and will concentrate on improving overall profitability as well as revenue growth in existing stores." "Our collective franchised stores during 2007 outperformed Company-operated stores and our priority in 2008 is to raise Company stores to a similar level of performance," Mr. Loudermilk, Sr. added. "We are also especially pleased with the demand for new franchised stores as evidenced by the record number of new area development agreements during the fiscal year."
The Company bought 646,000 shares of its Common Stock during the fourth quarter of 2007 and at its current market valuation anticipates continuing the repurchase of shares. There are currently 4,354,000 shares remaining under the Company's recent Board repurchase authorization. The Company will update first quarter and fiscal year 2008 revenue, earnings, and store growth expectations when 2007 financial results are reported on February 19. It is expected that first quarter earnings will be below that of the first quarter of 2007 due to the issues discussed above and the continuing start-up expenses of the large amount of new stores added in recent periods. The Company does expect that revenues and earnings for the entire 2008 year will again reach record levels, but in the current environment results are anticipated to be lower than the previous EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.75 per diluted share. At this time, the Company anticipates opening less than 75 new Company-operated stores in 2008 and these openings are expected to be offset somewhat by the merging or selling of stores not meeting profit goals. It is expected that 70 to 90 new franchised stores will also be opened in 2008. The Company also plans to continue to acquire franchised stores and sell Company-operated stores to franchisees as opportunities to improve profitability present themselves. Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, February 20, 2008, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronrents.com, in the "Investor Relations" section. The webcast will be archived for playback at that same site. Aaron Rents, Inc., based in Atlanta, at December 31, 2007 had 1,560 Company- operated and franchised stores in 48 states and Canada for the rental and sale of residential and office furniture, accessories, consumer electronics and household appliances. The Company also manufactures furniture, bedding and accessories at 12 facilities in five states.
"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aaron Rents, Inc.'s business which are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

ATLANTA, February 19, 2008 - Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2007, revenues increased 14% to $388.6 million compared to $339.9 million for the fourth quarter in 2006. Net earnings were $15.5 million versus $19.0 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.28 compared to $.35 per share a year ago.
 
For the year, revenues increased 13% to $1.495 billion compared to $1.327 billion for the 2006 year. Net earnings were $80.3 million versus $78.6 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $1.46 for 2007 and $1.47 in 2006.
 
We are pleased that 2007 revenues and earnings reached new records, said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. As we said in our January 22 release previewing 2007 results, the year was marked by rapid expansion in our store base as we added a net 215 new stores, a 16% increase over the previous year. The expenses of such substantial store growth reduced earnings, and we had to deal with collection issues at our Company-operated stores which resulted in many of the stores not performing at the same high level as our franchised stores.
 
 
Although new store start-up expenses will continue into 2008, we expect to see improved profit trends later in the year as we grow at a more measured rate, focusing on increasing revenues in existing stores and improving overall profitability, Mr. Loudermilk, Sr. added.
 
The Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the fourth quarter to $358.6 million, a 16% increase over the $309.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year, revenues were $1.366 billion, a 14% increase over the $1.201 billion recorded last year.
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 3.9% during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Same store revenues also increased 2.1% for Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of December 2007.
 
Consolidated rentals and fees increased 14% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 18% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the year. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 18% for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year and 17% for the year. The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and the shipments of non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $143.8 million during the fourth quarter, an 18% increase over the same quarter a year ago, and $558.9 million for the 2007 year, a 15% increase over last year. Same store revenues for franchised stores were up 15% for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc.
 
 
During the fourth quarter the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 56 new Company-operated stores and 29 new franchised stores. It also acquired 23 stores and the accounts of nine other stores from two different third party rental operators and one Aarons franchisee, which resulted in an additional 14 Company-operated stores and two franchised stores, with the remainder of the accounts of acquired stores being merged into existing Company-operated and franchised stores. During the quarter the Company also sold nine Company-operated stores to two different franchisees, and closed one franchised store. In addition, during the quarter two new Aarons Office Furniture stores were opened.

During the fourth quarter and fiscal year the Company awarded, in total, area development agreements to open 30 and 182 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of December 2007 there were 284 franchised stores awarded that are planned to be opened over the next several years.
 
At December 31, 2007 the Aarons Sales and Lease Ownership division accounted for 987 Company-operated stores, 480 franchised stores, 27 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and four franchised RIMCO stores. The Company also had 62 corporate furnishings stores. The total number of stores open at the end of 2007 was 1,560.
 
The Company generated $111 million in cash flow from operations in 2007 and expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2008. The Company may use some of this cash flow to continue repurchasing its shares as deemed warranted. There are currently 4,307,958 shares remaining under the Companys recent Board repurchase authorization.
 
In 2008 the Company expects to achieve the following:

The Company expects to increase store count, a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores, between 10% and 13% on average over the next several years. The net store growth in 2008 is expected to be somewhat less than 10%, as the Company plans to consolidate or sell some stores during the year that do not meet revenue or profit criteria.
 
Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, February 20, 2008, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen to the conference call via webcast accessible through the Companys website,

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On April 22, 2008, Aaron Rents, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2008. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release presents the Companys net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2007 excluding the gain from the sale of a parking deck at the Company's corporate headquarters.  As material real estate sales are not part of the Company's usual businesses, management believes that presentation of this particular non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it allows investors to more easily evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's core sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishings businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

ATLANTA, April 22, 2008 - Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2008.
 
For the first quarter of 2008, revenues increased 13% to $437.3 million compared to $387.9 million for the same quarter a year ago. Net earnings were $24.8 million versus $29.2 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.46 compared to $.53 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007.
 
Included in the Companys other revenues in the first quarter of 2007 was a $4.9
million gain from the sale of a parking deck at the Companys corporate headquarters. Excluding this gain, net earnings on a non-GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2007 would have been $26.2 million or $.48 per diluted share.
 
We are pleased that the first quarter exceeded our earnings expectations, said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. As previously announced we have slowed down our new store expansion plan in 2008 to concentrate on achieving better execution and improving overall profitability, and we believe the earnings results are evidence that we have started to see some positive results from this plan. Earnings in the quarter were negatively affected by start-up costs of approximately $.09 per diluted share associated with the rapid expansion of our store base throughout 2007.
 
 
 
 
 
Our franchised stores once again outperformed Company-operated stores in same store revenue growth and collection efforts, however, we are pleased that we are making progress with our Company store level execution, Mr. Loudermilk added. Net write-offs in the quarter at the Company-operated stores were lower as a percentage of revenue compared to the several previous quarters.
 
For the first quarter, the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues 16% to $406.3 million compared to $351.2 million for the first quarter last year. Same store rental revenues (rental revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 2.6% during the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007.
 
Consolidated rentals and fees increased 12% and franchise royalties and fees increased 11% during the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 22% for the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $167.4 million during the first quarter of 2008, a 13% increase over the 2007 quarter. Same store revenues for franchised stores were up 13% for the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc.
 
 
During the first quarter the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 14 new Company-operated stores, eight new franchised stores, two Company-operated RIMCO stores and two franchised RIMCO stores. The division also closed 20 Company-operated and three franchised stores during the quarter, merging their operations with other stores. In addition, the Company acquired 13 franchised stores and sold 11 Company-operated stores to franchisees. Also, during the quarter two new corporate furnishings stores were opened and two stores were closed.
 
 
2
 
 
The Company recorded a $2.3 million gain in the first quarter of 2008 relating to the sales of the Company-operated stores to franchisees. Included in operating expenses was $1.6 million for future lease obligations and other expenses related to the store closings.
 
Area development agreements were awarded during the quarter to open 50 additional franchised stores. At the end of March there were 300 franchised stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years.
 
At March 31, 2008 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division had 983 Company-operated stores, 483 franchised stores, 29 Company-operated RIMCO stores and six franchised RIMCO stores. The Company also had 62 corporate furnishings stores.
 
The Company generated over $30 million of cash flow from operations during the first quarter and bought 387,545 shares of its Common Stock. There are currently 3,920,413 shares remaining under the Companys Board repurchase authorization.
 
Our plans to open less than 75 new Company-operated and between 70 and 90 new franchised stores during 2008 are unchanged. Overall store count increased only slightly during the first quarter primarily due to closing and merging some stores not meeting our profit goals, and we will continue to do additional mergers and realignments throughout the year as deemed appropriate to improve profitability, Mr. Loudermilk continued. Our guidance for the second quarter of 2008 is to expect revenues in excess of $405 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.34 to $.39. For the entire 2008 year expectations remain to achieve Company revenues of approximately $1.7 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.40 to $1.55.
 
Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, April 23, 2008, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Companys website,

Revolving Credit Agreement
     On May 23, 2008, Aaron Rents, Inc. (the "Company") entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement by and among the Company as borrower, several banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto ("Lenders") and SunTrust Bank, in its capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders ("2008 Revolving Credit Agreement"), attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, which provides, subject to certain terms and conditions, for unsecured borrowings by the Company and the issuance of letters of credit on behalf of the Company up to an aggregate credit facility amount of $140.0 million. The 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement replaces the prior revolving credit facility (also for $140.0 million) made available pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of May 28, 2004, by and among the Company as borrower, the financial institutions party thereto as lenders, and SunTrust Bank as administrative agent, as previously amended ("Prior Revolving Facility"). The Prior Revolving Facility was terminated on May 23, 2008 concurrently with the entry into the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement.
     The 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement expires on May 23, 2013, unless terminated earlier. The 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement provides for (i) the issuance of letters of credit on behalf of the Company pursuant to a letter of credit subfacility in an aggregate amount of $10.0 million, (ii) a swingline loan subfacility in an aggregate amount of up to $15.0 million in swingline loans (each a "Swingline Loan") made available to the Company, and (iii) a revolving credit facility made available at the Company's option, with loans thereunder bearing interest at the option of the Company (in the absence of a default) at either a base rate per annum ("Base Rate Loans"), or a Eurodollar rate per annum ("Eurodollar Loans"), in each case plus an applicable margin as set forth in the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement.
     Base Rate Loans bear interest at the higher of (i) the per annum rate which the administrative agent publicly announces from time to time to be its prime lending rate, as in effect from time to time, and (ii) the Federal Funds Rate, as in effect from time to time, plus 0.50%. Eurodollar Loans bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, which is the rate per annum obtained by dividing (i) LIBOR for such interest period by (ii) a percentage equal to 1.00 minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage (which is the aggregate of the maximum reserve percentages in effect on any day to which the administrative agent is subject with respect to the Adjusted LIBO Rate), in each case, plus the applicable margin, which varies between 0.875% and 1.50% per annum based on the Company's ratio of total debt to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as determined in accordance with the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement. Swingline Loans bear interest at the rate offered for any interest period by the administrative agent and accepted by the Company. At May 29, 2008, an aggregate of $118 million (bearing interest at a weighted-average rate of 3.96%) was outstanding under the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company pays a commitment fee on unused balances. The amount of the commitment fee varies between 0.15% and 0.30% per year based on the Company's ratio of total debt to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as determined in accordance with the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement.
Interest.
 
     The Company may prepay any borrowing under the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty after giving prior notice as described in the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement; provided that prepayments of loans under the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement (other than Swingline loans) must be in an amount of at least $1 million and in multiples of $500,000.
Prepayments.
     The 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants which, among other things, forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and require the maintenance of a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under these agreements, and all amounts would become due immediately.
Covenants.
     In connection with the entry into the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement, Aaron Investment Company, a subsidiary of the Company, agreed to enter into the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement ("Subsidiary Guaranty"), attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, dated as of May 23, 2008, among the Company, Aaron Investment Company and SunTrust Bank as administrative agent for the Lenders under the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement. Under the Subsidiary Guaranty, Aaron Investment Company unconditionally guarantees as a primary obligor the due and punctual (a) payment of certain obligations under the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) performance of all covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries under the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement.

The New Franchisee Loan Facility provides for the guarantee by the Company of all loans and other obligations owing from time to time under the New Franchisee Loan Facility, compared to the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility which provided for the guarantee of 50% of losses from loans to franchisees on any given day, and also provides for the establishment of a franchisee loan facility with a maximum commitment amount of $125.0 million, under which certain independent franchisees may, subject to certain terms and conditions, obtain loans. The New Franchisee Loan Facility amended and restated the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility to, among other things, (a) extend the maturity date of the New Franchisee Loan Facility until May 23, 2009, (b) eliminate the distinction in interest rates applicable to loans made to start-up franchisees and loans made to established franchisees, (c) modify certain of the representations and warranties applicable to the Company by, among other things, increasing the dollar thresholds applicable under such representations and warranties, (d) modify the minimum consolidated net worth financial covenant applicable to the Company, (e) modify certain negative covenants applicable to the Company by, among other things, increasing the amount of certain dollar limitations in such covenants, including but not limited to, increasing the dollar limits
 
relating to (i) permitted acquisitions by the Company, (ii) the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company and its subsidiaries, (iii) sales of assets by the Company and its subsidiaries, and (iv) investments by the Company and its subsidiaries, and (f) modify certain of the events of defaults by, among other things, increasing the dollar thresholds applicable under such events.
     Under the New Franchisee Loan Facility, the Company is subject to the same financial covenants as it is under the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement, which forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and require the maintenance of a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under these agreements.
     In connection with the entry into the New Franchisee Loan Facility, Aaron Investment Company, a subsidiary of the Company, agreed to enter into the Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement ("Amended Guaranty"), attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4, dated as of May 23, 2008, in favor of the participants under the New Franchise Loan Facility and SunTrust Bank, as servicer under the New Franchisee Loan Facility, which Amended Guaranty amends and restates in its entirety the Guaranty Agreement, dated as of May 28, 2004, in favor of SunTrust Bank. Under the Amended Guaranty, Aaron Investment Company unconditionally guarantees as a primary obligor the due and punctual (a) payment of all obligations owing by the Company under the New Franchisee Loan Facility to SunTrust Bank and the participants listed in the New Franchisee Loan Facility and (b) performance of all covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities of the Company under the New Franchisee Loan Facility.
     The foregoing descriptions of the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement, the Subsidiary Guaranty, the New Franchisee Loan Facility and the Amended Guaranty, are qualified in their entirety by reference to the 2008 Revolving Credit Agreement, the Subsidiary Guaranty, the New Franchisee Loan Facility and the Amended Guaranty, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

Each Notice of Swingline Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify: (i) the principal amount of such Swingline Loan, (ii) the date of such Swingline Loan (which shall be a Business

Day) and (iii) the account of the Borrower to which the proceeds of such Swingline Loan should be credited. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of each Notice of Swingline Borrowing. Each Swingline Loan shall accrue interest at the Swingline Rate or any other interest rate as agreed between the Borrower and the Swingline Lender and shall have an Interest Period (subject to the definition thereof) as agreed between the Borrower and the Swingline Lender. The aggregate principal amount of each Swingline Loan shall be not less than $100,000 or a larger multiple of $50,000, or such other minimum amounts agreed to by the Swingline Lender and the Borrower. The Swingline Lender will make the proceeds of each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower in Dollars in immediately available funds at the account specified by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of Swingline Borrowing not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested date of such Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders on a quarterly basis if any Swingline Loans occurred during such quarter.
          (b) The Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), give a Notice of Revolving Borrowing to the Administrative Agent requesting the Lenders (including the Swingline Lender) to make Base Rate Loans in an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of any Swingline Loan. Each Lender will make the proceeds of its Base Rate Loan included in such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender in accordance with , which will be used solely for the repayment of such Swingline Loan.
Section 2.6

On the date of such required purchase, each Lender shall promptly transfer, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participating interest to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender. If such Swingline Loan bears interest at a rate other than the Base Rate, such Swingline Loan shall automatically become a Base Rate Loan on the effective date of any such participation and interest shall become payable on demand.
          (d) Each Lender's obligation to make a Base Rate Loan pursuant to () or to purchase the participating interests pursuant to () shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including without limitation (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender or any other Person may have or claim against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the existence of a Default or an Event of Default or the termination of any Lender's Revolving Commitment, (iii) the existence (or alleged existence) of any event or condition which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

In addition, such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Loans and any other amounts due to it hereunder, to the Swingline Lender to fund the amount of such Lender's participation interest in such Swingline Loans that such Lender failed to fund pursuant to this Section, until such amount has been purchased in full.

If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent together with interest at the rate specified for such Borrowing. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan if such event had not occurred at the Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable to such Eurodollar Loan for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan) over (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan for the same period if the Adjusted LIBO Rate were set on the date such Eurodollar Loan was prepaid or converted or the date on which the Borrower failed to borrow, convert or continue such Eurodollar Loan. A certificate as to any additional amount payable under this submitted to the Borrower or by any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

Upon payment by
 
any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent, all rights of such Guarantor against any Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of any Loan Party now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations.

similar requirement that takes the form of a tax) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Participant's office through which it funds its obligations hereunder shall be imposed or deemed applicable or any other condition affecting its obligation to make or maintain its Funded Participant's Interest at a rate based upon the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be imposed on any Participant or its office through which it funds its obligations hereunder or the interbank Eurodollar market; and as a result thereof there shall be any increase in the cost to such Participant of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining funds its obligations hereunder (except to the extent already included in the determination of the applicable Adjusted LIBO Rate), or there shall be a reduction in the amount received or receivable by that Participant or its office through which it funds its obligations hereunder, then the Sponsor shall from time to time, upon written notice from and demand by the Participant (with a copy of such notice and demand to the Servicer), pay to the Servicer for the account of that Participant within five Business Days after the date specified in such notice and demand, additional amounts sufficient to indemnify that Participant against such increased cost.

A certificate as to the amount of any such additional amount or amounts, submitted to the Sponsor and the Servicer by such Participant, shall, except for manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.
          (c) Each Participant agrees that, if requested by the Sponsor, it will use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Participant) to designate an alternate lending office with respect to any of its Funded Participant's Interest affected by the matters or circumstances described above to reduce the liability of the Sponsor or avoid the results provided thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Participant as determined by such Participant, which determination if made in good faith, shall
 
be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto. Nothing in this Section 2.10(c) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Sponsor or any right of any Participant provided hereunder.

In addition, if the Sponsor takes over the operation of the business of an Established Franchisee Borrower as provided in Section 4.3, the Servicer shall refrain from exercising remedies against such Borrower for as long as the Sponsor is complying with Section 4.3, unless a Credit Event has occurred and is continuing or the Required Participants otherwise agree.

The Sponsor will immediately deliver such releases, acknowledgments and other documents as the Servicer may require in connection therewith.

Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Loan Facility Agreement.
Loan Facility Agreement
Participants
Servicer
Guaranteed Parties
     The Participants have agreed to provide lines of credit to Franchisees of the Sponsor pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Loan Facility Agreement. Each of the Guarantors is a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Sponsor and acknowledges that it will derive substantial benefit from the Loan Facility Agreement. The obligations of the Participants to make Loans are conditioned on, among other things, the execution and delivery by the Guarantors of an Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement in the form hereof. As consideration therefor and in order to induce the Participants to make Loans, the Guarantors are willing to execute this Agreement.
     Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     SECTION 1. . Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, (a) the due and punctual payment of all obligations owing by the Sponsor to the Guaranteed Parties, including fees, costs, expenses and indemnities, whether primary, secondary, direct, contingent, fixed or otherwise (including monetary obligations incurred during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such proceeding), under the Loan Facility Agreement and the other Operative Documents and (b) the due and punctual performance of all covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor under or pursuant to the Loan Facility Agreement and the other Operative Documents (all the monetary and other obligations referred to in the preceding clauses (a) and (b) being collectively called the ""). Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
Guarantee
Obligations
     SECTION 2. . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Sponsor of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and
Obligations Not Waived
 
notice of protest for nonpayment. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against the Sponsor or any other Guarantor under the provisions of the Loan Facility Agreement, any other Operative Document or otherwise, (b) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Agreement, any other Operative Document, any Guarantee or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement, or (c) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of any Guaranteed Parties.
     SECTION 3. . Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Guaranteed Party to any of the security held for payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Guaranteed Party in favor of the Sponsor or any other person.
Guarantee of Payment
     SECTION 4. . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Loan Facility Agreement, any other Operative Document or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to the extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of each Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).
No Discharge or Diminishment of Guarantee
     SECTION 5. . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Sponsor or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Sponsor, other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. The Guaranteed Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Sponsor or any other guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully, finally and indefeasibly paid in cash. Pursuant to applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Sponsor or any other Guarantor or guarantor, as the case may be, or any security.
Defenses of Borrower Waived
 
     SECTION 6. . In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that any Guaranteed Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Credit Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Servicer for the benefit of the Participants in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Servicer, all rights of such Guarantor against the Sponsor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of the Sponsor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Guarantor on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of the Sponsor, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Servicer to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Operative Documents.
Agreement to Pay; Subordination
     SECTION 7. . Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Sponsor's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Guaranteed Parties will have any duty to advise any of the Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
Information
     SECTION 8. . Each Guarantor represents and warrants as to itself that all representations and warranties relating to it (as a Subsidiary of the Sponsor) contained in the Loan Facility Agreement are true and correct.
Representations and Warranties
     SECTION 9. . The guarantees made hereunder (a) shall terminate when all the Obligations have been paid in full in cash and the Participants have no further commitment to lend under the Loan Facility Agreement and (b) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Participant or any Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Credit Party or otherwise. In connection with the foregoing, the Servicer shall execute and deliver to such Guarantor or Guarantor's designee, at such Guarantor's expense, any documents or instruments which such Guarantor shall reasonably request from time to time to evidence such termination and release.
Termination
     SECTION 10. . Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Guarantors that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Guarantor
Binding Effect; Several Agreement; Assignments
 
shall have been delivered to the Servicer, and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Servicer, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and the Servicer and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Guarantor, the Guaranteed Parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment shall be void). If all of the capital stock of a Guarantor is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a transaction permitted by the Loan Facility Agreement, such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement without further action. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder.
     SECTION 11. . (a) No failure or delay of the Servicer if any in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and of the Servicer hereunder and of the Participants under the other Operative Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver and consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice in similar or other circumstances.
Waivers; Amendment
     (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the Guarantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification relates and the Servicer, with the prior written consent of the Required Participants (except as otherwise provided in the Loan Facility Agreement).
     SECTION 12. . THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF).

Survival of Agreement; Severability
 
Parties and shall survive the making by the Participants of the Loans regardless of any investigation made by any of them or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any other fee or amount payable under this Agreement or any other Operative Document is outstanding and unpaid and as long as the Commitments have not been terminated.
     (b) In the event one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
     SECTION 15. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

The execution and delivery of any instrument adding an additional Guarantor as a party to this Agreement shall not require the consent of any other Guarantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Guarantor as a party to this Agreement.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 22, 2008, Aaron Rents, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the second quarter of 2008. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release presents the Company's net earnings and diluted earnings per share from the second quarter of 2008 to the comparable period in 2007 excluding the gain from the sales of stores in 2008. As dispositions of a significant number of stores to a single purchaser are not common occurrences in the Company's businesses, management believes that presentation of these particular non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow investors to more easily evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's core sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishings businesses from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: July 22, 2008
 

 
 
ATLANTA, July 22, 2008 - Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2008.
 
For the second quarter of 2008, revenues rose 15% to $411.2 million compared to $359.0 million for the second quarter of 2007. Net earnings were $23.3 million versus $19.7 million for the same period a year ago, an 18% increase. Diluted earnings per share were up 19% to $.43 compared to $.36 per share last year.
 
For the first six months of this year, revenues were up 14% to $848.5 million compared to $746.9 million for the first six months of 2007. Net earnings for the first half of 2008 were $48.0 million versus $48.9 million for the corresponding period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first six months were $.89 for both 2008 and 2007.
 
Included in the Companys other revenues in the second quarter of 2008 was a $3.4 million gain from the sale of four Company-operated stores to a franchisee and the rental accounts of three stores to a third party operator. Excluding this gain, net earnings on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2008 would have been $21.2 million, or $.39 per diluted share. The Company also recorded a $2.3 million gain included in other revenues in the first quarter of 2008 relating to the sale of Company-operated stores to franchisees. Included in the Companys other revenues in the first six months of 2007 was a $4.9 million gain from the sale in last years first quarter of a parking deck at the Companys corporate headquarters. See the attached table for a reconciliation of revenues, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share to non-GAAP revenues, earnings, and diluted earnings per share excluding the aforementioned asset sales.
 
 
 
 
 
We feel our second quarter results are exceptional, said R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., Chairman of Aaron Rents. The Company continues to grow and we are pleased that we service the large market of credit-constrained consumers who need and desire our products and services even in these difficult economic times.
 
Our goal is to continue to grow the business and at the same time increase profitability, added Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. In the second quarter we saw an improvement in same store revenues, collection efforts and overall store level execution, and our profitability exceeded expectations. Earnings for the quarter were positively impacted by better performance even with the start-up expenses associated with the opening of new stores negatively impacting results by approximately $.06 per diluted share.
 
Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division second quarter revenues increased 16% to $381.4 million compared to $327.6 million last year. First six months sales and lease ownership revenues also increased 16% to $787.7 million compared to the $678.8 million of a year ago.
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 4.1% during the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same quarter a year ago.
 
Consolidated rentals and fees for the second quarter and first half advanced 14% and 13% over the comparable previous year periods, respectively. In addition, franchise royalties and fees were up 13% for the second quarter and 12% year-to-date. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased to $66.1 million for the second quarter from $56.7 million in the comparable period in 2007 and to $151.5 million for the first six months compared to $126.9 million for the first six months last year. The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and the shipments of non-retail sales are the result of the increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $160.3 million during the second quarter and $327.7 million for the first six months of 2008, an 18% and 15% increase, respectively, over the prior year periods. Same store revenues for franchised stores were up 16.1% for the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc.
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the second quarter the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened six new Company-operated stores, 14 new franchised stores, one Company-operated RIMCO store and one franchised RIMCO store. The division also closed nine Company-operated and four franchised stores during the quarter, merging their operations with other existing stores. In addition, the Company acquired 17 franchised stores, acquired one store and the rental accounts of six other stores from unrelated rental companies, sold four Company-operated stores to a franchisee, and sold the rental accounts of three other stores to another rental operator. The Company also closed two corporate furnishings stores during the quarter.
 
Through the three months and six months ended June 30, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 29 and 79 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of June there were a total of 285 franchised stores awarded that are expected to open over the next several years.
 
At June 30, 2008 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division had 993 Company-operated stores, 480 franchised stores, 30 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and seven franchised RIMCO stores. In addition, the Company operated 60 corporate furnishings stores.
 
During the first six months of 2008 we have continued to open new stores but also have bought and sold numerous stores in transactions with franchisees as well as closing a total of 29 Company-operated and seven franchised stores, merging their operations with other stores. These actions were done to improve profitability and we will continue to evaluate the need for additional mergers and realignments throughout the year, Mr. Loudermilk, Jr. continued.
 
As a result of these realignment efforts, we anticipate that we will now open approximately 55 to 65 new Company-operated stores and 55 to 65 new franchised stores this year, a somewhat smaller number than previously forecasted. Our guidance for the third quarter of 2008 is to expect revenues in excess of $405 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $.32 to $.37. For the entire 2008 year we continue to expect Company revenues of approximately $1.7 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and are raising our previous diluted earnings per share range of guidance of $1.40 to $1.55 for the year to $1.54 to $1.64, primarily due to the improving trends in our performance and market opportunity. We anticipate a 10% to 13% overall store square footage growth in 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
Aaron Rents will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, July 23, 2008, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Companys website,
www.aaronrents.com

As previously announced, the Company has entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its Aarons Corporate Furnishings division. Beginning with the results reported in this release, the Company no longer includes the revenues and expenses of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division on the Companys statement of earnings, and reports net earnings of the division as discontinued operations. Prior periods are restated to reflect this change in accounting treatment and the assets of the division will be reflected as assets held for sale on the Companys balance sheet until the transaction closes.
 
For the third quarter of 2008, revenues increased 16% to $388.0 million compared to $333.7 million for the same period a year ago. Net earnings rose 32% to $21.1 million versus the $15.9 million recorded in the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.39 compared to $.29 per share in 2007, a 34% increase.
 
 
 
For the first nine months of this year, revenues advanced 15% to $1.188 billion compared to $1.030 billion for the same period of 2007. Net earnings for the nine months were up 7% to $69.1 million versus $64.8 million for the corresponding period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months increased 8% to $1.28 for 2008 versus $1.18 for 2007.
 
For the third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 42% over the same period in 2007 and 12% for the comparable nine month period.
 
We are very pleased with the third quarter results from both our Company-operated and franchised stores, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents. Even though economic times are tough and our stores in the southern and central United States were affected in September by business disruption and property damage as a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, we still managed to have an outstanding quarter as customers continue to come into our stores seeking basic home furnishings.
 
Our same store revenue growth accelerated in the quarter and margins improved, even though over 100 of our stores were adversely impacted by the hurricanes, continued Mr. Loudermilk. Although difficult to estimate, we feel that the hurricanes negatively affected earnings in the quarter by at least $.01 to $.02 per diluted share, including the value of our merchandise that was destroyed in the homes of our customers. In addition, start up expenses associated with new stores also reduced third quarter earnings by approximately $.05 per share. We feel we are in an outstanding position to continue the growth of our business during the remainder of 2008 and on into 2009.
 
The Companys other revenues in the third quarter of 2008 included a $2.6 million gain from the sale of 11 Company-operated stores to three different franchisees. Excluding this gain, net earnings on a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2008 would have been $19.5 million, or $.36 per diluted share. The Company has realized a total of $8.4 million in gains in other revenues during the first nine months of 2008 relating to similar store sales. The Companys other revenues in the first nine months of 2007 included a $4.9 million gain from the sale of a parking deck at the Companys corporate headquarters in last years first quarter. See the attached table for a reconciliation of revenues, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share to non-GAAP revenues, earnings, and diluted earnings per share excluding the aforementioned asset sales.
 
 
 
Revenues in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division in the third quarter increased 17% to $382.6 million compared to $328.1 million last year. The first nine months sales and lease ownership revenues went up 16% to $1.170 billion compared to $1.007 billion a year ago.
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased 5.7% during the third quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of last year.
 
On September 15, 2008, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its Aarons Corporate Furnishings division to CORT Business Services Corporation and to transfer certain liabilities of the division to CORT. As consideration for the sale, the Company anticipates receiving approximately $72 million in cash plus payments for certain accounts receivable, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to customary closing conditions, it is anticipated that the transaction will close in November. It is not expected that the Company will record a material gain or loss on the sale.
 
The Aarons Corporate Furnishings division revenues, which are not included in the Companys revenues, declined 4% during the third quarter to $24.6 million compared to $25.7 million a year ago. Corporate furnishings revenues were $73.5 million for the nine months compared to $76.0 million in 2007, a 3% decrease. After the sale of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division, the Company will continue with the operations of the Aarons Office Furniture division.
 
Consolidated rentals and fees increased 13% for both the third quarter and first nine months compared to the previous year periods. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 25% for the third quarter and 16% year-to-date compared to the same periods a year ago. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of rental merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 22% to $70.7 million for the third quarter from $58.1 million in the comparable period in 2007, and 20% to $222.2 million for the first nine months compared to $185.0 million for the same period last year. The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of the increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $166.0 million for the third quarter and $493.7 million for the first nine months of 2008, a 26% and 19% increase, respectively, over the comparable prior year periods. Same store revenues for franchised stores were up18.4% for the third quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc.
 
 
 
 
During the third quarter the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened four new Company-operated stores, 12 new franchised stores, and one franchised RIMCO store. The Company sold 11 Company-operated sales and lease ownership stores to franchisees, and closed four Company-operated sales and lease ownership stores. In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired one franchised store and purchased the accounts of three third party stores.
 
For the three months and nine months ended September 30, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 46 and 125 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of September there were a total of 303 franchised stores awarded that we expect will open over the next several years.
 
At September 30 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division had open 983 Company-operated stores and 502 franchised stores, 30 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and eight franchised RIMCO stores. In addition, the Company operated 47 Aarons Corporate Furnishings stores and 13 Aarons Office Furniture stores. The total number of stores open at the end of September was 1,583.
 
We anticipate in the fourth quarter of 2008 to have revenues in excess of $410 million and diluted earnings per share between $0.32 to $0.37, Mr. Loudermilk added. For the 2008 fiscal year we anticipate Company revenues to be approximately $1.6 billion (excluding revenues of franchisees) and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, excluding any gain or loss recorded on the sale of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division. By the end of 2008 we expect to have approximately 1,600 Company-operated and franchised stores open. We continue to expect to increase the store base 10% to 13% over the next several years, for the most part an equal mix between Company-operated and franchised stores. Our initial earnings guidance for 2009 is to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.65 to $1.80.

ITEM 7.01.  REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
On December 22, 2008, Aaron Rents, Inc. issued a press release updating its earnings guidance and store growth projections for 2009.  The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
(d)           Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
ATLANTA, December 22, 2008  Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, today announced that business trends continue to be quite positive and that it was raising its 2009 earnings guidance.
 
Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership results continue to be strong with growing same store revenues and customer counts, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron Rents.  Unlike many other specialty retailers, our business has been thriving in this economic environment.  We give customers the ability to obtain necessary home furnishings through non-credit based lease plans not available to them at traditional retail outlets.
 
As previously announced, during the fourth quarter the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Rosey Rentals, L.P., its second largest franchisee with 35 stores in six states.  In addition, during the quarter the Company has purchased the accounts of 18 stores from several competitors, as well as buying one store and selling 11 stores to other operators.  The Company also has merged 20 of its RIMCO stores into existing Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership stores and is re-evaluating the wheels and rims concept.  After the opening of new stores and these store re-alignments, the Company is now expecting to have approximately 1,045 Company-operated stores and 500 franchised stores open by the end of 2008.
 
 
 
 
 
We expect same store revenues for the fourth quarter to increase 5% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, Mr. Loudermilk continued.  Our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 is unchanged, with diluted earnings per share for the year expected to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, excluding gains from fourth quarter store sales and any gain or loss on the previous announced sale of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division.
 
We are altering our 2009 square footage growth plans somewhat, and expect to increase overall store growth next year approximately 5% to 9% over the store base at the end of 2008. This will be net store growth after opening a combination of Company-operated and franchised stores, less any opportunistic merging or disposition of stores.  This rate of growth should allow us to improve margins as well as fund our expansion without the need to seek additional sources of capital.  Due to the current strength of our business and our outlook for next year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for 2009 from previously expecting to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.65 to $1.80 to now expecting $1.70 to $1.85 per share.
 
Aaron Rents will announce its fourth quarter earnings on Monday, February 16, 2009 and will hold a conference call to discuss the financial results on Tuesday, February 17, 2009, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Companys website, , in the Investor Relations section.  The webcast will be archived for playback at that same site.

Aaron Rents, Inc., based in Atlanta, currently has more than 1,535 Company- operated and franchised stores in 48 states and Canada.  The Companys MacTavish Furniture Industries division manufactured approximately $73 million at cost of furniture and bedding at 12 facilities in five states in 2007.  The entire production of MacTavish is for shipment to Aaron Rents stores.
 
Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aaron Rents, Inc.s business which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

As previously reported, on September 15, 2008, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its Aarons Corporate Furnishings division to CORT Business Services Corporation and to transfer certain liabilities of the division to CORT. The Company consummated the sale in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company will no longer include the revenues and expenses of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division on the Companys statement of earnings, and will instead report net earnings of the business as discontinued operations in future financial statements.  Prior periods have been restated to reflect this change in accounting treatment and the assets of the business were reflected as assets held for sale on the Companys balance sheet until the transaction closed.

     The Board of Directors unanimously adopted a comprehensive amendment and restatement of the 2001 Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan (the "Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan") on February 24, 2009, subject to shareholder approval. The Board has submitted the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan for approval by the Company's shareholders at the Company's annual meeting on May 5, 2009. The Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan, if approved by the shareholders, will be effective as of February 24, 2009, and will remain in effect until February 23, 2019, unless it is terminated by the Board at an earlier date.
     The following description of certain material features of the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Description of the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan
     Awards granted under the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan may be "incentive stock options" ("ISOs"), as defined in Section 422 of the Code; "nonqualified stock options" ("NQSOs"); shares of the Company's Common Stock, or units which represent the right to obtain shares of Common Stock, which may be nontransferable and/or forfeitable under restrictions, terms and conditions set forth in the award agreement ("restricted stock" or "stock awards," or in the case of units, "restricted stock units" or "RSUs"); stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); performance shares; or performance units. ISOs may be granted only to employees of the Company, including officers. All other stock incentives, including NQSOs, may be granted to any person employed by or performing services for the Company, including non-employee directors, independent contractors, consultants and advisors who provide certain bona fide services to the Company.
     The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") or its designee has the right to set the terms and conditions of grants and awards, including the term, exercise price, vesting conditions (including vesting based on the Company's performance or upon share price performance), and consequences of termination of employment; to select the persons who receive such grants and awards; and to interpret and administer the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan. The number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan is a maximum of 7,850,000 shares (an increase of five million shares from the number of shares previously approved by the Company's shareholders for issuance under the 2001 Stock Award Plan), subject to anti-dilution and similar
 
 
provisions. All of the shares available for issuance under the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan may be issued pursuant to ISOs. The maximum aggregate number of shares for which options (ISOs and NQSOs) and SARs may be granted to any individual during any calendar year is 400,000 shares, subject to anti-dilution and similar provisions. The maximum aggregate number of shares of restricted stock and RSUs that may be granted to any individual during any calendar year is also 400,000 shares, subject to anti-dilution and similar provisions. With respect to performance awards that have a specific dollar-value target or are performance units, the maximum aggregate payout (determined as of the end of the applicable performance cycle) with respect to performance awards granted in any one calendar year to any one participant shall be $2,000,000. With respect to performance awards that are payable in shares, the maximum aggregate payout (determined as of the end of the applicable performance cycle) with respect to performance awards that may be granted to any individual during any calendar year is also 400,000 shares, subject to anti-dilution and similar provisions. The Board of Directors or the Committee may at any time amend or terminate the Restated 2001 Stock Award Plan, subject to applicable laws.

     (a) Subject to adjustment as provided in (b) below and in Section 4.3, the aggregate number of Shares that are available for issuance pursuant to Awards under the Plan is seven million eight hundred fifty thousand (7,850,000) Shares. All of the Shares available for issuance under the Plan may be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options. If Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or other Awards are issued in respect of options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other equity awards of an entity acquired, by merger or otherwise, by the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company or any Employer), to the extent such issuance shall not be inconsistent with the terms, limitations and conditions of Code Section 422 or Exchange Act Rule 16b-3, the aggregate number of Shares for which Awards may be made hereunder shall automatically be increased by the number of Shares subject to Awards so issued. Such Shares shall be made available from Shares currently authorized but unissued or Shares currently held (or subsequently acquired) by the Company as treasury shares, including Shares purchased in the open market or in private transactions.
     (b) The following rules shall apply for purposes of the determination of the number of Shares available for grant under the Plan:
     (i) If, for any reason, any Shares awarded or subject to purchase under the Plan are not delivered or purchased, or are reacquired by the Company, for reasons including, but not limited to, a forfeiture of Restricted Stock, an exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right with the delivery of fewer Shares than are subject to the Stock Appreciation Right, or termination, expiration or cancellation of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Shares or
 
Performance Units, such Shares (the "Returned Shares") shall not be charged against, or if previously charged against, shall be added back to, the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance pursuant to Awards under the Plan. If the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligation under an Award is satisfied by tendering Shares to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) or by reducing the number of Shares to be delivered to the Participant, only the number of Shares issued net of the Shares so tendered or withheld shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.
     (ii) Each Share subject to a Stock Award shall be counted as one Share subject to an Award. Each RSU and each Performance Share awarded that may be settled in Shares shall be counted as one Share subject to an Award. Each Performance Unit awarded that may be settled in Shares shall be counted as a number of Shares subject to an award, with the number determined by dividing the value of the Performance Unit at grant by the Fair Market Value of a Share at Grant. Performance Shares and Units and RSUs that may not be settled in Shares shall not result in a charge against the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance pursuant to Awards under this Plan.
     (iii) Each Stock Appreciation Right that may be settled in Shares shall be counted as one Share subject to an award. Stock Appreciation Rights that may not be settled in Shares shall not result in a charge against the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance. In addition, if a Stock Appreciation Right is granted in connection with an Option and the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right results in the loss of the Option right, the Shares that otherwise would have been issued upon the exercise of such related Option shall not result in a charge against the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance pursuant to Awards under this Plan. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, only the actual number of Shares delivered shall be charged against the aggregate number of Shares available, and any additional Shares that were the subject of the Stock Appreciation Right shall be added back to aggregate number of Shares available for issuance and shall again be available for the grant of Awards.
     4.2 . Except to the extent the Committee determines that an Award to a Named Executive Officer shall not comply with the performance-based compensation provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, the following rules shall apply to Awards under the Plan:

With respect to Performance Awards that are payable in Shares, the maximum aggregate payout (determined as of the end of the applicable performance cycle) with respect to Performance Awards granted in any calendar year to any one Participant shall be four hundred thousand (400,000) Shares.
Performance Awards
     4.3 . If any change in corporate capitalization, such as a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, or any corporate transaction such as a reorganization, reclassification, merger or consolidation or separation, including a spin-off, of the Company or sale or other disposition by the Company of all or a portion of its assets, any other change in the Company's corporate structure, or any distribution to shareholders (other than a cash dividend) results in the outstanding Shares, or any securities exchanged therefor or received in their place, being exchanged for a different number or class of shares or other securities of the Company, or for shares of stock or other securities of any other corporation; or new, different or additional shares or other securities of the Company or of any other corporation being received by the holders of outstanding Shares; then equitable adjustments shall be made by the Committee, as it determines are necessary and appropriate, in:
Adjustment of Shares
     (a) the limitations on the aggregate number of Shares that may be awarded as set forth in Section 4.1, including, without limitation, with respect to Incentive Stock Options;
     (b) the limitations on the aggregate number of Shares that may be awarded to any one single Participant as set forth in Section 4.2;
     (c) the number and class of Shares that may be subject to an Award, and that have not been issued or transferred under an outstanding Award;
     (d) the Option Price under outstanding Options and the number of Shares to be transferred in settlement of outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights; and
     (e) the terms, conditions or restrictions of any Award and Agreement, including the price payable for the acquisition of Shares; provided, however, that, to the extent possible, all such adjustments made in respect of each ISO shall be accomplished so that such Option shall continue to be an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
     5.1 . Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, Options may be granted to Eligible Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have sole discretion in determining the number of Shares subject to Options granted to each Participant. The Committee may grant a Participant ISOs, NQSOs or a combination thereof, and may vary such Awards among Participants; provided that only an employee of the Employer may be granted ISOs.
Grant of Options
 
     5.2 . Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Agreement that shall specify the Option Exercise Price, the duration of the Option, the number of Shares to which the Option pertains and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine. The Option Agreement shall further specify whether the Award is intended to be an ISO or an NQSO. Any portion of an Option that is not designated in the Agreement as an ISO or otherwise fails or is not qualified as an ISO (even if designated as an ISO) shall be an NQSO. The Committee may provide in the Option Agreement for transfer restrictions, repurchase rights, vesting requirements and other limitations on the Shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option.
Agreement
     5.3 . The Option Exercise Price for each grant of an ISO shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted. The Option Exercise Price for each grant of a NQSO shall be established by the Committee and, in its discretion, may be less than, equal to or more than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted. Any Option granted with an Option Exercise Price less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant shall include terms and conditions intended to be ensure that the Option is exempt from or complies with Code Section 409A.
Option Exercise Price
     5.4 . Each Option shall expire at such time as the Committee shall determine at the time of grant; provided, however, that no Option shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10) anniversary of its grant date.
Duration of Options
th
     5.5 . Options granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall in each instance approve, including, without limitation, conditions related to the employment of or provision of services by the Participant with the Company or any Employer, which need not be the same for each grant or for each Participant. The Committee may provide in the Agreement for automatic accelerated vesting and other rights upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company or upon the occurrence of other events as specified in the Agreement.
Exercise of Options
     5.6 . Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise to the Company, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares (less any amount previously paid by the Participant to acquire the Option). The Option Exercise Price upon exercise of any Option shall be payable to the Company in full, in any of the following manners: (a) in cash, (b) in cash equivalent approved by the Committee, (c) unless not permitted by the Committee, by tendering previously acquired Shares (or delivering a certification or attestation of ownership of such Shares) having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Exercise Price (provided that the tendered Shares must have been held by the Participant for six months or such other period required by the Committee), (d) unless not permitted by the Committee, by having the Company withhold Shares from the Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Exercise Price, or (e) by a combination of (a), (b), (c) and (d). The Committee also may allow cashless exercises as permitted under Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T, subject to applicable securities law restrictions, or by any other means which the Committee determines to be consistent with the Plan's purpose and applicable law.
Payment
 
     5.7 .
Nontransferability of Options
     (a) . No ISO granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, all ISOs granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant.
Incentive Stock Options
     (b) . Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement consistent with securities and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, no NQSO granted under this Article 5 may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement, all NQSOs granted to a Participant under this Article 5 shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant. In the event of a transfer permitted by the Agreement, appropriate evidence of any transfer to the Permitted Transferees shall be delivered to the Company at its principal executive office. If all or part of an Option is transferred to a Permitted Transferee, the Permitted Transferee's rights thereunder shall be subject to the same restrictions and limitations with respect to the Option as the Participant, and any reference in the Option Agreement to the employment by or performance of services for the Company by the Participant shall continue to refer to the employment of, or performance of services by, the Participant who transferred the Option.
Nonqualified Stock Options
     5.8 . Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall any Participant who owns (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code) stock of the Company possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company be eligible to receive an ISO at an Option Exercise Price less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the ISO is granted or be eligible to receive an ISO that is exercisable later than the fifth (5th) anniversary date of its grant. No Participant may be granted ISOs (under the Plan and all other incentive stock option plans of the Employer) which are first exercisable in any calendar year for Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date an Option is granted) that exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Any such excess shall instead automatically be treated as a NQSO.
Special Rules for ISOs
     6.1 . A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to an Eligible Participant in connection with an Option granted under Article 5 of this Plan or may be granted independently of any Option. A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the holder, within the specified period (which may not exceed 10 years), to exercise the SAR and receive in exchange therefor a payment having an aggregate value equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value of a Share on the exercise date exceeds the specified purchase price (which, unless provided otherwise, shall be the Fair Market Value on the grant date), times the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. The Committee may provide in
Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights (or SARs)
 
the Agreement for automatic exercise on a certain date, for payment of the proceeds on a certain date, and/or for accelerated vesting and other rights upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or upon the occurrence of other events specified in the Agreement. A SAR granted in connection with an Option (a "") shall entitle the holder of the related Option, within the period specified for the exercise of the Option, to surrender the unexercised Option, or a portion thereof, and to receive in exchange therefore a payment having an aggregate value equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value of a Share on the exercise date exceeds the Option Exercise Price per Share, times the number of Shares subject to the Option, or portion thereof, which is surrendered. SARs shall be subject to the same transferability restrictions as Nonqualified Stock Options.
Tandem SAR
     6.2 . Each SAR grant shall be evidenced by an Agreement that shall specify the exercise price, the duration of the SAR, the number of Shares to which the SAR pertains and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine.
Agreement
     6.3 . Each Tandem SAR shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the related Option, including limitations on transferability, and shall be exercisable only to the extent such Option is exercisable and shall terminate or lapse and cease to be exercisable when the related Option terminates or lapses. The grant of Stock Appreciation Rights related to ISOs must be concurrent with the grant of the ISOs. With respect to NQSOs, the grant either may be concurrent with the grant of the NQSOs, or in connection with NQSOs previously granted under Article 5, which are unexercised and have not terminated or lapsed.
Tandem SARs
     6.4 . The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine in each Agreement whether the payment with respect to the exercise of an SAR will be in the form of all cash, all Shares, or any combination thereof. If payment is to be made in Shares, the number of Shares shall be determined based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise or the date of payment, as applicable. If the Committee elects to make full payment in Shares, no fractional Shares shall be issued and cash payments shall be made in lieu of fractional Shares. The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine and set forth in the Agreement the timing of any payment made in cash or Shares, or a combination thereof, upon exercise of SARs, including whether payment will be made in a lump sum, in annual installments or otherwise deferred; and the Committee shall have sole discretion to determine and set forth in the Agreement whether any deferred payments may bear amounts equivalent to interest or cash dividends.
Payment
     6.5 . Upon exercise of a Tandem SAR, the number of Shares subject to exercise under any related Option shall automatically be reduced by the number of Shares represented by the Option or portion thereof which is surrendered.
Exercise of SARs
     7.1 . Stock Awards and Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") may be made to Eligible Participants as a reward for past service or as an incentive for the performance of future services that will contribute materially to the successful operation of the Employer. Stock Awards and Awards of Restricted Stock and RSUs may be made either alone or in addition to or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan and may be current grants of Restricted Stock and RSUs or deferred grants of Stock Awards or Restricted Stock and RSUs.
Grant of Stock Awards, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
 
     7.2 . The Restricted Stock Agreement shall set forth the terms of the Restricted Stock Award, as determined by the Committee, including, without limitation, the purchase price, if any, to be paid for such Restricted Stock, which may be zero, subject to such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law; any restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock such as continued service or achievement of performance goals; the length of the Restriction Period, if any, and whether any circumstances, such as death, Disability, or a Change in Control, will shorten or terminate the Restriction Period; and rights of the Participant to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Shares during the Restriction Period.
Restricted Stock Agreement
     7.3 . The Restricted Stock Unit Agreement shall set forth the terms of the RSU Award, as determined by the Committee, including without limitation, the number of RSUs granted to the Participant; the restrictions, terms and conditions of the RSU; whether the RSU will be settled in cash, Shares, or a combination of the two and the date when the RSU will be settled; any requirements such as continued service or achievement of certain performance measures; the length of the Restriction Period, if any; whether any circumstances such as Change in Control, termination of employment, Disability or death will shorten or terminate any vesting or Restriction Period; and whether dividend equivalents will be paid or accrued with respect to the RSUs.
Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
     7.4 . Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement, no RSUs and no Shares of Restricted Stock received by a Participant shall be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of during the Restriction Period.
Nontransferability
     7.5 . Upon an Award of Restricted Stock to a Participant, Shares of Restricted Stock shall be registered in the Participant's name. Certificates, if issued, may either be held in custody by the Company until the Restriction Period expires or until restrictions thereon otherwise lapse and/or be issued to the Participant and registered in the name of the Participant, bearing an appropriate restrictive legend and remaining subject to appropriate stop-transfer orders. If required by the Committee, the Participant shall deliver to the Company one or more stock powers endorsed in blank relating to the Restricted Stock. Upon grant of a Stock Award, settlement of an RSU in Shares, and with respect to Restricted Stock, if and when the Restriction Period expires without a prior forfeiture of the Restricted Stock subject to such Restriction Period, unrestricted certificates for such shares shall be delivered to the Participant or registered in the Participant's name on the Company's records; provided, however, that the Committee may cause such legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates as it may deem advisable under the terms of the Plan and the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any applicable federal or state law. The Company shall not be required to deliver any fractional Share but will pay, in lieu thereof, the Fair Market Value (determined as of the date the restrictions lapse for Restricted Stock or the RSU is settled) of such fractional Share to the holder thereof. Concurrently with the grant of an unrestricted Stock Award, the settlement of an RSU or the lapse of any risk of forfeiture applicable to the Restricted Stock, the Participant shall be required to pay an amount necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local tax requirements as set out in Article 12 below.
Certificates
 
     7.6 . Except as provided in this Article 7 or in the Award Agreement, a Participant receiving a Restricted Stock Award shall have, with respect to such Restricted Stock Award, all of the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including the right to vote the Shares to the extent, if any, such Shares possess voting rights and the right to receive any dividends; provided, however, the Committee may require that any dividends on such Shares of Restricted Stock shall be automatically deferred and reinvested in additional Restricted Stock subject to the same restrictions as the underlying Award, or may require that dividends and other distributions on Restricted Stock shall be paid to the Company for the account of the Participant. The Committee shall determine whether interest shall be paid on such amounts, the rate of any such interest, and the other terms applicable to such amounts.
Dividends and Other Distributions
     8.1 . Performance Shares, Performance Units or both may be granted to Participants in such amounts and upon such terms, and at any time and from time to time, as shall be determined by the Committee.
Grant of Performance Shares/Units
     8.2 . Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established by the Committee at the time of grant. Each Performance Share shall have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. The Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or value of Performance Shares, Performance Units or both that will be paid out to the Participant. For purposes of this Article 8, the time period during which the performance goals must be met shall be called a "Performance Period." Performance Periods shall generally equal or exceed two (2) years in length. For Awards intended to qualify under the performance-based compensation provisions of Code Section 162(m), the performance goals shall be established at the beginning of the Performance Period within the time period as is permitted by Code Section 162(m).
Value of Performance Shares/Units
     8.3 . Subject to the terms of this Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Shares/Units shall be entitled to receive a payout of the number and value of Performance Shares/Units earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.
Earning of Performance Shares/Units
     8.4 . Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Shares/Units in the form of cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof) which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Shares/Units at the close of the applicable Performance Period. Such Shares may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee. The determination of the Committee with respect to the form and timing of payout of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award and, for Awards intended to qualify under the performance-based compensation provisions of Code Section 162(m), shall meet the requirements of Code Section 162(m).
Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Shares/Units
 
     Except as otherwise provided in the Participant's Award Agreement, a Participant shall be entitled to receive any dividends declared with respect to Shares earned in connection with earned grants of Performance Shares/Units, that have not yet been distributed to the Participant (such dividends may be subject to the same accrual, forfeiture, and payout restrictions as apply to dividends earned with respect to Shares of Restricted Stock, as set forth in Section 7.6 herein).
     8.5 . Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement, Performance Shares/Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement, a Participant's rights under the Plan shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant or the Participant's legal representative.
Nontransferability
     Until the Committee proposes for shareholder vote and shareholders approve a change in the general Performance Measures set forth in this Article 9, the attainment of which may determine the degree of payout and/or vesting with respect to Named Executive Officers' Awards that are intended to qualify under the performance-based compensation provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Performance Measure(s) to be used for purposes of such Awards shall be chosen from among the following (which may relate to the Company or a business unit, division or subsidiary): earnings, earnings per share, consolidated pre-tax earnings, net earnings, estimated earnings, operating income, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), gross margin, revenues, revenue growth, market value added, economic value added, return on equity, return on investment, return on assets, return on net assets, return on capital employed, total shareholder return, profit, economic profit, capitalized economic profit, after-tax profit, pre-tax profit, net income, cash flow measures, cash flow return, sales, sales volume, revenues per employee, stock price, cost, or goals related to acquisitions or divestitures. The Committee can establish other Performance Measures for performance Awards granted to Eligible Participants that are not Named Executive Officers and for performance Awards granted to Named Executive Officers that are not intended to qualify under the performance-based compensation exception of Section 162(m) of the Code.
     The Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in performance-based criteria or in the terms and conditions of other Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its financial statements or changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles. The Committee shall also have the discretion to adjust the determinations of the degree of attainment of the pre-established Performance Measures; provided, however, that Awards which are designed to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception from the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, and which are held by Named Executive Officers, may not be adjusted upward (except as a result of adjustments permitted by this paragraph), but the Committee shall retain the discretion to adjust such Awards downward.
     If applicable tax and/or securities laws change to permit Committee discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without obtaining shareholder approval of such changes, the Committee shall have sole discretion to make such changes without obtaining shareholder approval. In addition, in the event that the Committee determines that it is advisable to grant Awards which shall not qualify for the performance-based compensation exception from the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may make such grants without satisfying the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
     Each Participant may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's spouse, and if the Participant has no surviving spouse, to the Participant's estate. If required, the spouse of a married Participant domiciled in a community property jurisdiction shall join in any designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries other than the spouse.
     The Committee may permit a Participant to defer such Participant's receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the exercise of an Option or SAR, the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock, or RSUs, or the satisfaction of any requirements or goals with respect to Performance Shares. If any such deferral election is permitted, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals, which rules and procedures shall comply with Section 409A of the Code. . Notwithstanding the foregoing, no stock option or SAR that was not both earned and vested as of December 31, 2004 or that is materially modified after October 3, 2004, determined in each case within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, shall contain a feature for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(b)(5)(i)(A)(3) or  1.409A-1(b)(5)(i)(B)(3), respectively.
     12.1 . The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of any Award under this Plan. If a Participant makes a disposition within the meaning of Section 424(c) of the Code and regulation promulgated thereunder, of any Share or Shares issued to him pursuant to his exercise of an Incentive Stock Option within the two-year period commencing on the day after the date of the grant or within the one-year period commencing on the day after the date of transfer of such Share or Shares to the Optionee pursuant to such exercise, the Optionee shall, within ten (10) days of such disposition, notify the Company thereof, by delivery of written notice to the Company at its principal executive office.
Tax Withholding
 
     12.2 . With respect to withholding required upon the exercise of Options or SARS, upon the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock or RSUs, or upon any other taxable event arising as a result of Awards granted hereunder which are to be paid in the form of Shares, Participants may elect, unless not permitted by the Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a fair market value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to not more than the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld with respect to the transaction. All such elections shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
Share Withholding
     13.1 . The Committee or the Board may at any time terminate or from time to time amend the Plan in whole or in part, but no such action shall materially adversely affect any rights or obligations with respect to any Awards previously granted under the Plan, unless the affected Participants consent in writing. To the extent required by Section 162(m) or Section 422 of the Code, other applicable law, and/or any Listing Standards, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the shareholders of the Company.
Amendment of Plan
     13.2 . The Committee may, at any time, amend outstanding Agreements in a manner not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan; provided, however, except as provided in Sections 13.4 and 13.5, if such amendment is materially adverse to the Participant, as determined by the Committee, the amendment shall not be effective unless and until the Participant consents to such amendment. To the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, the Committee may, at any time, amend an outstanding Agreement in a manner that is not unfavorable to the Participant without the consent of such Participant.
Amendment of Award Agreement
     13.3 . No Awards shall be granted under the Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date of the Plan.
Termination of Plan
     13.4 . All Awards shall be subject to the Committee's right to cancel such Awards and/or to impose forfeitures to the extent required under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Committee may also provide in the Award Agreement that if a Participant engages in any "Detrimental Activity" (as defined below or in the Award Agreement), the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan to the contrary, cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise restrict or limit any unexpired, unexercised, unpaid or deferred Award as of the first date the Participant engages in the Detrimental Activity, unless sooner terminated by operation of another term of this Plan or any other agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agreement may also provide that if the Participant exercises an Option or SAR, receives a Performance Share, Performance Unit, or RSU payout, or receives Shares under an Award at any time during the period beginning six months prior to the date the Participant first engages in Detrimental Activity and ending six months after the date the Participant ceases to engage in any Detrimental Activity, the Participant shall be required to pay to the Company the excess of the then fair market value of the Shares subject to the Award over the total price paid by the Participant for such Shares.
Cancellation of Awards for Detrimental Activity
          For purposes of this Section, "Detrimental Activity" means any of the following, as determined by the Committee in good faith: (i) the violation of any agreement between the Company and the Participant relating to the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers, licensees, licensors or contractors, or
 
the performance of competitive services; (ii) conduct that constitutes Cause (as defined in Section 2.5 above), whether or not the Participant's employment is terminated for Cause; (iii) making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement, either written or oral, or conveying any information about the Company which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company; (iv) improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing any confidential information regarding the Company; or (v) the refusal or failure of a Participant to provide, upon the request of the Company, a certification, in a form satisfactory to the Company, that he or she is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan; provided, that the Committee may provide in the Agreement that only certain of the restrictions provided above apply for purposes of the Award Agreement.
     13.5 . In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the Company, the merger of the Company with or into another corporation such that shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the merger exchange their shares of stock in the Company for cash and/or shares of another entity or any other Change in Control or corporate transaction to which the Committee deems this provision applicable (any such event is referred to as a "Corporate Transaction"), the Committee may, in its discretion, cause each Award to be assumed or for an equivalent Award to be substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation (with such assumed or substituted Award adjusted as appropriate).
Assumption or Cancellation of Awards Upon a Corporate Transaction
     In addition or in the alternative, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that all or certain types of Awards will be cancelled at or immediately prior to the time of the Corporate Transaction; provided, however, that at least 15 days prior to the Corporate Transaction (or, if not feasible to provide 15 days notice, within a reasonable period prior to the Corporate Transaction), the Committee notifies the Participant that, subject to rescission if the Corporate Transaction is not successfully completed within a certain period, the Award will be terminated and provides the Participant, either, at the election of the Committee, (i) a payment (in cash or Shares) equal to value of the Award, as determined below, or (ii) the right to exercise the Option or other Award as to all Shares, including Shares as to which the Option or other Award would not otherwise be exercisable (or with respect to Restricted Stock, RSUs, Performance Shares or Performance Units, provide that all restrictions shall lapse) prior to the Corporate Transaction. For purposes of this provision, the value of the Award shall be the value determined in good faith by the Committee and shall generally be measured as of the date of the Corporate Transaction and shall generally equal the amount of cash or Shares that would be payable to the Participant upon exercise or vesting of the Award, less the amount of any payment required to be tendered by the Participant upon such exercise; provided, however, the Committee may also determine that the amount payable to the Participant upon cancellation of an Award shall equal the consideration the Participant would have received under the terms of the Corporate Transaction if the Award was fully vested, paid, or exercised (as applicable) immediately prior to the closing of the Corporate Transaction and, thus, the Participant was treated as a Shareholder with respect to the Shares that would have been paid upon such vesting, payment, or exercise. For example, the amount payable to the Participant upon the Committee's decision to cancel outstanding Options would usually equal the difference between the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Options and the Exercise Price for such Options, computed as of the date of the Corporate Transaction.
 
     Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, except as provided otherwise in the Award Agreement or unless otherwise specifically prohibited by the terms of Article 15, but subject to Article 13:
     (a) Any and all Options and SARs granted to Participants under the Plan shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable;
     (b) All restrictions on Awards of Restricted Stock and RSUs shall lapse and Shares shall be delivered to the Participant in accordance with Article 7 and the terms of the Award Agreement; and
     (c) Subject to Article 13 hereof, the Committee shall have the authority to make any modifications to the Awards as determined by the Committee to be appropriate before the effective date of the Change in Control.
     15.1 . All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any Listing Standards and any applicable federal or state laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. In making such determination, the Committee may rely upon an opinion of counsel for the Company.
Restrictions on Shares
          Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any Shares under the Plan or make any other distribution of the benefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable state and federal laws (including, without limitation and if applicable, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933), and any applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
     15.2 . Except as otherwise provided in Article 7 of the Plan and in the Restricted Stock Agreement, each Participant who receives an Award of Restricted Stock shall have all of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote the Shares to the extent, if any, such Shares possess voting rights and receive dividends and other distributions. Except as provided otherwise in the Plan or in an Agreement, no Participant awarded an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, RSU, Performance Unit, or Performance Share shall have any right as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by such Award prior to the date of issuance to him or his delegate of a certificate or certificates for such Shares or the date the Participant's name is registered on the Company's book as the shareholder of record with respect to such Shares.
Rights of a Shareholder
     15.3 . Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the service of the Employer, or to serve as a Director thereof, or interfere in any way with the right of the Employer to terminate his or
No Implied Rights
 
her employment or other service relationship at any time. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan, severance program, or other arrangement of the Employer for the benefit of its employees. No Participant shall have any claim to an Award until it is actually granted under the Plan. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall, except as otherwise provided by the Committee, be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
     15.4
Compliance with Laws.
     (a) At all times when the Committee determines that compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code is required or desirable, all Awards to Named Executive Officers shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. In addition, in the event that changes are made to Section 162(m) of the Code to permit greater flexibility with respect to any Awards, the Committee may, subject to the requirements of Article 13, make any adjustments it deems appropriate.
     (b) The Plan and the grant of Awards shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations and to such approvals by any United States government or regulatory agency as may be required. Any provision herein relating to compliance with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act shall not be applicable with respect to participation in the Plan by Participants who are not Insiders.
     15.5 . The terms of the Plan shall be binding upon the Company, and its successors and assigns.
Successors
     15.6 . Each Participant agrees to give the Committee prompt written notice of any election made by such Participant under Code Section 83(b) or any similar provision thereof.
Tax Elections
     15.7 . The Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A and any regulations or guidance that may be adopted thereunder from time to time. The Plan may be amended or interpreted by the Committee as it determines necessary or appropriate in accordance with Code Section 409A and to avoid a plan failure under Code Section 409A(a)(1). If any Award is subject to and not exempt from, Code Section 409A, and if amounts under the Award are payable upon a Participant's "separation from service" (as defined in Code Section 409A) when the Participant is a "specified employee" (as defined in Code Section 409A), the payment shall be delayed until the first business day that is at least six months after the Participant's "separation from service."
Compliance With Code Section 409A
     15.8 .
Legal Construction
     (a) . If any provision of this Plan or an Agreement is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or would disqualify the Plan or any Agreement under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Agreement, it shall be stricken and the remainder of the Plan or the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability
     (b) . Where the context admits, words in any gender shall include the other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and words in the plural shall include the singular.
Gender and Number

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
      Aaron Rents, Inc. (NYSE: RNT and RNT.A), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories, announced that the Company will change its name to Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., Aaron's President and Chief Executive Officer, officially unveiled the new name Monday evening to 2,000 associates in attendance at Aaron's National Managers Meeting held in Washington, D.C.
(ATLANTA) April 14, 2009
Aaron's, Inc.
     "Aaron's is creating consistent brand messaging by bringing the corporate name in line with the trade name of our over 1,575 stores. Our customers and their friends know and trust the Aaron's name in our advertising and through our community outreach," said Mr. Loudermilk, Jr. "Further, the name change reflects our unique sales and lease ownership business model which was started in 1987."
     The Company also announced Monday night that it will change its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol for its Common Stock from "RNT" to "AAN" and its ticker symbol for its Class A Common Stock from "RNT.A" to "AAN.A." The name change and ticker symbol change will be effective on April 20, 2009.
     Aaron Rents, Inc. was founded in 1955 by R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., who remains Chairman today. The Company has a strong heritage of customer responsiveness by providing quality products through a non-credit based payment plan. Mr. Loudermilk, Sr. started the Company after serving in the U.S. Navy and graduating from the University of North Carolina. One summer, he and a business partner received their first rental order for 300 folding chairs. To fulfill the order, Loudermilk purchased used Army-surplus chairs and rented them for 10 cents a chair per day. After the chairs were returned, he stocked them in a warehouse in the hopes that another order would be placed soon for folding chairs. "We didn't believe in conducting credit checks then and we don't conduct credit checks now," said Mr. Loudermilk, Sr., "But we do ask for the phone numbers of our customers' mothers."
     "Our sales and lease ownership business is distinct from the conventional rent-to-own industry, and our name change reflects that uniqueness," said Ken Butler, Chief Operating Officer of Aaron's. "We're proud of the Company's heritage that began as a traditional rental company evolving to meet the needs of our customers by bringing them affordable home furnishings necessities of life."
 
Page 2/ AARON RENTS, INC. CHANGES NAME TO AARON'S, INC.
     Last November, Aaron's sold substantially all of the assets of its Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division, which comprised its residential rent-to-rent business. The Aaron's Corporate Furnishings division most recently had represented approximately six percent of the Company's consolidated revenues, and its growth rates and long term potential had not matched the fast-growing Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division.
About Aaron's, Inc.

(NYSE: AAN and AAN.A effective April 20, 2009), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances and accessories has more than 1,575 Company-operated and franchised stores in 48 states and Canada.

Date:  April 28, 2009

 
ATLANTA, April 27, 2009  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2009.
For the first quarter of 2009, revenues rose 15% to $474.0 million compared to $412.7 million for the same quarter a year ago.  Net earnings from continuing operations were $35.4 million versus $22.6 million in 2008, a 57% increase.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $.65 compared to $.42 per share for last years quarter, a 55% increase.
We are pleased with these record revenues and earnings and that once again our results exceeded expectations, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  
Our business has been especially strong in recent quarters as more consumers are finding
it extremely attractive to use the
Aarons option of obtaining basic home furnishings necessities with no credit checks and the ability to return the
merchandise at any time
. Although we have done well through the years in different economic environments, both good and challenging, we believe the current conditions have helped accelerate the number of customers coming into our stores.  
We currently see no indication that this trend will diminish in the foreseeable future
.
 
 
 
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 12.3% during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008.  Same store revenues also increased 7.9% for Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership stores open over two years at the end of March 2009. The Company had 760,000 customers and its franchisees had 395,000 customers at the end of the first quarter of 2009, a 20% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the first quarter a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc.).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 17% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
As previously announced, on November 6, 2008 the Company consummated the sale of substantially all of the assets of its Aarons Corporate Furnishings division.  The Company no longer includes the revenues and expenses of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division in its continuing operations, and now reports the net earnings or loss of the division as discontinued operations.  Prior periods are restated to reflect this change in accounting treatment.
Division Results
The Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the first quarter of 2009 to $469.3 million, a 15% increase over the $406.3 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2008.
A net loss of $209,000 from discontinued operations was recorded for the first quarter of 2009, compared to net earnings of $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees increased 15% and franchise royalties and fees went up 19% during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.  Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 9% for the quarter versus the first quarter of last year.  The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $193.6 million during the first quarter of 2009, a 16% increase over the 2008 quarter.  Same store revenues for franchised stores were up 15% for the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year.  Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aarons, Inc.  The Companys other revenues in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008 included a $5.7 million and $2.3 million gain, respectively, from the sale of Company-operated stores.
 
 
 
Store Count
During the first quarter of 2009 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened nine new Company-operated stores, acquired seven franchised stores and one franchised RIMCO store, acquired the accounts of five third party stores, closed nine stores, and sold 23 Company-operated stores to five separate franchise entities.  The Company also opened ten new franchised stores.  The franchised store count increased by 37 stores during the quarter due mainly to the previously announced conversion of the stores of Kelly Rentals, Inc. to Aarons franchised stores as well as the above-mentioned sale of 23 Company-operated stores to franchisees.
During the first quarter the Company awarded area development agreements to open 71 additional franchised stores. At the end of March 2009 there were 300 franchised stores awarded that are expected to be opened over the next several years.
At March 31, 2009 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,011 Company-operated stores, 532 franchised stores, 11 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and seven franchised RIMCO stores.  The Company also had 16 Aarons Office Furniture stores.  The total number of stores open at the end of March 31, 2009 was 1,577.
Second Quarter and Full Year 2009 Outlook
The Company is updating its guidance for 2009 and expects to achieve the following:
 
 
 
 
Conference Call
Aarons will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Tuesday, April 28, 2009, at 10:30 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen in to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Companys website, , in the Investor Relations section.

The entire production of MacTavish is for shipment to Aarons stores.

Pursuant to this facility, the Company's franchisees can borrow funds guaranteed by the Company. The Franchisee Loan Facility Amendment amends the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility to, among other things, (a) extend the maturity date of the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility until May 22, 2010, (b) increase the maximum commitment amount under the facility from $125,000,000 to $175,000,000, (c) increase the maximum available amount of swing loans from $8,000,000 to $20,000,000, (d) increase the Companys commitment fees and interest obligations thereunder, and (e) modify certain exhibits to the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility, including the form of Franchisee Borrower Loan and Security Agreement.
The Company remains subject to the same financial covenants under the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility, which forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and require the maintenance of a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under the agreement.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On June 8, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Aarons, Inc. (the Company) approved the establishment of a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (the Plan) that will be effective July 1, 2009. Under the Plan, non-employee directors of the Company and, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, a select group of management or highly compensated employees, will be entitled to elect to defer certain portions of their compensation on a pre-tax basis. Eligible non-employee directors will be able to defer up to 100% of both their cash and stock director fees, and eligible employees will be able to defer up to 75% of their base pay and up to 100% of their bonus compensation. In addition, the Company may make restoration matching contributions on behalf of eligible employees to make up for certain limitations on the amount of matching contributions an employee can receive under the Companys tax-qualified 401(k) plan.
The contribution amounts will be recorded to book entry deferred compensation accounts, the value of which will be determined based upon the performance of designated investment funds (the Measurement Funds) selected by the participants in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The contributions will not be invested in the Measurement Funds, but will be treated as if invested in such Measurement Funds in order to determine the value of each participants deferred compensation account under the Plan.
Deferred amounts may be distributed, as more specifically described in the Plan, during employment and following a participants separation from service, disability or death in a lump sum or in annual installments, as elected by the participant. Distributions generally will be made in cash. However, distributions representing stock fees deferred by non-employee directors will be paid in non-voting shares of the Companys common stock.
The Plan does not require that the Company establish any trust, escrow arrangement or other mechanism for the purpose of segregating funds for the payment of the Plan obligations. However, the Company has established a grantor trust, known as a rabbi trust, to allow it to accumulate assets to help fund payment of the Plan obligations. While participants have a beneficial interest in the trusts assets, to the extent provided under the terms and conditions of the trust agreement and the Plan only, no participant in the Plan has any preferred claim to any assets of the trust. The assets of the trust are subject to the reach of the Companys creditors in the event of the Companys insolvency.
The obligations of the Company under the Plan are unsecured general obligations to pay in the future the balance of the book entry deferred compensation accounts. A participants interest in, and right to receive payment of, the participants account under the Plan is an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company and will rank equally with other unsecured indebtedness incurred from time to time by the Company.
The foregoing description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 21, 2009, Aarons, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the second quarter of 2009.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
ATLANTA, July 21, 2009  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009.
 
For the second quarter of 2009, revenues increased 8% to $417.3 million compared to $387.0 million for the same quarter a year ago.  Net earnings from continuing operations were up 24% to $27.8 million versus $22.4 million in 2008.  Diluted earnings per share were $.51 compared to $.43 per share a year ago, a 19% increase.
 
For the first six months of this year, revenues advanced 11% to $891.3 million compared to $799.7 million for the first six months of 2008.  Net earnings from continuing operations were $63.2 million versus $44.9 million last year, a 41% increase.  Diluted earnings per share for the first six months were $1.15 for 2009 versus $.89 in 2008, a 29% increase.
 
 We are highly pleased with these results, said Robert C.
Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  Our same store revenue and customer growth remain strong and we are on track with our 2009 new store opening plans.  In this difficult economic environment consumers still need home furnishing necessities, and especially need the ability to obtain the merchandise with no credit checks or long-term obligations.   We believe that the Aarons offering is extremely valuable to this credit-constrained consumer.
 
 
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 8.4% during the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008.  Same store revenues also increased 5.2% for Company-operated stores open over two years at the end of June 2009. The Company had 787,000 customers and its franchisees had 406,000 customers at the end of the second quarter of 2009, an 18% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the second quarter a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc.).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 15.7% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
 
Although overall revenue in the quarter was less than projected, it was primarily due to lower than anticipated non-retail sales to our franchisees, a decline in the amount of the early payouts of lease agreements compared to the same period a year ago, and lower revenues in our office furniture stores, continued Mr. Loudermilk, Jr.
 
The total dollar amount of the lower margin non-retail sales were up only 3% for the quarter even though the actual number of units shipped from our fulfillment centers increased over 20%.  This difference is mainly due to declining costs of electronic products,
 Mr. Loudermilk, Jr. added.  We also believe that last year the government stimulus checks had a positive effect on early payouts and overall business.
 
At the end of June the Company had cash on hand of $83.3 million versus $5.9 million at the end of the first quarter 2009.  This increase in cash is due to cash flow generated from operations and the sale leaseback of approximately $30 million of store real estate during the quarter.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company consummated the sale of substantially all of the assets of its Aarons Corporate Furnishings division.  The Company no longer includes the revenues and expenses of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division in its continuing operations, and now reports the net earnings or loss of the division as discontinued operations.  Prior periods are restated to reflect this change in accounting treatment.
Division Results
 
The Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the second quarter of 2009 to $416.6 million, an 8% increase over the $386.6 million in revenues in the second quarter of 2008.  First six months sales and lease ownership revenues increased 11% to $890.2 million compared to $799.0 million for the same period a year ago.
 
 
 
 
 
Included in the divisions results are the revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture stores which had revenues of $3.5 million in the second quarter and $8.8 million for the first six months of 2009 compared to $5.2 million and $11.3 million, respectively, for the comparable periods of 2008.
 
A net loss of $76,000 from discontinued operations was recorded for the second quarter of 2009 compared to net earnings of $918,000 in the second quarter of 2008.  For the six months the net loss was $285,000 compared to net earnings of $3.1 million for the same period in 2008.
Components of Revenue
 
Consolidated lease revenues and fees for the second quarter and first half of 2009 increased 10% and 12% over the comparable previous year periods, respectively.  In addition, franchise royalties and fees were up 19% for both the second quarter and year to date compared to the same period in 2008.  Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased to $67.8 million for the second quarter from $66.1 million in the comparable period in 2008 and to $160.8 million for the first six months compared to $151.5 million for the first six months of last year.  The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $183.8 million during the second quarter and $377.4 million for the first six months of 2009, both 15% increases over the prior year periods.  Same store revenues for franchised stores were up 9.9% for the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year.  Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aarons, Inc.
The Companys other revenues in the second quarter of 2009 and 2008 included $417,000 and $3.4 million of gains, respectively, from the sale of the assets of Company-operated stores.  Other revenues for the first six months included gains from the sale of stores of $6.1 million in 2009 and $5.8 million in 2008.
Store Count
 
During the second quarter of 2009 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 19 new Company-operated stores, 19 new franchised stores, and one RIMCO store.  It also acquired seven franchised stores and one third party store during the quarter.  In addition, in the second quarter the Company sold one Company-operated store to a franchisee and closed two Company-operated stores, and two franchised stores were also closed.
 
 
 
 
Through the three months and six months ended June 30 of this year, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 13 and 84 additional franchised stores, respectively.  At the end of June 2009 there were 280 franchised stores awarded that are expected to be opened over the next several years.
 
At the end of the second quarter of 2009 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,035 Company-operated stores, 543 franchised stores, 12 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and seven franchised RIMCO stores.  The Company also had 16 Aarons Office Furniture stores.  The total number of stores open at the end of June 30, 2009 was 1,613.
Third Quarter and Full Year 2009 Outlook
 
The Company is updating its guidance for 2009 and expects to achieve the following:

ATLANTA, October 21, 2009  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009.
 For the third quarter of 2009, revenues increased 7% to $415.3 million compared to $388.0 million for the same period last year.  Net earnings from continuing operations rose 24% to $24.7 million versus $19.8 million recorded in the third quarter a year ago.   Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $.45 compared to $.37 for the third quarter of last year, a 22% increase.  Diluted earnings per share were $.45 compared to $.39 per share in 2008.
For the first nine months of this year, revenues were up 10% to $1.307 billion compared to $1.188 billion for the same period of 2008.  Net earnings from continuing operations for the nine months increased 36% to $87.8 million versus $64.8 million for the corresponding period a year ago.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.61 compared to $1.20 last year, up 34%.  Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months increased to $1.60 for 2009 versus $1.28 for 2008.
In the third quarter the Company recorded a $2.2 million pre-tax charge to operating expenses relating to the write-down of certain lease merchandise and the impairment of long-lived assets associated with its Aarons Office Furniture stores.  Additionally, in the third quarter the Companys tax provision was favorably impacted by a $2.3 million reversal of previously recorded liabilities for uncertain income tax positions.
 The third quarter results from our Aarons Company-operated and franchised stores were very good, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  We continue to have strong revenue and customer growth in a time when other retailers are struggling.  We believe this is due to Aarons superior business model and execution in serving our large customer base.
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 6.3% during the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008.  Same store revenues also increased 4.5% for Company-operated stores open over two years at the end of September 2009. The Company had 789,000 customers and its franchisees had 416,000 customers at the end of the third quarter of 2009, a 16% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the third quarter a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc.).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 12.3% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
 The revenue and customer growth in our stores met our expectations and were excellent compared to the third quarter of last year when many customers benefited from government stimulus checks, continued Mr. Loudermilk, Jr.  Our core lease revenue was up 10% for the quarter compared to a year ago.  The growth of overall revenue was again impacted by non-retail sales to franchisees, which decreased in dollars by 2% in the quarter compared to a year ago, although units shipped were up 8%.
The Aarons Office Furniture stores have not been profitable for many quarters and this economically sensitive business has further declined recently, Mr. Loudermilk, Jr. added.  During the quarter we wrote-down a portion of the stores assets, primarily lease merchandise and fixed assets, as our ability to recover the recorded values of these assets could not be substantiated.  We will continue to evaluate the office furniture stores and are working on plans to improve their future financial performance.
In the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company consummated the sale of substantially all of the assets of its Aarons Corporate Furnishings division.  The Company no longer includes the revenues and expenses of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division in its continuing operations, and now reports the net earnings or loss of the division as discontinued operations.  Prior periods are restated to reflect this change in accounting treatment.
Division Results
Revenues in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division in the third quarter increased 7% to $414.4 million compared to $387.9 million last year.  Sales and lease ownership revenues for the first nine months rose 10% to $1.305 billion compared to $1.187 billion a year ago.
Included in the divisions results are the revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture stores which decreased 34% to $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $5.3 million in the comparable period in 2008.  Aarons Office Furniture revenues for the first nine months declined 26% to $12.3 million compared to $16.6 million a year ago.  The Aarons Office Furniture stores recorded pre-tax losses of $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2009, including the above mentioned asset write-downs, and $357,000 in the third quarter of 2008, and pre-tax losses of $6.5 million for the first nine months of 2009 and $1.5 million in the comparable period in 2008.
A net loss of $19,000 from discontinued operations was recorded for the third quarter of 2009 compared to net earnings of $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2008.  For the first nine months of 2009 the net loss was $304,000 compared to net earnings of $4.3 million for the same period a year ago.
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees increased 10% for the third quarter and 12% for the first nine months compared to the same periods in the previous year.  In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 16% for the third quarter and 18% year-to-date compared to the same periods last year.   Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, decreased 2% to $69.5 million for the third quarter from $70.7 million in the comparable period in 2008, and increased 4% to $230.3 million for the first nine months compared to $222.2 million for the same period last year. The increases during the year in the Companys franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of the increases in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $185.1 million for the third quarter and $562.5 million for the first nine months of 2009, a 12% and 14% increase over the comparable prior year periods, respectively.  Same store revenues for franchised stores were up 7.8% for the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008.  Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aarons, Inc.
 The Companys other revenues in the third quarter of 2009 and 2008 included $193,000 and $2.6 million of gains, respectively, from the sales of the assets of Company-operated stores.  Other revenues for the first nine months included gains from the sales of stores of $6.3 million in 2009 and $8.4 million in 2008.
Store Count
During the third quarter the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 20 new Company-operated stores, 12 new franchised stores, and one Company-operated RIMCO store.  Ten franchised stores were also added through an independent operator converting its existing stores to the Aarons concept.  The Company sold three Company-operated sales and lease ownership stores to franchisees, one store to a third party, and closed four stores. Three franchised stores were also closed.  In addition, during the quarter the Company acquired three franchised stores, nine third party stores, purchased the accounts of seven third party stores, and sold accounts from one store to an independent operator.  The Aarons Office Furniture division opened one and closed three stores during the quarter.
Through the three months and nine months ended September 30 of this year, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 47 and 131 additional franchised stores, respectively.   At the end of September there were a total of 285 franchised stores awarded that we expect will open over the next several years.
At the end of the third quarter of 2009 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,059 Company-operated stores, 562 franchised stores, 13 Company-operated RIMCO stores and seven franchised RIMCO stores.  In addition, the Company operated 14 Aarons Office Furniture stores.  The total number of stores open at the end of September 2009 was 1,655.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 and 2010 Outlook
The Company is updating its guidance for the remainder of 2009 as well as providing diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010.  The following is expected to be achieved at this time:
-  
Fourth quarter revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of approximately $430 million.
-  
Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share in the range of $.41 to $.46 per share, assuming no significant store or other asset sales.
-  
Fiscal year revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of approximately $1.74 billion.
-  
Fiscal year 2009 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.01 to $2.06.
 
 
-  
Our initial earnings guidance for 2010 is to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.15 to $2.35.
 
 
 
-  
For 2009 new store growth of approximately 7% to 8% over the store base at the end of 2008, for the most part an equal mix between Company-operated and franchised stores.  We expect similar new store growth in 2010 in the range of 5% to 9% over the ending 2009 store count.  This is expected to be a net store growth after any opportunistic merging or disposition of stores.
-  
The Company will continue as warranted to consolidate or sell stores not meeting performance goals.
-  
The Company also plans to continue to acquire franchised stores, convert independent operators stores to Aarons franchised stores, and sell Company-operated stores to franchisees as opportunities present themselves.

On December 18, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Aaron's, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment to certain restricted stock awards made on November 7, 2006. The original terms of the affected awards, which were made under the Company's 2001 Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan, provided that (1) half of the shares granted to a recipient would vest on February 28, 2010 (the "Vesting Date") upon the achievement of a specified average annual pre-tax profit margin for the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division over the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and (2) the other half would vest on the Vesting Date upon the achievement of a 15% average annual revenue growth rate for the division over the same three-year period, in each case provided the recipient remained employed with the Company through the Vesting Date. Although it appears that the pre-tax profit margin objective will be exceeded, it is expected that the average annual revenue growth rate will be in the range of 12% to 13%.
As initially announced in the Company's October 24, 2007 press release regarding its third quarter 2007 results, starting in late 2007 (less than one year into the three-year measurement period for the restricted stock awards) the Company changed its strategy to more effectively manage existing and new stores and improve overall operating and profit performance. This change was partially accomplished by slowing the Company's pace of new store openings, in addition to accelerating the consolidation and/or disposition of underperforming stores. The Compensation Committee noted that the decision to slow store growth, while succeeding in helping to improve profitability, inevitably slowed revenue growth as well. The Committee also observed that the actual revenue growth rate achieved was commendable, not only in view of the strategic decision to slow store growth, but also considering the negative economic conditions that have prevailed in recent years.
In light of these considerations, the Committee amended the revenue growth vesting condition to reduce the target growth rate, but also to extend the measurement period by an additional year. Specifically, as amended, the 50% portion of the awards contingent upon achieving specified revenue growth will vest on February 28, 2011 if the average annual revenue growth rate for the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division over the four-year period ended December 31, 2010 exceeds 10%.
The amendment modifies only the portion of the November 2006 restricted stock grants that relates to the revenue growth objective, and in no way modifies the portion of the grants that relates to the pre-tax profit margin objective. The portion of the grants that depend upon achievement of the pre-tax profit margin objective will continue unmodified, and will vest or be forfeited on February 28, 2010 in accordance with the original terms of the awards.
The Company's form of Performance-Based Vesting Restricted Stock Award Agreement used under its 2001 Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.
 
Statements in this Form 8-K regarding the Company's business that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues, and the risks and uncertainties discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. Statements in this release that are "forward-looking" include, without limitation, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division's projected pre-tax profit margin and revenue growth rate for the three-year period ending December 31, 2009.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 10.1

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED, by and between the Company and the Grantee, as follows:

The Company hereby grants to the Grantee an award of Shares of restricted stock ("Restricted Stock"), subject to, and in accordance with, the restrictions, terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. The grant date of this award of Restricted Stock is , 20("Grant Date").
     
     
     
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the Plan (which are incorporated herein by reference) and, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, the capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the same definitions as set forth in the Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with any Subsidiary of the Company shall be considered employment with the Company. Further, with respect to a Grantee who is a non-employee Director, any reference in this Agreement to employment with the Company shall mean the Director's service on the Board and any reference to termination of employment with the Company shall mean the Director's cessation of service on the Board.
This Award is conditioned on the Grantee's execution of this Agreement. If this Agreement is not executed by the Grantee and returned to the Company within one month of the Grant Date, it may be canceled by the Committee resulting in the immediate forfeiture of all Shares of Restricted Stock.
 
2.
Restrictions
Subject to Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 below, if the Grantee remains employed by the Company and the performance goals reflected on Exhibit A ("Performance Goals") are met, the Grantee shall become fully vested in the Restricted Stock on , 20(such date shall be the "Vesting Date"). On the Vesting Date (provided the Performance Goals have been met) Grantee shall own the Shares of Restricted Stock free and clear of all restrictions imposed by this Agreement (except those imposed by Section 3.4 below), and the Company shall deliver a certificate(s) for the Shares of Restricted Stock to Grantee as soon as practical after the Vesting Date. Except as provided in Section 2.2 or 2.3 below, if the Performance Goals have not been met or are only partially met as of the Vesting Date, the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which the Performance Goals were not met shall be immediately forfeited as of the Vesting Date.
     
     
In the event prior to the Vesting Date Grantee dies while actively employed by the Company, the Restricted Stock shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of the Grantee's death. The Company shall deliver certificate(s) for the Restricted Stock, free and clear of any restrictions imposed by this Agreement (except for Section 3.4) to Grantee's personal representative or his estate as soon as practical after his date of death. Except for death, or as provided in Section 2.3, if Grantee terminates employment prior to the Vesting Date (for any other reason including Retirement), the Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and all rights of Grantee to such Shares shall be terminated.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control prior to Grantee's Vesting Date, the Restricted Stock shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of the Change in Control. On the date of the Change in Control, the Company shall deliver to Grantee a certificate(s) for the Restricted Stock, free and clear of any restrictions imposed by this Agreement.
The Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered prior to the date Grantee becomes vested in the Restricted Stock.
3. Stock; Dividends; Voting
3.1 The stock certificate(s) evidencing the Restricted Stock shall be registered on the Company's books in the name of the Grantee as of the Grant Date. Physical possession or custody of such stock certificates shall be retained by the Company until such time as the Shares of Restricted Stock are vested in accordance with Section 2. While in its possession, the Company reserves the right to place a legend on the stock certificate(s) restricting the transferability of such certificates and referring to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture) of this Agreement and the Plan.
 
3.2 During the period the Restricted Stock is not vested, the Grantee generally shall not be entitled to vote such Restricted Stock. All dividends declared and paid by the Company on Shares of Restricted Stock shall be deferred until the restrictions on the Restricted Stock lapse in accordance with Section 2. These deferred dividends shall be held by the Company for the Grantee's account. Upon the forfeiture of the Restricted Stock, any deferred dividends attributable to such Restricted Stock shall also be forfeited.
3.3 In the event of any adjustments in authorized Shares as provided in Section 4.3 of the Plan, the number and class of Shares of Restricted Stock or other securities that Grantee shall be entitled to pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted or changed to reflect such change, provided that any such additional Shares of Restricted Stock or additional or different shares or securities shall remain subject to the restrictions in this Agreement.
3.4 The Grantee represents and warrants that he is acquiring the Restricted Stock for investment purposes only, and not with a view to distribution thereof. The Grantee is aware that the Restricted Stock may not be registered under the federal or any state securities laws and that, in addition to the other restrictions on the Restricted Stock, the shares will not be able to be transferred unless an exemption from registration is available. By making this award of Restricted Stock, the Company is not undertaking any obligation to register the Restricted Stock under any federal or state securities laws.
4. No Right to Continued Employment
Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall be interpreted or construed to confer upon the Grantee any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Company or a Subsidiary, nor shall this Agreement or the Plan interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the Grantee's employment at any time, subject to Grantee's rights under this Agreement.
5. Taxes and Withholding
The Grantee shall be responsible for all federal, state and local income taxes payable with respect to this award of Restricted Stock. The Grantee shall have the right to make such elections under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as are available in connection with this award of Restricted Stock, including a "Section 83(b) election." The Company and Grantee agree to report the value of the Restricted Stock in a consistent manner for federal income tax purposes. The Company shall have the right to retain and withhold from any payment of Restricted Stock the amount of taxes required by any government to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid with respect to such payment. The Company may require Grantee to reimburse the Company for any such taxes required to be withheld and may withhold any distribution in whole or in part until the Company is so reimbursed. The Company shall also have the right to withhold from any other cash amounts due to Grantee an amount equal to such taxes required to be withheld. Unless the Grantee otherwise provides for the satisfaction of the withholding requirements in advance, the Company shall withhold and cancel a number of Shares of Restricted Stock having a market value equal to the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld.
 
6. Grantee Bound by the Plan
The Grantee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions thereof.
7. Restrictive Covenants
7.1 Grantee hereby acknowledges that the Company may disclose (and/or has already disclosed) to the Grantee and the Grantee may be provided with access to and otherwise make use of, certain valuable, Confidential Information (as defined below) of the Company. Grantee also acknowledges that due to the Grantee's relationship with the Company, Grantee will develop (and/or has developed) special contacts and relationships with the Company's employees and that it would be unfair and harmful to the Company if the Grantee took advantage of these relationships to the detriment of the Company.
7.2 Grantee hereby agrees that during employment and for a period of one (1) year following any voluntary or involuntary termination of employment with the Company (regardless of reason), the Grantee will not directly or indirectly, individually, or on behalf of any Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary:
(a) solicit, recruit or induce (or otherwise assist any person or entity in soliciting, recruiting or inducing) any employee or independent contractor of the Company who performed work for the Company within the final year of the Grantee's employment with the Company to terminate his or her relationship with the Company;
(b) knowingly or intentionally damage or destroy the goodwill and esteem of the Company, any Subsidiary, the Company's Business or the Company's or any Subsidiary's suppliers, employees, patrons, customers, and others who may at any time have or have had relations with the Company or any Subsidiary.
7.3 The Grantee further agrees that during employment and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, he or she will not, except as necessary to carry out his duties as an employee of the Company, disclose or use Confidential Information without the Company's prior written consent. The Grantee further agrees that, upon termination or expiration of employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever or at any time, the Grantee will deliver promptly to the Company all materials (including electronically-stored materials), documents, plans, records, notes, or other papers, and any copies in the Grantee's possession or control, relating in any way to the Company's Business or containing any Confidential Information of the Company, which at all times shall be the property of the Company.
7.4 For purposes of this Section 7, the following terms shall have the meanings specified below:
 
(a) "Company's Business" means the businesses of (i) the sales and lease ownership, specialty retailing, and rental of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, household appliances, and accessories, and (ii) the manufacture of specially designed residential and office furniture for use in the sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishing divisions.
(b) "Confidential Information" means information, without regard to form, relating to the Company's or any Subsidiary's customers, operation, finances, and business that derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to other Persons, including, but not limited to, financial statements, manuals, business plans, business rules, business methods, business practices, market studies, methods, graphs, strategies, techniques, processes, procedures, formulas, inventions, marketing and pricing data, pricing policies or lists, technical or non-technical data (including personnel data), contracts, sources and identity of vendors and contractors, financial information of customers and the Company, computer software and programs (including object code and source code), computer database systems, and other proprietary documents, materials, or information regarding (or otherwise obtained by) the Company, its businesses and activities, or the manner in which the Company does business. Confidential Information includes information disclosed to the Company or any Subsidiary by third parties that the Company or any Subsidiary is obligated to maintain as confidential. Confidential Information subject to this Agreement may include information that is not a trade secret under applicable law, but information not constituting a trade secret only shall be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement for a two (2) year period after the Grantee's date of termination of employment.

7.5 If, during his employment with the Company or at any time during the restrictive periods described in Section 7.2 or 7.3 above, the Grantee violates the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 7, then the Committee shall, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel any outstanding Shares of Restricted Stock that have not yet vested. The parties further agree and acknowledge that the rights conveyed by this Agreement are of a unique and special nature and that the Company will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of a failure by the Grantee to abide by its terms and conditions nor will money damages adequately compensate for such injury. It is, therefore, agreed between the parties that, in the event of a breach by the Grantee of any of his obligations contained in Section 7 of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right, among other rights, to damages sustained thereby and to obtain an injunction or decree of specific performance from any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or compel the Grantee to perform as agreed herein. The Grantee agrees that this Section 7 shall survive the termination of his or her employment. Nothing contained herein shall in any way limit or exclude any other right granted by law or equity to the Company.
 
8. Modification of Agreement
This Agreement may be modified or amended at any time by the Committee, provided that the Grantee's written consent must be obtained for any modification that adversely alters or impairs any rights or obligations under this Agreement, unless there is an express Plan provision permitting the Committee to act unilaterally to make the modification.
9. Severability
Should any provision of this Agreement be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected by such holding and shall continue in full force in accordance with their terms.
10. Governing Law
The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia without giving effect to the conflicts of the laws principles thereof.
11. Successors in Interest
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon any person acquiring, whether by merger, consolidation, reorganization, purchase of stock or assets, or otherwise, all or substantially all of the Company's assets and business. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Grantee's legal representatives. All obligations imposed upon the Grantee and all rights granted to the Company under this Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Grantee's heirs, executors, administrators and successors.
12. Resolution of Disputes
Any dispute or disagreement which may arise under, or as a result of, or in any way relate to the interpretation, construction or application of this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee. Any determination made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Grantee and the Company for all purposes.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.
Grantee hereby (i) acknowledges that a copy of the Plan is available from the Company's intranet site or upon request, (ii) represents that he is familiar with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, and (iii) accepts the award of Restricted Stock subject to all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Plan.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On February 16, 2010, Aarons, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
(a)           Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired:
None.
(b)           Pro Forma Financial Information:
None.
(d)           Exhibits:
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
ATLANTA, February 16, 2010  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009.
For the fourth quarter of 2009, revenues increased 10% to $446.3 million compared to $404.9 million for the fourth quarter in 2008.  Net earnings from continuing operations increased 19% to $25.0 million versus $21.0 million last year.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and diluted earnings after considering discontinued operations per share were $.46 compared to $.39 per share a year ago, an 18% increase.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenues increased 10% to $1.753 billion compared to $1.593 billion for 2008.  Net earnings from continuing operations increased 32% to $112.9 million versus $85.8 million a year ago.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 31% to $2.07 for 2009 compared to $1.58 in 2008.  Diluted earnings per share were $2.06 compared to $1.66 last year, a 24% increase.
This was another outstanding quarter for us, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  We continue to grow as well as deliver our shareholders excellent financial results, and our view of the future remains optimistic.  Our customer base needs basic home furnishings, and no matter what the economic environment we have proven that we are well positioned to fulfill these needs.
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 5.2% during the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.  Same store revenues also increased 4.6% for Company-operated stores open for over two years at the end of December 2009.  The Company had 829,000 customers and its franchisees had 451,000 customers at the end of the year, a 16% increase in total customers over the number at the end of 2008 (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 10.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
In the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company consummated the sale of substantially all of the assets of its Aarons Corporate Furnishings division.  The Company no longer includes the revenues and expenses of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division in its continuing operations, and now reports the net earnings or loss of the division as discontinued operations.  Prior periods are restated to reflect this change in accounting.
Division Results
Revenues in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased in the fourth quarter to $441.7 million, an 11% increase over the $398.8 million in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008.  For the year, sales and lease ownership revenues were $1.734 billion, an 11% increase over the $1.569 billion recorded last year.
The revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture stores decreased 27% to $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Aarons Office Furniture revenues for the year declined 25% to $16.5 million compared to $22.1 million a year ago.  The Aarons Office Furniture stores recorded pre-tax losses of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $695,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008, and pre-tax losses of $7.8 million in 2009 and $2.2 million in 2008.
The net earnings from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $27,000 compared to net earnings of $69,000 in the prior year. For the year, discontinued operations had a net loss of $277,000 compared to net earnings of $4.4 million in 2008.
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees increased 10% for the fourth quarter and 11% for the year compared to the previous year.  In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 17% in the fourth quarter and 18% for the year compared to the same periods last year.  Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 12% for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year and 6% for the year. The increases in the Companys franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $196.5 million during the fourth quarter and $759.0 million for the year, both 14% increases over the comparable 2008 periods.  Same store revenues for franchised stores were up 8.9% for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.  Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aarons, Inc.
The Companys other revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009 included $1.6 million of gains from the sales of Company-operated stores.  Other revenues for the fiscal year included gains from the sales of stores of $7.8 million in 2009 and $8.5 million in 2008.
Store Count
During the fourth quarter of 2009 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 25 new Company-operated stores and 21 new franchised stores.  It also acquired one franchised store and sold ten Company-operated stores to a franchisee.  In addition, during the quarter four Company-operated stores and two franchised sales and lease ownership stores were closed, along with two Company-operated RIMCO stores.  One new Aarons Office Furniture store was also opened.
For the 2009 year, the Company opened 85 new Company-operated stores and 84 new franchised stores.  The Companys total net store count from its continuing operations increased 8.8% for the year.
During the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2009 the Company awarded area development agreements to open 28 and 159 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of December 2009 there were development agreements awarded to open 269 franchised stores that we expect will open over the next several years.
At December 31, 2009 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,071 Company-operated stores, 590 franchised stores, 11 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and seven franchised RIMCO stores.  The Company also had 15 Aarons Office Furniture stores.  The total number of stores open at the end of 2009 was 1,694.
First Quarter and Full Year 2010 Outlook
The Company has updated its guidance for 2010 and expects to achieve the following at this time:
Conference Call
Aarons will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Tuesday, February 16, 2010, at 5:00 pm Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Companys website, , in the Investor Relations section.

ATLANTA, April 26, 2010  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential and office furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2010.
For the first quarter of 2010, revenues increased 4% to $495.3 million compared to $474.0 million for the first quarter in 2009. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 5% to $37.0 million versus $35.4 million last year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and diluted earnings after considering discontinued operations per share were $.45 compared to $.43 per share a year ago, a 5% increase. The Companys other revenues in the first quarter of last year included $5.7 million in gains from the sales of Company-operated stores to franchisees. There were no similar sales in the first quarter of 2010.
The Company announced a 3-for-2 stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend on both Common Stock (AAN) and Class A Common Stock (AAN.A) on March 23, 2010. New shares were distributed on April 15, 2010 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2010. The Companys first quarter earnings per share and weighted average shares outstanding have been restated to reflect this stock split.
 
 
 
 
 
As has been the case for a long time we are once again pleased with our quarterly results, which were at the high end of our expectations, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons. We have a very predictable, annuity type business that has performed well over the years in all sorts of economic climates. Our customer base remains large, the demand for our household furnishings is strong, and we believe the potential for continued growth still remains quite positive. We anticipate that 2010, our fifty-fifth year, will be another excellent year.
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 4.4% during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Same store revenues also increased 2.9% for Company-operated stores open for over two years at the end of March 2010. The Company had 840,000 customers and its franchisees had 453,000 customers at the end of the quarter, a 12% increase in total customers over the number at the end of March 2009 (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc.). The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 7.4% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
 
Division Results
Revenues in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased in the first quarter to $490.6 million, a 5% increase over the $469.3 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2009.
The revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture stores decreased 28% to $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2009. The Aarons Office Furniture stores recorded pre-tax losses of $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2010 and $859,000 in the first quarter of 2009. Although the office furniture market is very difficult in this economy, we have plans in place and have been making changes which we believe will result in improved financial performance of the stores in the latter half of 2010.
There was a net loss from discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2009 of $209,000.
 
 
 
 
 
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees increased 6% for the first quarter compared to the previous year. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 14% in the first quarter compared to the same periods last year. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 3% for the quarter compared to the first quarter last year. The increases in the Companys franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, which collectively had revenues of $220.2 million during the first quarter, a 14% increase over the comparable 2009 period. Same store revenues for franchised stores were up 5.2% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aarons, Inc.
As previously mentioned, the Companys other revenues in the first quarter of 2009 included $5.7 million in gains from the sales of Company-operated stores. There were no store sales in the first quarter of 2010.
 
Store Count
During the first quarter of 2010 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 12 new Company-operated stores and 9 new franchised stores. It also acquired three franchised stores and one store from an unaffiliated operator, and acquired the accounts of four third party stores. Seven Company-operated stores and one franchised store were closed during the quarter. In addition, three Aarons Office Furniture stores were closed.
During the first quarter of 2010 the Company awarded area development agreements to open 14 additional franchised stores. At the end of March 2010 there were development agreements awarded to open 268 franchised stores that we expect will open over the next several years.
At March 31, 2010 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,080 Company-operated stores, 595 franchised stores, 11 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and seven franchised RIMCO stores. The Company also had 12 Aarons Office Furniture stores. The total number of stores open at the end of March 2010 was 1,705.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On May 4, 2010, the shareholders of Aaron's, Inc. (the "Company"), approved the Aaron's, Inc. Executive Bonus Plan, to be effective as of January 1, 2010 (the "Plan"). Previously, on March 23, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Compensation Committee to finalize, approve and administer the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to further the growth and financial success of the Company by offering performance incentives to designated executives who have significant responsibility for such success. The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee or other committee designated by the Board (the "Committee"), subject to the Committee's right to delegate to the Chief Executive Officer and others responsibility for administration of the Plan as it relates to participants other than the Chief Executive Officer. Persons eligible to participate in the Plan are the executive officers and other executives of the Company, its operating units, or its affiliates who are in management positions designated as eligible for participation by the Committee or its designee. The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Committee at any time, subject to ratification by the Board and to the consent of each participant whose rights with respect to an award that has been determined and approved would be adversely affected. Unless terminated, the Plan will remain in effect until awards thereunder are paid for the Company's fiscal year ending in 2015.
Prior to, or as soon as practical after, the commencement of each fiscal year, the Committee will establish plan rules for that year with respect to the following matters: (a) employees who are eligible to participate; (b) performance targets and the measurement criteria for determining the level of achievement of the performance targets; (c) the dollar amount or the percentage of a participant's base salary which may be paid as an incentive award at specified levels of achievement of the performance targets; (d) the form of payment of an incentive award; and (e) the times and conditions subject to which any incentive award may become payable. Performance criteria for the Chief Executive Officer (and such other participants as the Committee may determine) will include one or more of the following: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), pre-tax earnings, return on capital employed, cash flow, cash flow return, operating income, inventory turnover ratio, cost reductions, leverage ratios, gross margin, product introduction, sales, net income, earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets (or net assets), investments, pre-tax profit, after-tax profit, market value of the Company's stock, total shareholder return, economic profit, capitalized economic profit, and strategic business objectives consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified cost targets, business expansion goals, and goals related to acquisitions and divestitures. The Committee may establish other performance criteria for participants other than the Chief Executive Officer (and such other participants as the Committee may determine) if such awards are not intended to be qualified performance-based awards for purposes of Code Section 162(m). The maximum incentive award payable to a participant in any year will be $3.0 million.
 
After the end of each fiscal year, the Committee will certify the extent to which the performance criteria have been achieved for that year. In measuring performance, the Committee may adjust the Company's financial results to exclude the effect of unusual charges or income items which distort year-to-year comparisons of results and other events, including acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets, recapitalizations, reorganizations, or reductions in force. With respect to the Chief Executive Officer and other participants designated by the Committee, the Committee shall exclude such items whose exclusion has the effect of increasing achievement of performance criteria if such items constitute "extraordinary items" under generally accepted accounting principles or are unusual events or items. The Committee will also make adjustments to eliminate the effect of unanticipated changes in the tax or accounting rules and regulations.
Incentive awards shall be approved by the Committee, subject to ratification by the Board when required under the Plan or elected by the Committee, based on the Plan rules then in effect and the achievement of performance criteria as certified by the Committee. The Committee may in its discretion grant awards to deserving participants, except the Chief Executive Officer, notwithstanding levels of achievement of performance criteria.
Awards will generally be made in lump sum cash payments or in such other form as the Committee may specify at the beginning of the year. Payment will be made as soon as practicable after determination of awards.
A partial incentive award may be authorized by the Committee for a participant who is terminated without cause or who retires, dies, or becomes permanently and totally disabled. Otherwise, no award will be paid to a participant who is not an active employee of the Company, an operating unit, or an affiliate at the end of the fiscal year to which the award relates. In general and unless with respect to some or all participants, the Committee has established a different rule, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), the participant's incentive award for that year will be deemed to have been fully earned for the year, with deemed performance at the target level; will be prorated for the portion of the year that has elapsed; and will be paid within thirty days after the effective date of the Change in Control.
The foregoing description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

On June 18, 2010, Aarons, Inc. (the Company) entered into the Second Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty with SunTrust Bank, as servicer, and the other participants listed therein (the Amended Franchisee Loan Facility), attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, which amends the Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty dated as of May 23, 2008, as amended as of May 22, 2009 (the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility). Pursuant to this facility, the Companys franchisees can borrow funds guaranteed by the Company. The Amended Franchisee Loan Facility amends the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date of the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility until May 20, 2011, (ii) increase the maximum commitment amount under the facility from $175,000,000 to $200,000,000, (iii) provide for the ability to extend loans to franchisees that operate stores located in Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec) and modify or incorporate provisions needed to accomplish the same, (iv) increase the maximum available amount of swing loans from $20,000,000 to $25,000,000, (v) reduce the Companys interest obligations with respect to franchisees that operate stores located in the U.S. and establish the Companys interest obligations with respect to franchisees that operate stores located in Canada, and (vi) modify certain exhibits to the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility, to include a form of Canadian Loan Agreement and certain related documents and to revise the form of Franchisee Borrower Loan and Security Agreement.
The Company remains subject to the same financial covenants under the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility, which forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and require the maintenance of a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under the agreement.
Amendment to Servicing Agreement
In connection with the Amended Franchisee Loan Facility, on June 18, 2010, the Company also entered into the Amended and Restated Servicing Agreement with SunTrust Bank, as servicer (the Amended Servicing Agreement), attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, which amends the Servicing Agreement dated as of May 28, 2004, as amended on May 22, 2009.

The Amended Servicing Agreement, among other things, modifies the operations and procedures applicable to the operation of the Existing Franchisee Loan Facility to conform such operations and procedures to the amendments agreed upon pursuant to the Amended Franchisee Loan Facility.

The Servicer agrees that, upon receipt of payment in full of such Loan Indebtedness, the Servicer shall:

Based solely on such information provided by Sponsor to Servicer, Servicer shall include Net Book Value of the Asset Dispositions during the preceding month not applied to Advances made during such month in the monthly invoice for Canadian Borrowers. If the Servicer receives such notice in writing from Sponsor at least twelve (12) Business Days prior to the date that the Asset Disposition Invoice is otherwise to be sent, the Servicer agrees to notify the applicable Borrower that the "Asset Disposition Prepayment" required under its Loan Agreement is waived.

Each Advance shall be made by Servicer for the sole purposes of (i) honoring requests from any US Borrower, made through the Aaron's Proprietary System, for ACH transfers to suppliers of Merchandise in payment of Approved Invoices, and (ii) honoring requests from any US Borrower for Advances made via ACH transfers to an operating account or other location specified by such Borrower (and granted a vendor identification number by Sponsor) for working capital purpose. The Borrowers shall not be authorized to use the DDA Account or FCTA for any other purpose. All Term Loans shall be disbursed in a single advance on the date agreed to by the Borrower and the Servicer via a wire transfer or a SWIFT transfer to an operating account or other location specified by such Borrower.

(c) Each Borrower with a Revolving Commitment will submit purchase order requests for Merchandise to Sponsor. In the event that the purchase order is authorized pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, Sponsor will prepare the purchase order and submit the same to the appropriate supplier requested by the Borrower. The supplier will be instructed to ship all Merchandise directly to the Borrower and the Borrower will be responsible for inspecting all Merchandise and resolving all disputes regarding the Merchandise with such supplier. The supplier will invoice the Borrower for such Merchandise in accordance with normal industry practice. When the Borrower wishes to pay such invoice, the Borrower, subject to availability of its Loan Commitment and the minimum borrowing threshold, shall pay such invoice by directing Servicer, through the Aaron's Proprietary System, to pay such invoice by means of an ACH transfer from its DDA Account if such Borrower is a US Borrower or by requesting that Sponsor, through fax, email or other electronic forms of notification by 12:00 Noon on the last Business Day immediately prior to the 10th or 25th day of each month, direct the Servicer to pay such invoice by means of a SWIFT transfer from its FCTA if such Borrower is a Canadian Borrower.

Upon receipt of the request for an ACH transfer or a SWIFT transfer (as applicable), Servicer shall honor such request by making an Advance pursuant to the Loan Commitment in the amount of such request into the Borrower's DDA Account or FTCA, as applicable, and automatically forwarding such amount to the supplier by means of an ACH transfer or SWIFT transfer, as applicable, in accordance with the instructions of the Borrower passed onto Servicer by Sponsor.

In addition, the outstanding Advances pursuant to each Revolving Commitment shall not exceed the Franchisee Borrowing Base for such Borrower, as determined by Sponsor on the fifth Business Day of each month (as determined on the last day of the preceding calendar month) and reported to Servicer on such date. Servicer shall be entitled to rely upon the calculation of the Franchisee Borrowing Base for each Borrower submitted by Sponsor for all purposes hereunder. Upon receipt of the Franchisee Borrowing Base, Servicer shall input such information into Servicer's loan records to be effective as of the date which is two Business Days after receipt of such information. The statements prepared to be delivered to each Borrower with respect to the next Payment Date shall be prepared requiring a repayment of any Advances outstanding on the fifth Business Day of such month in excess of the relevant Franchisee Borrowing Base as delivered to Servicer by Sponsor on such date.

Except to correct an immaterial ambiguity or manifest error, Servicer shall not agree to any amendment of the applicable Loan Documents after closing of any Loan without the prior written approval of Sponsor unless a Credit Event has occurred and is continuing or the Sponsor has no further obligations pursuant to its guaranty obligations with respect to such Loan.

Within fifteen (15) days after obtaining such signatures, Servicer shall send Sponsor photocopies of the original fully executed documents. Servicer shall be entitled to charge Sponsor, or upon Sponsor's written instructions, the applicable Borrower, reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred and other expenses relating to the preparation of such amendments or other documents.
Unless a Credit Event has occurred and is continuing or the Sponsor has no further obligation pursuant to its guaranty set forth in the Loan Facility Agreement, Servicer shall at all times endeavor to comply with the requirements set forth in this Servicing Agreement and the Loan Facility Agreement, provided that Servicer shall not be required to take any action which it reasonably determines would expose Servicer to unreasonable risk of liability or which is contrary to applicable law or which is contrary to the terms of the Operative Documents.
Each Loan Agreement for a Line of Credit shall authorize Servicer or representatives of Servicer, including Sponsor, to conduct periodic field audits of each Borrower. Unless otherwise instructed by Servicer, Sponsor hereby covenants and agrees with Servicer to audit each Borrower with a Line of Credit Commitment no less than once per each six month period and more frequently at the reasonable request of Servicer with respect to any such Borrower as to whom a Loan Default has occurred (whether or not waived by Sponsor). In conducting the field audits of the Borrowers with Line of Credit Commitments, Sponsor will examine the payment receipts, bank statements, loan statements, Lease Contracts, inventory on hand, computer-generated reports of Asset Dispositions, Rental Revenue and other financial data necessary to determine the accuracy and validity of the reports, compliance certificates, financial reports and other information forwarded to either of Servicer or Sponsor by such Borrowers in connection with the Franchisee Loans.
At the request of Servicer, within thirty (30) Business Days of the completion of each field audit, Sponsor shall forward to Servicer a written audit report detailing the scope of Sponsor's audit, any discrepancies or other misstatements or misrepresentations of the relevant Borrower discovered in the course of the audit and containing a clear concise statement as to whether or not Sponsor believes that such Borrower is in compliance with the terms of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and if not, the nature of any default known to Sponsor and the course of action planned by the Borrower to remedy
 
such default. The delivery of each field audit to Servicer by Sponsor shall constitute a representation and warranty by Sponsor that the information set forth therein is true and correct in all material respects to the best of Sponsor's knowledge and that Servicer shall be authorized to rely on such information in continuing to make Advances to such Borrower.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Servicer, in its sole discretion, may (at Servicer's expense, unless a Credit Event has occurred and is continuing and then at Sponsor's expense) at any time and from time to time, undertake to perform an independent field audit of any or all of the Borrowers with Line of Credit Commitments (with such audit to be performed by officers or employees of Servicer or other persons retained by Servicer for such purpose). Sponsor shall cooperate fully with Servicer in connection with any such independent audit.
Unless otherwise provided in the Loan Facility Agreement or under this Servicing Agreement, all communications under this Servicing Agreement shall be sent in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in Section 15.1 of the Loan Facility Agreement.
No party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Servicing Agreement unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party for whose benefit such provision was intended. No delay or omission on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right on any future occasion.
THIS SERVICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF).

No amendment, modification, supplement, termination, or waiver of any provision of this Servicing Agreement and no consent to any departure by Sponsor therefrom, may in any event be effective unless in writing signed by Servicer, and then only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose given.
 
Without limiting any other rights which Sponsor may have under the Operative Documents or under applicable law, and subject to the notice and other procedural requirements of Section 11.2 of the Loan Facility Agreement, Servicer hereby agrees to indemnify upon demand and hold Sponsor harmless from and against all damages, losses, claims, liabilities and related costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred and disbursements as and when incurred, awarded against or incurred by Sponsor, which directly arise out of Servicer's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its administration of the Franchisee Loan Program.
Sponsor expressly acknowledges and agrees that Servicer shall exercise with respect to the Franchisee Loan Program the same standard of care and diligence in the performance of its duties, responsibilities and obligations under the Operative Documents as it generally exercises with respect to loans of a similar size and structure in Servicer's sole and absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Servicer nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with the Operative Documents (other than any of the foregoing made by any of them), any Loan Document or any borrowing hereunder or thereunder, (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article 4 of the Loan Agreements, except receipt of the Loan Documents; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of the Operative Documents or any of the Loan Documents or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith or therewith, , , that in each case Servicer, its directors, officers, agents and employees are acting in good faith and without actual knowledge of a defect in or invalidity of any of the foregoing; or if Servicer, its directors, officers, agents or employees do have knowledge of any such defect or invalidity, provided that Sponsor: (x) has been promptly notified by Servicer of such defect or invalidity; and (y) has expressly consented to any and all actions to be taken by Servicer, its directors, officers, agents or employees as a result of, which is attributable to, or otherwise relates to, such defect or invalidity. Servicer shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement or other writing (which may be a wire, telex or similar writing) given in accordance with other provisions of this Agreement reasonably believed by it to be genuine or is otherwise in accordance with the instructions of Sponsor.

ITEM 2.05 COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES
 
In the second quarter of 2010, Aarons, Inc. closed all but four of its Aarons Office Furniture stores and plans to close the remaining stores by September 30, 2010.  Aarons is exiting the office furniture market as management believes there is a low probability of growth or profitability in the near future and intends to concentrate future efforts on the sales and lease ownership stores.
Aarons anticipates recording approximately $9.5 million in charges for the write-down and cost to dispose of office furniture, estimated future lease liabilities for closed stores, the write-off of leaseholds, severance pay, and other associated costs of closing the stores and winding down the division.   The Company anticipates recording over 70% of this amount as a charge to operating expenses in the second quarter of 2010 and most of the remainder is estimated to be incurred and recorded by the end of 2010.
Approximately $4.6 million of the estimated charges related to the write-down and disposal costs of office furniture to be taken in the second quarter of 2010.  Approximately $2.0 million of the estimated charges relate to closed store reserves incurred in the second quarter of 2010, with an additional $1.3 million and $1.0 million in similar expenses estimated in the remainder of 2010 and in 2011, respectively.
The estimates above are subject to change.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ATLANTA, June 29, 2010  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced it is ceasing the operations of its Aarons Office Furniture division and reducing its 2010 earnings guidance.
 
During the second quarter the Company closed all but four of its Aarons Office Furniture stores and plans to have the remaining stores closed by September 30, 2010.  It is anticipated that the Companys pre-tax earnings will be negatively impacted by up to $9.5 million, or approximately $.07 per diluted share, relating to the closure of the division.  The Company anticipates recording over 70% of this amount as a charge to operating expenses in the second quarter of 2010 and most of the remainder is estimated to be incurred and recorded by the end of 2010.  These charges will include the write-down and cost to dispose of office furniture, estimated future lease liabilities for closed stores, the write-off of leaseholds, severance pay, and other associated costs of closing the stores and winding down the division.
 
The Aarons Office Furniture division had revenues in 2009 of $16.5 million and a pre-tax loss of $7.8 million. For the first quarter of 2010 revenues were $3.9 million with a pre-tax loss of $1.4 million, and it is expected revenues will be less in the second quarter with comparable losses.
 
 
 
When we sold our legacy residential rent-to-rent business in 2008 we decided to keep the 13 Aarons Office Furniture stores, stated Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  At the time we believed there were still opportunities in the leasing and selling of office furniture.  However, the office furniture business is highly cyclical, and with the economic conditions of the last several years the stores have experienced declining revenue and have not been profitable.  With no growth or profitability in sight, rather than spending more effort attempting to build this business and incur additional losses, we concluded we should exit the office furniture market and concentrate our future efforts on our sales and lease ownership stores.
Outlook
 
Based upon preliminary results so far in the second quarter, it is anticipated that same store revenue and customer growth in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division will be a little less than expected, and although overall revenue targets are not expected to materially change, the Company is adjusting its earnings forecast to primarily reflect lower store revenue growth.  Including the above mentioned $9.5 million of charges relating to closing the office furniture division, the Company is reducing its earnings guidance for the second quarter to a range of $.29 to $.33 per diluted share from the previous guidance of $.37 to $.41 per diluted share, and for the year to $1.36 per diluted share to $1.48 per diluted share from the previous guidance of $1.48 per diluted share to $1.60 per diluted share.
 
Our Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership business continues to grow and gain customers, but we believe many customers are cautious as the current economic conditions are having an effect of them, Mr. Loudermilk continued.  Traffic in the stores has remained good and we still look forward to having an outstanding year.
 
 
 
Conference Call
 
Aarons will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Monday, July 26, 2010, at 5:00 pm Eastern Time.

ATLANTA, October 25, 2010  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010.
 
 For the third quarter of 2010, revenues increased 9% to $452.2 million compared to $415.3 million for the same period last year.  Net earnings rose 6% to $26.2 million versus $24.6 million recorded in the third quarter a year ago.   Diluted earnings per share were $.32 compared to $.30 for the third quarter of last year, a 7% increase.
 
For the first nine months of this year, revenues were up 7% to $1.392 billion compared to $1.307 billion for the same period of 2009.  Net earnings for the nine months were $87.6 million versus $87.5 million for the corresponding period a year ago.  Diluted earnings per share were $1.07 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.
 
We are pleased that our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  Same store revenue and customer growth continue to be strong, and we are on track with our 2010 new store opening plans.  In this tough economic environment, we have performed very well, providing basic home furnishings that are desired and needed by our customers.  We feel that our positive business trends will continue during the remainder of 2010 and look forward for another excellent year in 2011.
 
As previously announced, the Company began ceasing the operations of its Aarons Office Furniture division in June of 2010.  During the third quarter, the Company closed two additional Aarons Office Furniture stores and has two remaining stores that are anticipated to remain open in 2011 to liquidate merchandise.  The third quarter 2010 financial results include pre-tax charges to operating expenses of $949,000 and the nine month results include pre-tax operating expenses of $8.1 million, or $.06 per diluted share, related to the closing of this division.
 
In the third quarter of 2009 the Company recorded a $2.2 million pre-tax charge to operating expenses relating to the write-down of certain lease merchandise and the impairment of long-lived assets associated with its Aarons Office Furniture stores.  Additionally, in the third quarter of 2009 the Companys tax provision was favorably impacted by a $2.3 million reversal of previously recorded liabilities for uncertain income tax positions due to the expiration of tax statutes.
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 3.2% during the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009.  Same store revenues also increased 1.6% for Company-operated stores open over two years at the end of September 2010. The Company had 872,000 customers and our franchisees had 477,000 customers at the end of the third quarter of 2010, a 12% increase in total customers over the number at the end of September a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc.).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 6.7% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
Division Results
 
The Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the third quarter of 2010 to $448.4 million, a 9% increase over the $411.0 million in revenues in the third quarter of 2009.  Sales and lease ownership revenues for the first nine months of 2010 increased 7% to $1.380 billion compared to $1.292 billion for the same period a year ago.
 
The revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture stores were $2.5 million and $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The Aarons Office Furniture division recorded a pre-tax loss of $993,000 in the third quarter of 2010 and a $3.7 million pre-tax loss in the third quarter of 2009.  For the first nine months of 2010, revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture stores were $10.0 million compared to $12.3 million for the same period of 2009, and pre-tax losses were $11.1 million in 2010 versus $6.5 million in 2009.  Included in the 2010 and 2009 third quarter and year-to-date losses are the above mentioned charges that were recorded.
Components of Revenue
 
Consolidated lease revenues and fees increased 6% for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods in the previous year.  In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 13% for the third quarter and 12% year-to-date 2010 compared to the same periods last year.   Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 21% to $84.3 million for the third quarter of 2010 from $69.5 million in the comparable period in 2009, and increased 10% to $253.9 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared to $230.3 million for the same period last year. The increases during the year in the Companys franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of the increases in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $204.4 million for the third quarter and $625.8 million for the first nine months of 2010, a respective 10% and 11% increase over the comparable prior year periods.  Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores were up 4.5% and 8.7%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009.  Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aarons, Inc.
 
 The Companys other revenues in the third quarter of 2010 and 2009 included $1.2 million and $193,000 of gains, respectively, from the sales of Company-operated stores.  Other revenues for the first nine months included gains from the sales of stores of $1.6 million in 2010 and $6.3 million in 2009.
Store Count
 
During the third quarter of 2010, the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 29 new Company-operated stores and 18 new franchised stores.  The Company also acquired four franchised stores and the accounts of three independent operators.  Aarons sold six Company-operated stores to Aarons franchisees and one Company-operated store to an unaffiliated operator, and one RIMCO store left the franchise system.  Eight Company-operated stores and two Aarons Office Furniture stores were closed in the third quarter.
 
Through the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2010, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 25 and 67 additional franchised stores, respectively.  At the end of September 2010, there were 266 franchised stores awarded that are expected to be opened over the next several years.
 
At September 30, 2010, the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,116 Company-operated stores, 631 franchised stores, 12 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and six franchised RIMCO stores.  The Company also had two Aarons Office Furniture stores.  The total number of stores open at September 30, 2010 was 1,767.

Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
     On December 7, 2010, at a special meeting of shareholders of Aaron's, Inc. (the "Company"), the shareholders of the Company approved, among other things, a proposal to amend and restate the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to (a) effect a reclassification of each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.50 per share (the "Nonvoting Common Stock") into one share of Class A Common Stock (the "Class A Common Stock") and to rename the Class A Common Stock as Common Stock (the "Common Stock"), (b) to eliminate certain obsolete provisions relating to the Company's prior dual-class common stock structure, and (c) to amend the number of authorized shares to be 225,000,000 total shares of Common Stock (the aggregate of the number of authorized shares of Nonvoting Common Stock and Class A Common Stock prior to the approval of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation). Following receipt of shareholder approval at the special meeting, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia and are now effective.
     As a result of the reclassification of shares of Nonvoting Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock and the other changes described above and effected by the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, shares of the combined class now titled Common Stock have one vote per share on all matters submitted to the Company's shareholders, including the election of directors. The former Nonvoting Common Stock did not entitle the holders thereof to any vote except as otherwise provided in the Company's Articles of Incorporation or required by law. In addition, holders of the new Common Stock will all vote as a single class of stock on any matters subject to a shareholder vote. Holders of the former Class A Common Stock and the Nonvoting Common Stock were previously entitled to separate class voting rights in certain circumstances as required by law, and those class voting rights were eliminated with the share reclassification.
     The holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the Company as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the Company out of legally available funds. Prior to the reclassification, the Company's Articles of Incorporation permitted the payment of a cash dividend on the Nonvoting Common Stock without paying any dividend on the Class A Common Stock or the payment of a cash dividend on the Nonvoting Common Stock that was up to 50% higher than any dividend paid on the Class A Common Stock. Cash dividends could not be paid on the Class A Common Stock unless equal or higher dividends were paid on the Nonvoting Common Stock.
     The conversion had no other impact on the economic equity interests of holders of Common Stock, including with regards to liquidation rights or redemption, regardless of whether holders previously held shares of Nonvoting Common Stock or Class A Common Stock.
     Effective December 13, 2010, all shares of the Common Stock will begin trading as a single class on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "AAN." As a result of the conversion, trading of the Nonvoting Common Stock under the ticker symbol "AAN" was suspended following the close of the New York Stock Exchange on December 10, 2010. The CUSIP number of the Common Stock is the same as the prior Class A Common Stock, 002535300.

Item 5.07 Results of Shareholder Vote.
     On Tuesday, December 7, 2010, the Company held a special meeting of shareholders in Atlanta, Georgia. As of the record date, October 28, 2010, there were 11,635,056 shares of Class A Common Stock and 69,427,694 shares of Nonvoting Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Represented at the meeting in person or by proxy were 11,526,245 shares representing 99.06% of the total shares of Class A Common Stock and 63,425,969.637 shares representing 91.36% of the total shares of Nonvoting Common Stock entitled to vote at the meeting.
     The purpose of the meeting was to vote on the following matters:
     (1) the amendment and restatement of the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to convert all shares of Nonvoting Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, remove the current class of Nonvoting Common Stock, rename the current class of Class A Common Stock as Common Stock, eliminate certain obsolete provisions of the Company's existing Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation relating to the Company's dual-class common stock structure and amend the number of authorized shares to be 225,000,000 total shares;
     (2) the amendment of the Company's bylaws to establish a classified Board of Directors with three classes of directors each to serve a three-year term;
     (3) the amendment of the Company's bylaws to provide that vacancies on the Company's Board of Directors shall only be filled by the Company's Board of Directors;
     (4) the amendment of the Company's bylaws tor educe the default approval threshold required for matters submitted to shareholders for a vote; and
     (5) the transaction of such other business as may lawfully come before the meeting, hereby revoking any proxies as to said shares theretofore given by the shareholders and ratifying and confirm all that said attorneys and proxies may lawfully do by virtue thereof.

Our results for the fourth quarter exceeded our guidance, with better than expected same store revenue growth and profitability, said Robert C.

Although current business challenges and conditions affect us as they do other retailers, through the years the strength of the Aarons business model has been proven resilient and has delivered consistent and superior financial results.  Aarons provides desired and needed basic home furnishings, and our customers demand for these products continues to remain strong.
 
 
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 6.2% during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.  Same store revenues also increased 4.4% for Company-operated stores open for over two years at the end of December 2010.  The Company had 912,000 customers and its franchisees had 502,000 customers at the end of the year, a 10% increase in total customers over the number at the end of 2009 (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 7.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
 
The Company began ceasing the operations of its Aarons Office Furniture division in June of 2010.  During the fourth quarter, the Company closed one additional Aarons Office Furniture store and currently has one store that is anticipated to remain open in 2011 to liquidate merchandise.  The fourth quarter 2010 financial results include pre-tax charges to operating expenses of $893,000 and the annual results include pre-tax operating expenses of $9.0 million, or $.07 per diluted share after tax, related to the closing of this division.
 
The Company reacquired 1,478,805 shares of Common Stock in 2010 including 1,000,000 shares during the fourth quarter, and has the Board of Directors current authorization to purchase an additional 4,401,815 shares of Common Stock.

Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 11% for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year and 10% for the year. The increases in the Companys franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $215.5 million during the fourth quarter and $841.3 million for the year, 10% and 11% increases over the comparable respective 2009 periods.  Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores were up 4.2% and 7.3%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.

ATLANTA, April 25, 2011  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2011.
 
For the first quarter of 2011, revenues increased 8% to $532.7 million compared to $495.3 million for the first quarter in 2010.  Net earnings increased 20% to $44.4 million versus $37.0 million last year.  Diluted earnings per share were $.55 compared to $.45 per share a year ago, a 22% increase.
 
The numbers speak for themselves and it was an excellent quarter in all aspects of our business, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  We exceeded our expectations for both revenue and earnings growth, and customer traffic remains strong.  Over many years, regardless of the economic conditions, we have delivered excellent results for our shareholders, mainly due to the superior execution of our unique business model.  Our customer base remains large, the demand for the basic household furnishings we offer continues, and we believe the potential for further growth still is excellent.
 
 
 
 
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 6.0% during the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010.  Same store revenues also increased 3.9% for Company-operated stores open for over two years at the end of March 2011.  The Company had 914,000 customers and its franchisees had 499,000 customers at the end of the quarter, a 9% increase in total customers over the number at the end of March 2010 (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc.).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 6.3% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
 
During the first quarter of this year the Company generated over $140 million of cash flow from operations and had $196 million of cash on hand at the end of March 2011.
 
The Company reacquired 357,019 shares of Common Stock in the first quarter of 2011 and has the Board of Directors authorization to purchase an additional 4,044,796 shares.
Division Results
 
Revenues in the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased in the first quarter to $529.9 million, an 8% increase over the $490.6 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2010.
 
The revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture division, of which there is one remaining store liquidating merchandise, decreased 64% to $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2010.  The Aarons Office Furniture division recorded pre-tax gains of $295,000 in the first quarter of 2011 and losses of $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Components of Revenue
 
Consolidated lease revenues and fees increased 9% for the first quarter compared to the previous year.  In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 9% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.  Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 5% for the quarter compared to the first quarter last year. The increases in the Companys franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, which collectively had revenues of $241.3 million during the first quarter, a 10% increase over the comparable 2010 period.  Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores were up 3.9% and 5.4%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010.  Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aarons, Inc.
 
 
 
 
 
The Companys other revenues in the first quarter of 2011 included $481,000 of gains from the sale of two Company-operated stores.  There were no gains in the first quarter of last year.
Store Count
 
During the first quarter of 2011 the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened ten new Aarons Company-operated stores, nine new Aarons franchised stores, one RIMCO store, and two HomeSmart stores.  It also acquired one franchised store and one third party store, and acquired the accounts of two third party stores.  Three Company-operated stores were sold to an Aarons franchisee.  Five Company-operated stores and three franchised stores were closed during the quarter.
 
During the first quarter of 2011, the Company awarded area development agreements to open six additional franchised stores. At the end of March 2011 there were development agreements awarded to open 271 franchised stores that we expect will open over the next several years.
 
At March 31, 2011, the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,140 Company-operated stores, 666 franchised stores, 11 Company-operated RIMCO stores, six franchised RIMCO stores and five HomeSmart stores. The Company also had one Aarons Office Furniture store.  The total number of stores open at the end of March 2011 was 1,829.
Second Quarter and Full Year 2011 Outlook
 
The Company is updating its guidance for 2011 and expects to achieve the following at this time:

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Second Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement
On May 18, 2011, Aaron's Inc. (the "Company") entered into the Second Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement with the lending institutions listed on the respective signature pages thereof, and SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent for the lending institutions (the "Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment"), attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, which amends the Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of May 23, 2008, as amended as of March 31, 2011 (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"). The agreement provides, subject to certain terms and conditions, for unsecured borrowings by the Company of $140 million (including a letter of credit and swingline loan subfacility).
The Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment amends the Revolving Credit Agreement to (i) add the defined terms "Institutional Investor" and "Private Placement Debt", to further clarify the circumstances under which the Company may incur indebtedness and still remain in compliance with certain negative covenants applicable to the Company, and (ii) modify the negative covenant restricting debt applicable to the Company by, among other things, increasing the amount of indebtedness the Company may incur with respect to certain privately placed debt (including debt incurred in respect of the Company's 5.03% senior notes) from an aggregate principal amount of up to $60 million to an aggregate principal amount up to $150 million.
The Company remains subject to the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and require the maintenance of a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under the agreement, and all amounts would become due immediately.
Second Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty
On May 18, 2011, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty with SunTrust Bank, as servicer, and the other participants listed on the respective signature pages thereof (the "Franchisee Loan Facility Amendment"), attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, which amends the Second Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty dated as of June 18, 2010, as amended as of March 31, 2011 (the "Franchisee Loan Facility"). Pursuant to this facility, subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company's franchisees can borrow funds guaranteed by the Company. The Franchisee Loan Facility Amendment amends the Franchisee Loan Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date of the Franchisee Loan Facility until May 16, 2012, (ii) increase the maximum Canadian subfacility commitment amount for loans to franchisees that operate stores in Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec) from Cdn $25 million to Cdn $35 million, (iii) add the defined terms "Institutional Investor" and "Private Placement Debt", to further clarify the circumstances under which the Company may incur indebtedness and still remain in compliance with applicable negative covenants, (iv) modify the negative covenant restricting debt applicable to the Company by, among other things, increasing the amount of indebtedness the Company may incur with respect to certain privately placed debt (including debt incurred in respect of the Company's 5.03% senior notes) from an aggregate principal amount of up to $60 million to an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million, and (v) replace the pricing grid schedule to the Franchisee Loan Facility, to reduce the applicable margins and participant unused commitment fee percentages with respect to the funded participations.
 
The Company remains subject to the financial covenants under the Franchisee Loan Facility, which forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and require the maintenance of a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under the agreement.
The foregoing description of the Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment and Franchisee Loan Facility Amendment are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

On June 9, 2011, Aarons, Inc. (the Company) announced its plans to appeal an adverse trial verdict in a lawsuit the Company is defending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.  A press release regarding the case is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
 
(d)           Exhibits
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
ATLANTA, June 9, 2011  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN) announced today that the Company plans to appeal a verdict involving a former Aarons manager who allegedly sexually harassed a co-worker. The Company stated that the award does not accurately reflect the evidence presented in the case.
 
The verdict, which consisted of approximately $90 million in damages awarded to the plaintiff, was rendered in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.  Of the total damages awarded, $50 million exceeds the maximum award permitted by law.
 
Aarons is extremely disappointed with the jurys verdict and believes that the award does not accurately reflect the evidence that was presented in this case, said Chad Strickland, Vice President of Associate Resources for Aarons, Inc.  We feel strongly that this verdict is the result of a decision made by a classic runaway jury, and because of that we are confident that the damages will be greatly reduced. We intend to appeal the verdict and seek a fairer and more equitable outcome.
 
Mr. Strickland said the alleged acts the jury determined were engaged in by the former Aarons manager are not only completely inconsistent with everything our Company believes in and stands for, but are also far outside the scope of his employment and were never condoned by the Company.
 
Throughout the Company, Aarons insists on the proper treatment of employees, regardless of their employment position, location or work status. All management employees are fully trained in appropriate workplace practices. Additionally, all employees are trained in how to report their concerns about workplace practices.  Aarons does not tolerate an inappropriate or disrespectful work environment.
 
Aarons is committed to establishing and building a strong, professional and respectful employee culture, in every community we serve and in every store we operate, said Robin Loudermilk, President and CEO.
 
Statements in this news release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Statements in this release that are forward-looking include Aarons expectations regarding the results of the appeals process.  Due to inherent uncertainty in litigation and other risks and uncertainties, including any set forth in Aarons filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission from time to time, actual results could differ materially from Aarons expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On July 25, 2011, Aarons, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the second quarter of 2011.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release presents the Companys net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 excluding a charge to operating expenses of $36.5 million related to a lawsuit judgment against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, less the portion covered by insurance.  As lawsuit judgments and related expenses of this magnitude are unprecedented in the Companys history, and because the Company is in the process of appealing the judgment, management believes that presentation of this particular non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it allows investors to more easily evaluate and compare the performance of the Companys business from period to period.  Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.
 
ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

ATLANTA, July 25, 2011  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011.
 
For the second quarter of 2011, revenues increased 8% to $482.7 million compared to $445.0 million for the second quarter in 2010.  Net earnings were $10.8 million versus $24.4 million last year.  Diluted earnings per share were $.13 compared to $.30 per share a year ago.
 
  For the first six months of this year, revenues increased 8% to $1.015 billion compared to $940.3 million for the first six months of 2010.  Net earnings were $55.2 million versus $61.4 million last year.  Diluted earnings per share for the first six months were $.68 for 2011 versus $.75 in 2010.
 
Excluding a lawsuit related charge, net earnings for the second quarter would have been $33.3 million and earnings per share assuming dilution excluding the lawsuit related charge would have been $.41.
 
 
 
 
 
As previously announced, the Company was subject to a jury verdict rendered in June 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois which awarded $93.5 million in damages to a former employee who alleged she was sexually harassed by her supervising manager.  Of the total damages awarded, $53.7 million exceeded the maximum award permitted under federal laws.  Subsequently the presiding judge in the trial reduced the damages to $39.8 million in accordance with the statute.  Consequently, in the second quarter, a charge to lawsuit expense of $36.5 million was recorded which represents the judgment and related legal expenses after insurance coverage. The Company strongly believes that the award does not accurately reflect the evidence in the case and plans to file post-trial motions with the Court in an attempt to reduce the size of the award or otherwise appeal the verdict.
 
Aarons operating results for the quarter were as we expected and we are extremely pleased with our performance, especially in the current economic environment, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  Providing our customers with needed basic home furnishings with no credit checks and no long-term commitment has been the foundation of our business through the years, and we have proven that our Aarons concept is a superior model and recession resilient.  We believe that business will continue to be strong throughout the remainder of the year.
 
We are also quite pleased with the early results of our new and evolving HomeSmart weekly pay concept.  During the quarter we opened ten new stores and last week announced the strategic acquisition of the 30 store Crusader rent-to-own chain which we will convert to HomeSmart stores during the upcoming months.  With this acquisition and another smaller acquisition pending, we now expect to have approximately 60 HomeSmart stores open at the end of this year.  This weekly concept gives us another growth vehicle and looks very promising, Mr. Loudermilk added.
 
Finally we are, needless to say, disappointed in the jury verdict in the lawsuit and plan to appeal the decision.  Even though we believe the damages awarded are outrageously high and without merit, and we have a strong case for appeal, the charge to earnings this quarter is our best estimate at this time of our maximum dollar amount of exposure, Mr. Loudermilk added.
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 5.0% during the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010.  Same store revenues increased 3.2% for Company-operated stores open over two years as of June 30, 2011.  The Company had 935,000 customers and its franchisees had 511,000 customers at the end of the second quarter of 2011, a 9.2% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the second quarter a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc.).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 6.2% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
 
 
 
 
 
During the first six months of this year the Company generated over $200 million of cash flow from operations and had $176.4 million of cash on hand at the end of June 2011.  Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the Company received $125 million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in a private placement.  The notes bear interest at the rate of 3.75% per year and mature in April 2018. Payments of interest are due quarterly, commencing in July 2011, with principal payments of $25 million each due annually beginning in April 2014. These funds will be used for general corporate purposes and for the repurchase from time to time of Company stock.
 
In May 2011, the Board of Directors approved and authorized the repurchase of an additional 5,955,204 shares of Common Stock over the previously authorized repurchase amount of 4,044,796 shares, increasing the total number of shares of Aarons, Inc. Common Stock authorized for repurchase to 10,000,0000 shares.   The Company reacquired 357,019 and 1,097,093 shares of Common Stock in the first and second quarter of 2011, respectively, and has the authorization to purchase an additional 8,902,907 shares.
Division Results
 
The Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the second quarter of 2011 to $479.9 million, a 9% increase over the $440.6 million in revenues in the second quarter of 2010.  Sales and lease ownership revenues for the first half of 2011 increased 8% to $1.010 billion compared to $931.2 million for the same period a year ago.
 
The revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture division, of which there is one remaining store liquidating merchandise, were $873,000 in the second quarter of 2011 and $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2010.  The Aarons Office Furniture division recorded a pre-tax profit of $182,000 in the second quarter of 2011 and a pre-tax loss of $8.6 million in the second quarter of 2010.  For the first six months of 2011, revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture division were $2.3 million compared to $7.5 million for the same period of 2010, and pre-tax profits were $477,000 in 2011 versus pre-tax losses of $10.1 million in 2010.  Included in the 2010 results is $7.1 million of second quarter charges related to closing the division.
 
 
 
 
 
Components of Revenue
 
Consolidated lease revenues and fees for the second quarter and first half of 2011 increased 8% over the comparable previous year periods.  In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 7% for the second quarter and 8% for the year to date compared to the same periods in 2010.  Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 15% to $84.6 million for the second quarter from $73.6 million in the comparable period in 2010, and increased 9% to $185.1 million for the first six months compared to $169.6 million for the first six months of last year.  The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who, collectively, had revenues of $218.0 million during the second quarter and $459.4 million during the first six months of 2011, an 8% and 9% increase, respectively, over the prior year periods.  Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores increased 2.0% and 3.9%, respectively, for the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year.  Revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aarons, Inc.
 
The Companys other revenues in the second quarter of 2011 and 2010 included $517,000 and $406,000 of gains, respectively, from the sale of the assets of Company-operated stores.  Other revenues for the first six months included gains from the sale of stores of $997,000 in 2011 and $406,000 in 2010.
Store Count
 
During the second quarter of 2011, the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 17 new Company-operated stores, 12 franchised stores, ten HomeSmart stores, and one RIMCO store.  It also acquired the accounts of one third party store.   Aarons also sold five Company-operated stores to an Aarons franchisee and one store to an independent operator.  Eight Company-operated stores and two franchised stores were closed during the quarter.
 
Through the three months and six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 38 and 44 additional franchised stores, respectively.  At the end of June 2011, there were area development agreements awarded to open 276 franchised stores that we expect will open over the next several years.
 
At June 30, 2011, the Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,143 Company-operated stores, 681 franchised stores, 15 HomeSmart stores, 12 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and six franchised RIMCO stores.  The Company also had one Aarons Office Furniture store.  The total number of stores open at the end of June 2011 was 1,858.

On August 1, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Aaron's, Inc. (the "Company") approved the establishment of a stock-based management performance plan (the "Plan") effective July 1, 2011. Under the Plan, certain vice presidents, director-level employees and other key personnel in the Company's home office, divisional vice presidents and regional managers are eligible to receive grants of restricted stock units ("RSUs") based upon the quarterly pre-tax profit performance of their operating units or the overall Company, as appropriate. The Company's top four named executive officers  Chairman R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., President and Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Gilbert L. Danielson and Chief Operating Officer William K. Butler, Jr.  are not eligible to participate in the Plan.
If the established performance criteria is achieved, the participating employees may be granted RSUs quarterly, which would vest between four and five years from the date of grant and which would generally be settled in shares of the Company's stock on or around the first day of September immediately following the vesting date. Except in the case of death, disability or a change in control of the Company, a participating employee must be employed on the vesting date to earn the RSUs and to have a right to receive the underlying stock relating to the RSUs. Also, as a condition to the grant of the RSUs, each participant must enter into an employee agreement, which, among other things, contains restrictive covenants prohibiting the employee from soliciting the Company's employees and customers and from competing with the Company. All RSUs awarded under the Plan will be granted under and pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2001 Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan (as amended and restated) which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed April 10, 2009.
The Plan is discretionary and may be amended or terminated at any time by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee will administer the Plan and has delegated to the Company's Chief Executive Officer some of its authority under the Plan with respect to grants to employees other than executive officers.
A summary of the Plan as it applies to participating vice presidents in the Company's home office, some of whom are executive officers of the Company, is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report, and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the form of Master Restricted Stock Unit Agreement related to awards under the Plan (which includes the form of employee agreement as an exhibit) is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Report, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, as well as to the Company's 2001 Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan (as amended and restated) as previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 10.1
This document constitutes part of a prospectus covering securities that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
Purpose
This Aaron's Management Performance Plan (the "") has been adopted to encourage increased profitability and to align the goals and interests of certain management and executive employees of Aaron's, Inc. ("" or the "") with the goals and interests of Aaron's shareholders by rewarding strong performance with Aaron's stock. This summary describes the terms of the AMP Plan that apply to eligible Vice Presidents in the Home Office of Aaron's. Other summaries describe the specific terms and conditions that are applicable to eligible regional managers, divisional vice presidents, and directors and other key personnel in the Home Office.
AMP Plan
Aaron's
Company
Term of AMP Plan
The AMP Plan commenced July 1, 2011 and is initially expected to continue through December 31, 2012, but may be terminated or extended at any time in the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Aaron's, Inc. (the "").
Compensation Committee

Other summaries describe the eligibility requirements for other groups of eligible participants. The following executive officers shall not be eligible to participate in the AMP Plan: William K. Butler, Jr., Gilbert L. Danielson, R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., and Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr.
Home Office VPs
Performance Requirements
Restricted stock units ("") will be granted to a Home Office VP under and pursuant to the Aaron's Inc. 2001 Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan (the "") based on the level of quarterly pretax profit for Aaron's, Inc..
RSUs
Stock Plan
A minimum quarterly pretax profit of 9.0% of total revenue is required to earn any RSUs for such quarter. In addition, the total revenue for such quarter must exceed the total revenue for the same quarter of the previous calendar year. If these conditions are met, RSUs shall be granted based on the following formula.
Number of RSUs = Quarterly pretax profit % X multiplier in table below:
Results will be measured based upon Aaron's GAAP financials, as publicly reported. The number of RSUs granted will be rounded to the nearest whole number.
 
Terms and Conditions of RSUs
RSUs will be granted upon approval of the Compensation Committee after final quarterly results are calculated.
As soon as practicable after RSUs are granted, each Home Office VP will be notified of the number of RSUs he or she was granted, if any. Notification of the grant may be made by electronic means, such as through e-mail or an online grant notification and acceptance system. Each grant of RSUs will be subject to the terms of the Grant Notice, the Stock Plan and the terms of a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. A Master RSU Agreement may be used, in which case such Master RSU Agreement will apply to all grants of RSUs under this AMP Plan until the Master RSU Agreement is amended or replaced. As a condition to the grant of the RSUs and as part of the acceptance of the RSUs, the Home Office VP must agree to the terms of an Employee Agreement, which is a part of the RSU Agreement, and which contains certain restrictions against disclosing confidential information, soliciting customers and employees, and competing with Aaron's.
Each RSU entitles the grantee to one share of common stock of Aaron's, Inc. on the Delivery Date specified in the Grant Notice, if such RSU has vested and has not been forfeited prior to the specified Delivery Date. The Vesting Date of the RSUs will be set forth in the Grant Notice or RSU Agreement and will generally be approximately five (5) years after the grant date of the RSUs. Generally, a grantee must be employed on the Vesting Date to vest in his or her right to the shares. However, RSUs may also vest upon the grantee's death or upon certain change in control transactions, as provided in the RSU Agreement. The Delivery Date is expected to be the September 1 following the Vesting Date.
st
Below are the expected Vesting and Delivery Dates for RSUs earned during the program beginning July 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2012. These dates are subject to change until the RSUs have been granted. The Grant Notice and/or RSU Agreement provided to grantees at the time of grant will specify the Vesting Date and Delivery Date applicable to that grant of RSUs.
 
Examples
: For the quarter beginning July 1, 2011 and ending September 30, 2011, Aaron's reported a quarterly pretax profit of 13% of total revenue, and exceeded its total revenue for the third quarter of 2010. Absent unusual circumstances, Home Office VPs will be granted 813 RSUs (13% x 6,250 = 812.5, rounded to the nearest whole number) at the first meeting of the Compensation Committee on or after the final calculations of these quarterly results. These RSUs will have a Vesting Date of August 15, 2016, and a Delivery Date of approximately September 1, 2016.
Example 1
: For the quarter beginning October 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2011, Aaron's reported a quarterly pretax profit of 16% of total revenue, and exceeded its total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010. Absent unusual circumstances, Home Office VPs will be granted 1,600 RSUs (16% x 10,000 = 1,600) at the first meeting of the Compensation Committee or after the final calculation of these quarterly results. These RSUs will have a Vesting Date of August 15, 2016, and a Delivery Date of approximately September 1, 2016.
Example 2
Additional Terms and Conditions
The AMP Plan is discretionary and may be amended or terminated at any time by the Compensation Committee. The termination or amendment of the AMP Plan will not adversely affect RSUs that have already been granted and remain outstanding, unless the grantee consents to such amendment or unless the terms of the RSUs otherwise expressly permit such amendment.
The Compensation Committee shall have the authority to determine eligibility, interpret, administer and implement this Plan with respect to the Home Office VPs. The Compensation Committee may make adjustments deemed advisable in order to give consideration to changes in accounting rules, principles or methods, or extraordinary events, and make adjustments to financial performance measures in recognition of such occurrences. For example, the Compensation Committee has determined that, in calculating pretax profit under this Plan, the Company's GAAP financials shall be adjusted to ignore any positive or negative effect of any increase or decrease in the charge taken by the Company related to a 2011 judgment in an employment-related lawsuit.
In the event of a restatement of the Company's financials or a change in the pretax profit or revenue of one or more Company stores for a quarter after the grant of RSUs based on such quarterly performance, the grantee will forfeit the number of RSUs that were granted in excess of the number that would have been granted based on the corrected financials.
All grants of RSUs pursuant to the AMP Plan and the delivery of shares of Aaron's common stock upon settlement of the RSUs are subject to the terms of the Stock Plan. An initial number of shares have been reserved under the Stock Plan for issuance of RSUs pursuant to this AMP Plan; however, no RSUs will be granted if there are insufficient shares available under the Stock Plan or such grants would otherwise be prohibited under applicable laws, including securities laws. The grant of RSUs could be delayed if Compensation Committee approval is needed.
The Plan and all actions taken hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia without regard to conflicts of laws provisions.
The Plan is not intended to be, and does not constitute in any manner, a contract or guarantee of employment between Aaron's and any grantee.

9.1 Grantee hereby acknowledges that the Company may disclose (and/or has already disclosed) to Grantee and Grantee may be provided with access to and otherwise make use of, certain valuable, confidential information of the Company. Grantee also acknowledges that due to Grantee's relationship with the Company, Grantee will develop (and/or has developed) special contacts and relationships with the Company's employees, customers, suppliers and vendors and that it would be unfair and harmful to the Company if Grantee took advantage of these relationships to the detriment of the Company. To protect the Company from such harm, the Company and the Grantee hereby agree to and accept all the terms and provisions of the Employee Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (or separately provided to the Grantee but identified as Exhibit A to this Agreement). For purposes of this Section 9, references to the Company shall be deemed to include references to any subsidiary of the Company.
9.2 If, during his employment with the Company or at any time during the restrictive periods described in the Employee Agreement, the Grantee violates the restrictive covenants set forth in the Employee Agreement, then the Committee may, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, cancel any outstanding RSUs that have not yet vested. The parties further agree and acknowledge that the rights conveyed by this Agreement are of a unique and special nature and that the Company will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of a failure by the Grantee to abide by its terms and conditions nor will money damages adequately compensate for such injury. It is, therefore, agreed between the parties that, in the event of a breach by the Grantee of any of his obligations contained in the Employee Agreement, the Company shall have the right, among other rights, to damages sustained thereby and to obtain an injunction or decree of specific performance from any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or compel the Grantee to perform as agreed herein. The Grantee agrees that this Section 9 and the Employee Agreement shall survive the termination of his or her employment. Nothing contained herein shall in any way limit or exclude any other right granted by law or equity to the Company.
10. Modification of Agreement
No provision of this Agreement may be materially amended or waived unless agreed to in writing and signed by the Committee (or its designee). Any such amendment to this Agreement that is materially adverse to Grantee shall not be effective unless and until Grantee consents, in writing or by electronic means, to such amendment. The failure to exercise, or any delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy under this Agreement shall not waive any right, power or remedy which the Company has under this Agreement.
 
11. Severability
Should any provision of this Agreement be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected by such holding and shall continue in full force in accordance with their terms.
12. Governing Law
The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.
13. Successors in Interest
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Company and its successors and assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Grantee's legal representatives. All obligations imposed upon Grantee and all rights granted to the Company under this Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Grantee's heirs, executors, administrators and successors.
14. Resolution of Disputes
Any dispute or disagreement which may arise under, or as a result of, or in any way relate to the interpretation, construction or application of this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee (or its designee). Any determination made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive on Grantee and the Company for all purposes.
15. Code Section 409A
This Agreement and each award of RSUs is intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A as a short-term deferral. Each award of RSUs with a different Grant Date is intended to be a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. If any RSU is not exempt from Code Section 409A, each such RSU subject to Code Section 409A shall comply with Code Section 409A and any regulations or guidance that may be adopted thereunder from time to time. This Agreement shall be interpreted and administered by the Committee (or its designee) as it determines necessary or appropriate in accordance with Code Section 409A to avoid a plan failure under Code Section 409A(a)(1). However, the Company does not guarantee any particular tax treatment, and the Grantee is solely responsible for any taxes owed as a result of this Agreement.

Employee Agreement
Employee and Aaron's agree and acknowledge that during Employee's employment with Aaron's as a management or executive employee, Employee has learned or will learn important confidential information relating to Company's business of (1) renting, leasing and selling residential furniture, electronic goods, household appliances, home furnishings, and related equipment and accessories, automobile and truck tires and rims and related accessories, and (2) manufacturing furniture and bedding (""). Employee acknowledges that such confidential information is not generally available to the public and may include:
Reasons for this Employee Agreement.
Company's Business
, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, contact persons and other identifying information for Company's customers; compilations and lists of information with respect to the needs and requirements of Company's customers; information dealing with the nature of customers' accounts, including the dates on which agreements between Aaron's and such customers will end and be subject to renewal; and rate and price information and history relating to products and services provided by Aaron's to its customers;
Information About Company's Customers
, including information on the development, maintenance and use of unique techniques, concepts and knowledge with respect to renting, leasing, and selling practices; and information relating to the machinery, equipment, and processes by which Aaron's manufactures products for its business; and
Information About Company's Business Operations
, including personnel data relating to Company's employees, such as compensation arrangements; information with respect to Company's suppliers and the availability of all goods used in its business; and other financial information relating to Company's income, expenses, profits and general financial standing.
Information About Company's Finances and Operations
Employee understands that the confidential customer, business, financial and operational information which has been learned or will be learned about Company's business could be used to compete unfairly with Aaron's and could also be of great value to Company's competitors.
 
Employee acknowledges that as an employee of Aaron's, Employee will use confidential information supplied by Aaron's or developed as an employee of Aaron's to become a principal contact with customers of Aaron's. Employee understands that the relationship which has developed or will develop with such customers as a result of Company's investment in Employee and Employee's commitment of time while in the employ of Aaron's will involve elements of personal service and trust, and acknowledges that Employee will develop goodwill for Aaron's with such customers, all of which are the sole and exclusive property of Aaron's.
Employee's services as an employee of Aaron's and Employee's own individual career development depend to a significant degree on Employee's use of and access to Company's confidential information, because such information is critical to informed business decisions. If Aaron's management did not feel confident that such information would neither be disclosed to outsiders nor used in competition with the Company and if management were not certain that Employee's relationships with employees or customers would not be used to the detriment of the Company, Aaron's management would not readily share such information and promote its relationship with Employee, and Employee's job performance and career opportunities would thereby suffer. Aaron's and Employee understand and agree that the provisions listed below are necessary and reasonable for the protection of Company's goodwill, its confidential information and its financial investment in Employee, should Employee's employment with Aaron's be terminated, and are appropriate and necessary to permit and facilitate Employee's employment and career development.
In consideration of the foregoing and the following, which consideration is acknowledged to be sufficient, Employee and Aaron's desire to enter into and be bound by this Employee Agreement for their mutual benefit and to provide circumstances which will permit Aaron's and Employee to function as herein described.

ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
(d)           Exhibits:
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
ATLANTA, October 5, 2011  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced that it has reached an agreement to purchase 11.5% of Perfect Home Holdings Limited, a privately-held U.K. rent-to-own company.
 
Perfect Home Holdings Limited, which operates under the PerfectHome brand, was founded in 2006 and provides basic home furnishings in the U.K. to the non-standard credit market. Based near Birmingham, PerfectHome currently has 45 stores open throughout England and has plans to approximately double the number of stores over the next several years.
 
Aarons will pay ten million British pounds, or approximately US$15.4 million at current exchange rates, for its interest in PerfectHome and will have an option to increase its ownership in the future. The funds will be primarily used by PerfectHome to accelerate the growth of its store openings. The closing of the transaction requires regulatory approval which is currently being sought.  The transaction will be effective only following Aarons obtaining such approval. The investment will be recorded as an asset on Aarons balance sheet.
 
We are very excited about this investment in PerfectHome, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons. Not only will it provide PerfectHome growth capital, it will also enable Aarons to learn about the U.K. market for possible future expansion there and perhaps provide an eventual gateway into other European markets. Although we feel our growth prospects remain excellent in the U.S., we plan to further explore international opportunities that could complement domestic growth.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On October 24, 2011, Aarons, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the third quarter of 2011.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release presents the Companys net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 excluding a charge to operating expenses of $36.5 million recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to a lawsuit judgment against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, less the portion covered by insurance.  As lawsuit judgments and related expenses of this magnitude are unprecedented in the Companys history, and because the Company is in the process of appealing the judgment, management believes that presentation of this particular non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it allows investors to more easily evaluate and compare the performance of the Companys business from period to period.  Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

ATLANTA, October 24, 2011  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.
 
For the third quarter of 2011, revenues increased 7% to $485.2 million compared to $452.2 million for the same period of last year.  Net earnings were $28.0 million versus $26.2 million in 2010.  Diluted earnings per share were $.36 compared to $.32 per share a year ago, a 13% increase.
 
For the first nine months of this year, revenues increased 8% to $1.501 billion compared to $1.392 billion for the same period of 2010.  Net earnings were $83.2 million versus $87.6 million last year.  Diluted earnings per share in 2011 were $1.04 versus $1.07 in 2010.
 
Excluding a lawsuit related charge in the second quarter, net earnings for the nine months of 2011 would have been $105.8 million and diluted earnings per share excluding the lawsuit related charge would have been $1.32, a 23% increase over the nine months of last year.
 
We once again are seeing strong revenue gains with same store revenues up 5.3% and same store customer counts up 6.3% over the third quarter of last year, said Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons.  Even though these gains are outstanding considering the current economic conditions and the traditionally more difficult summer months in our business, there is no doubt that our customers are struggling as a result of high unemployment and overall economic pressures.  However, we believe we are successfully meeting these challenges and that business will remain good in the upcoming quarters.

Although diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were within our previously provided guidance, the results were at the lower end of expectations.  Margins were affected during the quarter by higher depreciation expense on lease merchandise, primarily as a result of an increase in lower margin early payouts of agreements, and the costs of rapidly increasing the number of HomeSmart stores.   The HomeSmart weekly pay concept, which continues to be in the experimental mode, is showing a lot of promise but we expect start-up costs to negatively affect earnings for the next several quarters.  We currently plan to have approximately 70 HomeSmart stores open by the end of this year and then not open a significant number of additional stores until we can more fully evaluate the financial performance of the HomeSmart concept, Mr. Loudermilk added.
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 5.3% during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010.  Same store revenues increased 3.8% for Company-operated stores open over two years at the end of September 2011.  The Company had 961,000 customers and its franchisees had 520,000 customers at the end of the third quarter of 2011, a 9.8% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the third quarter a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aarons, Inc.).  The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 6.3% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
 
During the first nine months of this year the Company generated over $296 million of cash flow from operations and had $218.9 million of cash on hand at the end of September 2011.
 
The Company repurchased 3,621,563 shares of Common Stock during the third quarter representing a total cash outlay of $89.7 million.  In the first nine months of 2011 the Company repurchased 5,076,675 shares at a cost of $127.2 million.  The Company has the authorization to purchase an additional 5,281,344 shares of its Common Stock.
 
As previously announced, during the third quarter the Company received $125 million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in a private placement. These funds will be used for general corporate purposes and for the repurchase of Company stock from time to time.

  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Company received regulatory approval for its previously announced ten million British pound investment in Perfect Home Holdings Limited, a U.K. rent-to-own company.
Division Results
 
The Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the third quarter of 2011 to $478.0 million, a 7% increase over the $448.4 million in revenues in the third quarter of 2010.  Sales and lease ownership revenues for the first nine months of 2011 increased 8% to $1.488 billion compared to $1.380 billion for the same period a year ago.
 
The revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture division, of which there is one remaining store liquidating merchandise, were $676,000 in the third quarter of 2011 and $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2010.  The Aarons Office Furniture division recorded a pre-tax profit of $15,000 in the third quarter of 2011 and a pre-tax loss of $993,000 in the third quarter of 2010.  For the first nine months of 2011, revenues of the Aarons Office Furniture division were $3.0 million compared to $10.0 million for the same period of 2010, and pre-tax profits were $492,000 in 2011 versus pre-tax losses of $11.1 million in 2010.
Components of Revenue
 
Consolidated lease revenues and fees for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 increased 9% and 8%, respectively, over the comparable previous year periods.  In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 9% for the third quarter and first nine months compared to the same periods in 2010.  Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 2% to $86.1 million for the third quarter from $84.3 million in the comparable period in 2010, and increased 7% to $271.2 million for the first nine months compared to $253.9 million for the first nine months of last year.  The increases in the Companys franchise revenues and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $223.9 million during the third quarter and $683.3 million during the first nine months of 2011, a 10% and 9% increase, respectively, over the prior year periods.  Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores increased 3.1% and 3.2%, respectively, for the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year.  Revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aarons, Inc.

The Companys other revenues in the third quarter of 2011 and 2010 included $1.7 million and $1.2 million of gains, respectively, from the sale of Company-operated stores.  Other revenues for the first nine months included gains from the sale of stores of $2.7 in 2011 and $1.6 million in 2010.
 
Store Count
 
During the third quarter of 2011, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened eight new Company-operated stores, 16 franchised stores, four HomeSmart stores, and one RIMCO store.  In two previously announced transactions during the quarter, 38 third party stores were acquired, with 37 of these stores being converted to new HomeSmart stores, and the Company sold the accounts of one of the acquired stores to an Aarons franchisee.  In addition, the accounts of 27 third party stores were also acquired.   Aaron's also sold 15 stores to a third party, purchased two stores from an Aaron's franchisees, and three Company-operated stores and two franchised stores were closed during the quarter.
 
Through the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the Company awarded area development agreements to open seven and 51 additional franchised stores, respectively.  At the end of September 2011, area development agreements were awarded to open 247 franchised over the next several years.
 
At September 30, 2011, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,135 Company-operated stores, 693 franchised stores, 56 HomeSmart stores, 13 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and six franchised RIMCO stores.  The Company also had one Aaron's Office Furniture store.  The total number of stores open at the end of September 2011 was 1,904.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Outlook
 
The Company is updating its guidance for 2011 and expects to achieve the following:

Aarons, Inc., based in Atlanta, currently has more than 1,904 Company-operated and franchised stores in 48 states and Canada.  The Companys Woodhaven Furniture Industries division manufactured approximately $79 million, at cost, of furniture and bedding in 2010 and currently has plants at 13 facilities in eight states.

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aarons, Inc.s business that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  These risks and uncertainties include factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation  and other issues, and the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and in any subsequent quarterly reports.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information:
The Company believes that non-GAAP performance measures, which management uses in evaluating the Company's business, may provide users of the Company's financial information with additional meaningful bases for comparing the Company's current results and results in a prior period, as these measures reflect factors that are unique to one period relative to the comparable period. However, the non-GAAP performance measures should be viewed in addition to, not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
As previously disclosed, the Company was subject to a jury verdict rendered in June 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois which awarded $93.5 million in damages to a former employee who alleged she was sexually harassed by her supervising manager.  Of the total damages awarded, $53.7 million exceeded the maximum award permitted under federal laws.  Subsequently the presiding judge in the trial reduced the damages to $39.8 million in accordance with the statute.  Consequently, in the second quarter, a charge to lawsuit expense of $36.5 million was recorded which represents the judgment and related legal expenses after insurance coverage. The Company strongly believes that the award does not accurately reflect the evidence in the case and is filing post-trial motions with the Court in an attempt to reverse the verdict, reduce the size of the verdict or otherwise be granted a new trial.

Except for any claims Employee may have for workers compensation benefits, unemployment compensation benefits, vested pension benefits (including vested benefits under the Employers nonqualified deferred compensation plan), or health care, disability, or other similar welfare benefits (which are not released by this Confidential Waiver and Release), Employee, for himself and on behalf of his heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to throughout the remainder of this Confidential Waiver and Release as ) knowingly and voluntarily releases and forever discharges Employer, its subsidiaries, affiliates, related entities, divisions, predecessors, successors and assigns, their benefits plans and programs and their current and former employees, attorneys, officers, directors and agents thereof (collectively referred to throughout the remainder of this Confidential Waiver and Release as Releasees), of and from any and all controversies, claims, demands, promises, actions, suits, grievances, proceedings, complaints, charges, liabilities, damages, debts, allowances, costs, expenses, attorneys fees, and remedies of any type that Employee may have by reason of any matter, cause, act, or omission that has occurred before the date on which Employee signs this Confidential Waiver and Release (individually and collectively, Claims), including, but not limited to, those Claims arising out of or in connection with Employees employment with or separation from employment with Employer.

Furthermore, Employee agrees that, except to the extent such right may not be waived by law, Employee will not commence any legal action or lawsuit or otherwise assert any legal claim seeking relief for any Claim released or waived under the Release of Claims provision above.  This agreement not to sue does not, however, prevent or prohibit Employee from seeking a judicial determination of the validity of Employees release of claims under the ADEA.  In addition, this covenant not to sue does not prevent or prohibit Employee from filing any administrative complaint or charge against the Releasees (or any of them) with any federal, state, or local agency, including, for instance, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the U.S. Department of Labor, but Employee understands that by signing this Confidential Waiver and Release, Employee will have no right to recover monetary damages or obtain individual relief of any kind in such proceeding with respect to Claims released or waived by this Confidential Waiver and Release.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On February 9, 2012, Aarons, Inc. issued a press release to announce its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
This press release presents the Companys net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding a charge of $36.5 million recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to a previously announced lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, less the portion covered by insurance, as well as a $3.5 million separation charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the previously announced departure of the Companys former Chief Executive Officer. These measures are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
 
Lawsuit verdicts and related expenses of the magnitude experienced during the second quarter of 2011 are unprecedented in the Companys history, and the Company is in the process of seeking to reduce or overturn the verdict. The Company strongly believes that the verdict does not accurately reflect the evidence in the case. In addition, the court ruled on January 13, 2012 not to sustain the verdict in its current form and the Company is waiting for a detailed ruling regarding whether the court will order a new trial or reduce the jurys damages award beyond its initial reduction to $39.8 million. The fourth quarter separation charge related primarily to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and stock options previously granted to Companys former Chief Executive Officer.
 
While these adjusted items may not be considered as non-recurring in nature in a strictly accounting sense, management regards those items as infrequent and not arising out of the ordinary course of business. Management believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding these charges is useful because it gives investors supplemental information to evaluate and compare the performance of the Companys underlying core business from period to period. The lawsuit and separation adjustments involve matters that are not entirely susceptible to prediction or effective management, and consequently the Company believes presenting earnings measures excluding the effects of those matters can provide investors with additional data to assess the Companys performance. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Companys GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Aarons, Inc.
Announces Fourth Quarter and Year End Results
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATLANTA, February 9, 2012  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, revenues increased 8% to $523.5 million compared to $484.4 million for the fourth quarter in 2010. Net earnings decreased 1% to $30.5 million versus $30.8 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.40 compared to $.38 a year ago, a 5% increase.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, revenues increased 8% to $2.024 billion compared to $1.877 billion for 2010. Net earnings decreased 4% to $113.8 million versus $118.4 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were down 1% to $1.43 for 2011 compared to $1.44 in 2010.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2011 the Company recorded a $3.5 million, or $.03 per diluted share, charge to earnings for separation costs primarily related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and stock options previously granted to its former Chief Executive Officer. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and 2011 year excluding this charge would have been $.43 and $1.46, respectively. Additionally, as previously reported, the Company recorded a lawsuit-related charge in the second quarter of 2011 of $36.5 million. On January 13, 2012, the court ruled not to sustain the verdict previously reported, although it did not indicate what action it would take, including whether it would order a new trial or reduce the jurys damages award.  We are awaiting additional developments in the lawsuit, which could affect the litigation expense accrual. Excluding the fourth quarter separation-related charge and the second quarter lawsuit-related charge, net earnings for 2011 would have been $138.6 million, up 17% over the same period in 2010, and diluted earnings per share excluding the two charges would have been $1.75, a 22% increase over the same period in 2010.
 
Excluding the aforementioned $.03 diluted per share charge, our results for the fourth quarter and year were within our guidance, said Ronald W. Allen, interim President and Chief Executive Officer of Aarons. We had good revenue and customer growth during the quarter, and believe the results were outstanding in these challenging economic times. Our market remains large, and the high-quality, affordable basic home furnishings we provide fulfills the desires and needs of our customers.
 
We continued to expand our HomeSmart weekly rental business during the quarter and had 71 HomeSmart stores open at the end of the year. Revenues of the HomeSmart stores grew to $8.6 million for the fourth quarter and $15.4 million for the year; however, the start-up expenses associated with opening these stores negatively affected earnings during the quarter by $.03 per diluted share and $.06 per diluted share for the year. We continue to be very optimistic about the future prospects for HomeSmart, but as previously stated, do not plan to open a significant number of additional HomeSmart stores until the earnings and return on investment potential of this concept are thoroughly evaluated, Mr. Allen added.
 
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 3.7% during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Same store revenues also increased 2.1% for Company-operated stores open for over two years at the end of 2011.

Consolidated lease revenues and fees increased 8% for both the fourth quarter and the year 2011 compared to the same prior year periods. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 2% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year compared to the same periods last year. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aarons Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 9% for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year and 7% for the year. The increases in the Companys franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Companys franchisees, who collectively had revenues of $225.6 million during the fourth quarter and $908.9 million for the year, 5% and 8% increases over the comparable respective 2010 periods. For the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same quarter a year ago, same store revenue growth for franchised stores was basically flat, being down 0.1%; however, same store customer counts were up 4.6%.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aaron's, Inc.'s business that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues, and the risks and uncertainties discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. Statements in this release that are forward-looking include without limitation Aarons projected revenues, earnings and store openings for future periods.

(Unaudited and Preliminary)
 
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information:
 
This press release presents the Companys net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding a charge of $36.5 million recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to a previously announced lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, less the portion covered by insurance, as well as a $3.5 million separation charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the previously announced departure of the Companys former Chief Executive Officer. These measures are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
 
Lawsuit verdicts and related expenses of the magnitude experienced during the second quarter of 2011 are unprecedented in the Companys history, and the Company is in the process of seeking to reduce or overturn the verdict. The Company strongly believes that the verdict does not accurately reflect the evidence in the case. In addition, the court ruled on January 13, 2012 not to sustain the verdict in its current form and the Company is waiting for a detailed ruling regarding whether the court will order a new trial or reduce the jurys damages award beyond its initial reduction to $39.8 million. The fourth quarter separation charge related primarily to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and stock options previously granted to Companys former Chief Executive Officer.
 
While these adjusted items may not be considered as non-recurring in nature in a strictly accounting sense, management regards those items as infrequent and not arising out of the ordinary course of business. Management believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding these charges is useful because it gives investors supplemental information to evaluate and compare the performance of the Companys underlying core business from period to period. The lawsuit and separation adjustments involve matters that are not entirely susceptible to prediction or effective management, and consequently the Company believes presenting earnings measures excluding the effects of those matters can provide investors with additional data to assess the Companys performance. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Companys GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.
 
 
Reconciliation of Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share Assuming Dilution to Non-GAAP Net Earnings Excluding Separation-Related Charge, Non-GAAP Net Earnings Excluding Lawsuit-Related Charge, Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share Assuming Dilution Excluding Separation-Related Charge and Separation-Related Charge and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share Assuming Dilution Excluding Lawsuit-Related Charge and Separation-Related Charge
(In thousands, except earnings per share)

Aarons, Inc. Settles Lawsuit
 
 
ATLANTA, March 26, 2012  Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nations leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced that the Company has entered into a settlement of a lawsuit with a former Aarons associate who claimed she was sexually harassed by a former co-worker in 2006.
 
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, resulted in a verdict which originally consisted of approximately $95 million in damages awarded to the plaintiff. Of the total damages awarded, $50 million exceeded the maximum award permitted by law. Consequently, the Court reduced the judgment against Aarons to $39.8 million in 2011. In a separate legal proceeding, a criminal jury acquitted the former co-worker of all charges on September 28, 2011.
 
On January 13, 2012, the Court held a hearing on the Companys post-trial motions. During the hearing, the Court stated that the jurys verdict of $95 million was monstrously excessive and found that the jury, as to damages in this case either failed to understand the Courts instructions, intentionally disregarded them or returned a verdict that was the product of passion or prejudice. Following the hearing, the Court ruled not to sustain the verdict in its current form. The parties agreed to settle the lawsuit prior to receiving the Courts further ruling on Aarons request for additional relief as set forth in its post-trial motions. As a result of the settlement, the parties filed with the Court a stipulation to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice.
 
 
The Company agrees with the Court that the verdict was monstrously excessive. Ronald W. Allen, Aarons President and Chief Executive Officer said that Aarons has a robust non-harassment policy and accompanying practices designed to protect our associates, and we are pleased to get this litigation behind us.
 
The Company recorded a charge of $36.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, which represented an accrual for the judgment and associated legal fees and expenses of $41.5 million, less insurance coverage of $5.0 million. With this final settlement in the amount of $6.0 million, the Company plans to take into income $35.5 million of the accrued amount in the first quarter of 2012.
 
Aarons, Inc., based in Atlanta, currently has more than 1,950 Company-operated and franchised stores in 48 states and Canada. The Company also manufactures furniture and bedding at 14 facilities in eight states.
 
"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aaron's, Inc.'s business that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues, and the risks and uncertainties discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.

On April 18, 2012, Aaron's, Inc. (the "") entered into employment agreements with each of Ronald W. Allen, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Gilbert L. Danielson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective as of April 18, 2012. Each agreement has a rolling, two year term that is automatically extended each day for an additional day, such that the remaining term continues to be two years; provided, however, that the Company may, upon notice to the respective executive, cease such automatic extension of the agreement term.
Company
The agreements provide for an annual base salary of $850,000 for Mr. Allen and $650,000 for Mr. Danielson, and for participation in any of the Company's present and future bonus plans that are generally available to the Company's executive officers. Under the agreements, Mr. Allen and Mr. Danielson are also entitled to paid vacation, life insurance, health insurance, fringe benefits and such other employee benefits generally made available by the Company to its executive officers.
Each of the agreements specifies the payments to be provided if the employment of Mr. Allen or Mr. Danielson, as applicable, is terminated under various scenarios described in the agreements, including death, disability, termination with or without cause, and termination with or without good reason. Under the agreements, upon an involuntary termination without cause (or a termination by the executive for good reason following a change in control of the Company), each executive is entitled to continued salary and bonus payments for a severance period of twenty-four months; a cash payment in an amount sufficient after taxes to equal the cost of COBRA continuation premiums for health and dental benefits for a twenty-four month severance period; and full vesting of all outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other equity awards that have been granted to the executive. Termination for cause or a voluntary termination (other than for good reason following a change in control of the Company) would not entitle the executives to these benefits, and the executives would only be entitled to the payment of certain already accrued and vested amounts. If any payments to be made or benefits to be provided under the agreements would result a "parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments or benefits will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary so that no such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes a parachute payment, unless the net after-tax amount the executive would receive without this reduction exceeds by at least ten percent the net after-tax amount the executive would receive with this reduction.
Under the agreements, Mr. Allen and Mr. Danielson have also agreed to customary confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and release provisions.
The foregoing descriptions of the agreements are summaries only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as and and incorporated by reference herein.

Non-Solicitation of Customers
(e) During employment and for a period of two years following the Termination Date, Executive will not solicit or attempt to solicit, directly or by assisting others, any employee, franchisee, or independent contractor to terminate his or her employment or other relationship with the Company.

9. .
Section 409A
(a) Solely as necessary to comply with Section 409A, for purposes of Section 6, "termination of employment" or "employment termination" or similar terms shall have the same meaning as "separation from service" under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code, and no payments shall be made under Section 6(c) unless a separation from service has occurred.
.
Meaning of Termination of Employment
(b) For purposes of Section 6(c) with respect to amounts payable in the event of termination of Executive's employment by the Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason, each such payment is a separate payment within the meaning of the final regulations under Section 409A.
.
Installment Payments
(c) This Agreement will be construed and administered to preserve the exemption from Section 409A of payments that qualify as a short-term deferral or that qualify for the two-times separation pay exception. With respect to other amounts that are subject to Section 409A, it is intended, and this Agreement will be so construed, that any such amounts payable under this Agreement and the Company's and Executive's exercise of authority or discretion hereunder shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the treasury regulations relating thereto so as not to subject Executive to the payment of interest and additional tax that may be imposed under Section 409A. As a result, in the event Executive is a "specified employee" on the date of Executive's termination of employment (with such status determined by the Company in accordance with rules established by the Company in writing in advance of the "specified employee identification date" that relates to the date of Executive's termination of employment, or in the absence of such rules established by the Company, under the default rules for identifying specified employees under Section 409A), any payment that is subject to Section 409A and that is payable to Executive in connection with Executive's separation from service shall not be paid until the first business day following the expiration of six months after Executive's Termination Date (if Executive dies after Executive's Termination Date but before any payment has been made, such remaining payments that were or could have been delayed will be paid to Executive's estate without regard to such six-month delay).

Six-Month Delay
10. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit to be paid or provided hereunder would be a "Parachute Payment," within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided hereunder shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes a Parachute Payment; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction shall not be made if the total of the unreduced aggregate payments and benefits to be provided to Executive, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes), exceeds by at least ten percent (10%) the total after-tax amount of such aggregate payments and benefits after application of the foregoing reduction. The determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided hereunder is required pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made at the expense of the Company, if requested by Executive or the Company, by the Company's independent accountants. The fact that Executive's right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section shall not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of Executive under this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section and no such payment or benefit qualifies as a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A ("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation"), Executive shall be entitled to designate the payments and/or benefits to be so reduced in order to give effect to this Section. The Company shall provide Executive with all information reasonably requested by Executive to permit Executive to make such designation. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section and any such payment or benefit constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation or Executive fails to elect an order in which payments or benefits will be reduced pursuant to this Section, then the reduction shall occur in the following order: (a) reduction of cash payments described in Sections 6(c)(i) and 6(c)(ii) (with such reduction being applied to the payments in the reverse order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier payments); (b) cancellation of acceleration of vesting on any equity awards for which the exercise price exceeds the then fair market value of the underlying equity; and (c) cancellation of acceleration of vesting of equity awards not covered under (c) above. Within any category of payments and benefits (that is, (a), (b) or (c)), a reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that are not Nonqualified Deferred Compensation within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and then with respect to amounts that are. In the event that acceleration of vesting of equity awards is to be cancelled, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of such equity awards, that is, later equity awards shall be canceled before earlier equity awards.

11. . Any incentive based compensation, or any other compensation, paid or payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement or arrangement with the Company, which is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation, order or stock exchange listing requirement, will be subject to such deductions and clawback (recovery) as may be required to be made pursuant to law, government regulation, order, stock exchange listing requirement (or any policy of the Company adopted pursuant to any such law, government regulation, order or stock exchange listing requirement). Executive specifically authorizes the Company to withhold from future wages any amounts that may become due under this provision; provided, however, nothing in this provision is intended to permit a change in the terms of payment of any deferred compensation subject to Section 409A in any manner that would violate or create a plan failure under Section 409A. This Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.
Clawback
 
(a) . Any controversy, dispute or claim between the parties, including any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, relating to or concerning this Agreement, the breach of this Agreement, the employment of Executive, or the termination of Executive's employment (a "") will be resolved pursuant to this Section 12.

Injunctive Relief
 
9. .
Section 409A
(a) Solely as necessary to comply with Section 409A, for purposes of Section 6, "termination of employment" or "employment termination" or similar terms shall have the same meaning as "separation from service" under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code, and no payments shall be made under Section 6(c) unless a separation from service has occurred.
.
Meaning of Termination of Employment
(b) For purposes of Section 6(c) with respect to amounts payable in the event of termination of Executive's employment by the Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason, each such payment is a separate payment within the meaning of the final regulations under Section 409A.
.
Installment Payments
(c) This Agreement will be construed and administered to preserve the exemption from Section 409A of payments that qualify as a short-term deferral or that qualify for the two-times separation pay exception. With respect to other amounts that are subject to Section 409A, it is intended, and this Agreement will be so construed, that any such amounts payable under this Agreement and the Company's and Executive's exercise of authority or discretion hereunder shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the treasury regulations relating thereto so as not to subject Executive to the payment of interest and additional tax that may be imposed under Section 409A. As a result, in the event Executive is a "specified employee" on the date of Executive's termination of employment (with such status determined by the Company in accordance with rules established by the Company in writing in advance of the "specified employee identification date" that relates to the date of Executive's termination of employment, or in the absence of such rules established by the Company, under the default rules for identifying specified employees under Section 409A), any payment that is subject to Section 409A and that is payable to Executive in connection with Executive's separation from service shall not be paid until the first business day following the expiration of six months after Executive's Termination Date (if Executive dies after Executive's Termination Date but before any payment has been made, such remaining payments that were or could have been delayed will be paid to Executive's estate without regard to such six-month delay).

Six-Month Delay
 
10. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit to be paid or provided hereunder would be a "Parachute Payment," within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided hereunder shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes a Parachute Payment; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction shall not be made if the total of the unreduced aggregate payments and benefits to be provided to Executive, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes), exceeds by at least ten percent (10%) the total after-tax amount of such aggregate payments and benefits after application of the foregoing reduction. The determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided hereunder is required pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made at the expense of the Company, if requested by Executive or the Company, by the Company's independent accountants. The fact that Executive's right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section shall not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of Executive under this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section and no such payment or benefit qualifies as a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A ("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation"), Executive shall be entitled to designate the payments and/or benefits to be so reduced in order to give effect to this Section. The Company shall provide Executive with all information reasonably requested by Executive to permit Executive to make such designation. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section and any such payment or benefit constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation or Executive fails to elect an order in which payments or benefits will be reduced pursuant to this Section, then the reduction shall occur in the following order: (a) reduction of cash payments described in Sections 6(c)(i) and 6(c)(ii) (with such reduction being applied to the payments in the reverse order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier payments); (b) cancellation of acceleration of vesting on any equity awards for which the exercise price exceeds the then fair market value of the underlying equity; and (c) cancellation of acceleration of vesting of equity awards not covered under (c) above. Within any category of payments and benefits (that is, (a), (b) or (c)), a reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that are not Nonqualified Deferred Compensation within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and then with respect to amounts that are. In the event that acceleration of vesting of equity awards is to be cancelled, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of such equity awards, that is, later equity awards shall be canceled before earlier equity awards.
.
Section 280G Parachute Payments
11. . Any incentive based compensation, or any other compensation, paid or payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement or arrangement with the Company, which is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation, order or stock exchange listing requirement, will be subject to such deductions and clawback (recovery) as may be required to be made pursuant to law, government regulation, order, stock exchange listing requirement (or any policy of the Company adopted pursuant to any such law, government regulation, order or stock exchange listing requirement). Executive specifically authorizes the Company to withhold from future wages any amounts that may become due under this provision; provided, however, nothing in this provision is intended to permit a change in the terms of payment of any deferred compensation subject to Section 409A in any manner that would violate or create a plan failure under Section 409A. This Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.
Clawback

Any controversy, dispute or claim between the parties, including any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, relating to or concerning this Agreement, the breach of this Agreement, the employment of Executive, or the termination of Executive's employment (a "") will be resolved pursuant to this Section 12.

This press release presents the Company's net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the reversal of a $35.5 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2012 related to a previously announced lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses. This measure is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").
While the lawsuit may not be considered as non-recurring in nature in a strictly accounting sense, management regards the circumstances of this particular lawsuit as infrequent and not arising out of the ordinary course of business. The lawsuit adjustment involves matters that are not entirely susceptible to prediction or effective management, and consequently management believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the reversal of this accrual is useful because it gives investors supplemental information to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's underlying core business from period to period. In addition, in prior periods, the Company presented net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the charge; consequently, the Company believes that presenting those same financial measures excluding the reversal of the charge in the most recent period provides a more balanced overall presentation. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

For the first quarter of 2012, revenues increased 10% to $586.9 million compared to $532.7 million for the first quarter in 2011. Net earnings increased 60% to $71.2 million versus $44.4 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.92 compared to $.55 per share a year ago, a 67% increase.
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company settled a lawsuit with a former Aaron's associate who claimed she was sexually harassed by a former co-worker in 2006. The Company recorded a charge of $36.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, which represented an accrual for the judgment and associated legal fees and expenses of $41.5 million, less insurance coverage of $5.0 million. The Company's final settlement related to this matter was $6 million, and accordingly, the Company recognized $35.5 million of income in the first quarter of 2012 operating results.
Excluding the lawsuit-related accrual reversal, net earnings for the first quarter would have been $49.2 million, up 11% over the same period in 2011, and diluted earnings per share would have been $.64, a 16% increase over the same period in 2011.
"We are quite pleased with the results for the quarter and feel we have an excellent start for the year," said Ronald W. Allen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron's. "Our results exceeded expectations, revenue and customer growth is strong, and the HomeSmart stores are ramping up as anticipated. We are optimistic that customer demand for the basic household furnishings we offer, especially with our flexible payment terms, will continue to be quite good in upcoming months."
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 4.8% during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. Same store revenues also increased 2.6% for Company-operated stores open for over two years at the end of March 2012. The Company had 1,043,000 customers at the end of the most recent quarter, a 14% increase over the number at the end of March 2011. The customer count on a same store basis for Company-operated stores was up 8.6% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year.
During the first quarter of this year the Company generated over $90 million of cash flow from operations, which includes the reversal of the accrued lawsuit expense, and had $234 million of cash on hand at the end of March 2012.
Division Results
Revenues in the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased in the first quarter to $571.0 million, an 8% increase over the $529.9 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2011.
Revenues of the HomeSmart division increased in the first quarter to $12.5 million, a $12.2 million increase over the $330,000 in revenues in the first quarter of 2011.
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees increased 9% for the first quarter compared to the same period in the previous year. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 7% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 15% for the quarter compared to the first quarter last year. The increases in the Company's franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, which collectively had revenues of $264.4 million during the first quarter, a 10% increase over the comparable 2011 period. Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores were up 6.3% and 8.3%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our franchised stores had 564,000 customers at March 31, 2012, a 13% increase over the number at the end of the first quarter of 2011. Revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aaron's, Inc.
Store Count
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company opened nine Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, six franchised stores, and two HomeSmart stores. The Company also acquired three franchised stores and the accounts of nine third party stores. In addition, one store was acquired from a third party operator and converted to a HomeSmart store. Three Company-operated stores were closed during the quarter.
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 11 additional franchised stores. At the end of March 2012, area development agreements were outstanding for the opening of 223 franchised stores over the next several years.
At March 31, 2012, the Company had 1,153 Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 710 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores, 74 HomeSmart stores, 16 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and six franchised RIMCO stores. The Company also had one Aaron's Office Furniture store. The total number of stores open at the end of March 2012 was 1,960.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aaron's, Inc.'s business that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, litigation, customer privacy, information security, customer demand and other issues, and the other risks and uncertainties discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information:
This press release presents the Company's net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the reversal of a $35.5 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2012 related to a previously announced lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses. This measure is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").
Management believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the reversal of this accrual is useful because it gives investors supplemental information regarding the normal ongoing operations of the Company. This information is disclosed to provide the reader with the data management uses with the belief it will assist investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's underlying core business from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On July 24, 2012, Aarons, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release to announce its financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The press release presents the Companys net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding a $36.5 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to a previously announced lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, and the subsequent reversal into income of $35.5 million of such charge in the first quarter of 2012 related to the settlement of that lawsuit. These measures are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
 
While the lawsuit may not be considered as non-recurring in nature in a strictly accounting sense, management regards the circumstances of this particular lawsuit as infrequent and not arising out of the ordinary course of business. The lawsuit adjustments involve matters that are not entirely susceptible to prediction or effective management, and consequently management believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the recording and subsequent reversal of this accrual is useful because it gives investors supplemental information to evaluate and compare the performance of the Companys underlying core business from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Companys GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

Aaron's, Inc. Reports Record Second Quarter Results
-- Revenues Up 12% to $539.5 Million
-- Same Store Revenues Increase 6.1%
-- GAAP Diluted EPS $.47; Up 15% Excluding Prior Year Lawsuit Charge
ATLANTA, July 24, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Aaron's, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), the nation's leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012.
For the second quarter of 2012, revenues increased 12% to $539.5 million compared to $482.7 million for the second quarter in 2011. Net earnings were $36.2 million versus $10.8 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.47 compared to $.13 per share a year ago.
For the first six months of this year, revenues increased 11% to $1.126 billion compared to $1.015 billion for the first six months of 2011. Net earnings were $107.5 million versus $55.2 million last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first half were $1.40 for 2012 compared to $.68 in 2011.
As previously reported, the Company recorded a charge of $36.5 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to a lawsuit with a former Aaron's associate. In the first quarter of 2012 the Company settled this lawsuit and reversed into income $35.5 million of this charge.
Excluding from all periods the 2011 lawsuit-related charge and subsequent 2012 reversal, net earnings for the second quarter of 2012 would have been $36.2 million compared to $33.3 million for the same period in 2011, and earnings per share assuming dilution would have been $.47 compared to $.41 a year ago, a 15% increase. Net earnings for the six months of 2012 would have been $85.5 million compared to $77.7 million last year, and earnings per share assuming dilution would have been $1.11 versus $.96 last year, a 16% increase.
"Once again we are announcing outstanding financial results, which were in line with our expectations," said Ronald W. Allen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron's. "We continue to grow in revenues, earnings, customers, and store count. Regardless of the current economic times, customer demand remains strong in both our Company-operated and franchised stores. Our unique business model provides high-quality, basic household furnishings that are desired by our customers, and our superior service and flexible payment terms enable them to obtain these needed products. We are optimistic that business will continue to be strong for the rest of the year."
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both periods) increased 6.1% during the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011, and customer count on a same store basis was up 8.8%. Same store revenues increased 4.3% for Company-operated stores open over two years at the end of June 2012. The Company had 1,083,000 customers and its franchisees had 568,000 customers at the end of the second quarter of 2012, a 14.2% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the second quarter a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aaron's, Inc.).
During the first six months of this year the Company generated over $46 million of cash flow from operations and had $110 million of cash on hand at the end of June 2012. The Company reacquired 363,781 shares of Common Stock in the second quarter of 2012 and has authorization to purchase an additional 4,917,563 shares.
Division Results
The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the second quarter of 2012 to $523.7 million, a 9% increase over the $479.9 million in revenues in the second quarter of 2011. Sales and lease ownership revenues for the first half of 2012 increased 8% to $1.095 billion compared to $1.010 billion for the same period a year ago.
Revenues of the HomeSmart division increased in the second quarter to $13.7 million, compared to $657,000 in revenues in the second quarter of 2011. HomeSmart revenues for the first six months of 2012 were $26.2 million versus $987,000 for the same period a year ago.
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees for the second quarter and first half of 2012 increased 12% and 10%, respectively, over the comparable previous year periods. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 6% for the second quarter and 7% year to date compared to the same periods in 2011. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 14% to $96.4 million for the second quarter from $84.6 million in the comparable period in 2011, and increased 15% to $211.9 million for the first six months compared to $185.1 million for the first six months of last year. The increases in the Company's franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who, collectively, had revenues of $237.6 million during the second quarter and $502.0 million during the first six months of 2012, both a 9% increase over the prior year periods. Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores increased 7.0% and 10.1%, respectively, for the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aaron's, Inc.
Store Count
During the second quarter of 2012, the Company opened 13 Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, ten franchised stores, four HomeSmart stores, one franchised HomeSmart store and one RIMCO store. The Company also acquired 12 franchised stores and the accounts of three third party stores which were added to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores. In addition, the accounts of a third party store were also acquired and transferred to a HomeSmart store. Two Company-operated stores and two franchised stores were closed during the quarter.
Through the three months and six months ended June 30, 2012, the Company awarded area development agreements to open 18 and 29 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of June 2012, there were area development agreements outstanding for the opening of 222 franchised stores over the next several years.
At June 30, 2012, the Company had 1,176 Company-operated Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership stores, 706 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores, 78 HomeSmart stores, one franchised HomeSmart store, 17 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and six franchised RIMCO stores. The Company also had one Aaron's Office Furniture store. The total number of stores open at the end of June 2012 was 1,985.
Third Quarter and Full Year 2012 Outlook
The Company is updating its guidance for 2012, which remains substantially unchanged from previous guidance for the full year:
Third quarter revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of approximately $530 million.
Third quarter diluted earnings per share in the range of $.40 to $.44 per share.
Fiscal year 2012 revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of over $2.2 billion.
GAAP fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.35.
Non-GAAP fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.98 to $2.06, which excludes the first quarter reversal of the accrued lawsuit expense.
EPS guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2012 does not assume any significant repurchases of the Company's Common Stock.
New store growth of approximately 5% to 7% over the store base at the end of 2011, for the most part an equal mix between Company-operated and franchised stores, and including a small number of HomeSmart stores.  This will be a net store growth after any opportunistic merging or disposition of stores.
The Company will continue, as warranted, to consolidate or sell stores not meeting performance goals.
The Company also plans to continue to acquire franchised stores, convert independent operator's stores to Aaron's franchised stores, or sell Company-operated stores as opportunities present themselves.
Conference Call
Aaron's will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Tuesday, July 24, 2012, at 5:00 pm Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronsinc.com, in the "Investor Relations" section.

CHARLIE LOUDERMILK RETIRES
57 YEARS AFTER FOUNDING AARONS
 
 Aarons, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), a lease-to-own retailer specializing in the sales and lease ownership of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, announced today Chairman of the Board of Directors, R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., will retire mid-September after founding and building Aarons, now in its 57 year of operation. Upon his retirement, Loudermilk will become Chairman Emeritus of the Company.
ATLANTA (August 27, 2012)
th
 
I started Aarons in 1955 renting chairs for 10 cents a piece, Loudermilk said. I never dreamed that Aarons would grow into a publicly traded company employing more than 11,000 people and serving millions of Americans. I have given my heart and soul to this Company over the past 57 years, and Im truly proud of everything it has become. Though it was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made, the time has come for me to leave the Company and focus on personal endeavors that bring me joy. I am deeply indebted to the entire Aarons family for their ongoing love and support. Im thrilled to be retiring with the confidence that Aarons will carry on its legacy of community, quality and superior service.
 
Ray M. Robinson, lead director of Aarons Board of Directors, said, Few can enter retirement with Charlie Loudermilks history of excellence. He has achieved tremendous business success, served his community as a great civic leader and above all, he has been a loving father and grandfather. He leaves incredibly large shoes to fill, but we want Charlie to know that the Aarons leadership team will continue to grow and build the Company that Charlie committed himself to throughout the years.
 
Charlies impact can genuinely be felt coast to coast, said Ronald W. Allen, CEO and President. Not only has he built a Company that offers exceptional service to more than 1.5 million customers at nearly 2,000 stores across North America, but he has provided jobs to thousands of people and aided thousands more through his many philanthropic efforts. He is truly one of the nations great success stories while never forgetting his roots. Now at 85, he can devote his full energies on what he loves most  spending time with family. We are profoundly grateful for everything he has done for his community and Aarons, and we wish him the very best in retirement.
 
Loudermilk and a partner founded Aaron Rents in 1955 after borrowing $500 to purchase folding chairs and renting them for 10 cents a day to auction houses. The Company was renamed Aarons, Inc. in 2009. Though Aarons started in Atlanta, it now has more than 1,985 Company-operated and franchised stores in the U.S. and Canada.
 
In 2011, Loudermilk was presented with the prestigious Four Pillar Tribute award by the Council for Quality Growth. The Atlanta City Council voted to change the name of Buckhead Triangle Park to Charlie Loudermilk Park in 2009 in honor of his contributions to economic development in Buckhead. In 2008, Loudermilk was awarded the Association of Progressive Rental Organizations 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award and was named the Business to Business 2008 Philanthropist of the Year.

ITEM 2.02.      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On October 25, 2012, Aarons, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release to announce its financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The press release presents the Companys net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding a $36.5 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to a previously announced lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, and the subsequent reversal into income of $35.5 million of such charge in the first quarter of 2012 related to the settlement of that lawsuit. The press release also presents net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding a $10.4 million charge to earnings in the third quarter of 2012 for costs related to the previously announced retirement of the Companys founder and executive chairman. These measures are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
 
While the lawsuit may not be considered as non-recurring in nature in a strictly accounting sense, management regards the circumstances of this particular lawsuit as infrequent and not arising out of the ordinary course of business. The lawsuit adjustments involve matters that are not entirely susceptible to prediction or effective management.
 
Similarly, while separation or retirement charges do arise, management regards the size of this particular retirement-related charge for the Companys founder and executive chairmanwho had served with the Company for 57 years, including as its chief executive officer from its establishment in 1955 until 2008as uncommon.
 
Management consequently believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the recording and subsequent reversal of the lawsuit accrual and the retirement-related charge is useful because it gives investors supplemental information to evaluate and compare the performance of the Companys underlying core business from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Companys GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

Aaron's, Inc. Reports Record Third Quarter Results
-- Revenues Up 9% to $529.5 Million
-- Same Store Revenues Increase 6.5%
-- GAAP Diluted EPS $.38; Up 6%
-- GAAP Diluted EPS Includes $.08 Retirement-Related Charge
-- Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $.46: Up 28%
ATLANTA, Oct. 25, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Aaron's, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), a leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced record revenues and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012.
For the third quarter of 2012, revenues increased 9% to $529.5 million compared to $484.7 million for the third quarter in 2011. Net earnings were $28.9 million versus $28.0 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.38 compared to $.36 per share in 2011.
For the first nine months of this year, revenues advanced 10% to $1.654 billion compared to $1.500 billion for the first nine months of 2011. Net earnings were $136.4 million versus $83.2 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months were $1.77 for 2012 compared to $1.04 in 2011.
During the third quarter of 2012 the Company recorded a $10.4 million, or $.08 per diluted share, charge to earnings for costs associated with the retirement of the Company's founder and Chairman of the Board. Additionally, as previously reported, the Company recorded a charge of $36.5 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to a lawsuit with a former Aaron's associate. In the first quarter of 2012 the Company settled this lawsuit and reversed into income $35.5 million of this charge.
Excluding from all periods the third quarter retirement-related charge and the 2011 lawsuit-related charge and subsequent 2012 reversal, net earnings for the third quarter of 2012 would have been $35.4 million compared to $28.0 million for the same period in 2011, and earnings per share assuming dilution would have been $.46 compared to $.36 a year ago, a 28% increase. Net earnings for the nine months of 2012 would have been $120.8 million compared to $105.8 million a year ago, up 14% over the same period in 2011, and earnings per share assuming dilution would have been $1.57 versus $1.32 last year, a 19% increase.
"We are pleased with our third quarter results of operations. Excluding the charge related to the retirement of our founder, earnings exceeded expectations. Revenue growth remains very strong and our planned new store openings are on schedule," said Ronald W. Allen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron's. "Demand for the high-quality, basic home furnishings we offer, with superior service and flexible payment terms, continues in these difficult economic times, and we expect 2012 will be another record year for the Company in both revenues and earnings."
"Our HomeSmart stores are ramping up in revenues as anticipated and we remain quite optimistic that this weekly pay concept will substantially contribute to our future growth. However, we still have some work to do in perfecting the store business model, and do not currently plan to open a significant number of additional HomeSmart stores until after the first half of next year," Mr. Allen continued. "We feel we still have substantial opportunity for adding additional Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, and expect our overall new store growth in 2013 to be comparable to the number of stores added in 2012."
"Finally, I join the management team and all Aaron's associates, both past and present, in wishing our founder Charlie Loudermilk a very long and well deserved retirement. The vision, leadership, knowledge and other contributions Charlie gave to Aaron's over 57 years, as well as the impact he has had in the business and civic community, are too many to mention. He certainly will be missed," Mr. Allen concluded.
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both quarters) increased 6.5% during the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011, and customer count on a same store basis was up 8.2%. For Company-operated stores open over two years at the end of September 2012, same store revenues increased 4.8% during the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. The Company had 1,090,000 customers and its franchisees had 572,000 customers at the end of the third quarter of 2012, a 12.2% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the third quarter a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aaron's, Inc.).
During the first nine months of this year the Company generated over $86 million of cash flow from operations and had $156 million of cash on hand at the end of September 2012. The Company reacquired 872,908 shares of Common Stock in the third quarter of 2012 and 1,236,689 shares during the first nine months of the year, and has authorization to purchase an additional 4,044,655 shares.
Division Results
The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the third quarter of 2012 to $513.6 million, a 7% increase over the $478.0 million in revenues in the third quarter of 2011. Sales and lease ownership revenues for the first nine months of 2012 increased 8% to $1.608 billion compared to $1.488 billion for the same period a year ago.
Revenues of the HomeSmart division increased in the third quarter to $14.2 million, compared to $5.7 million in revenues in the third quarter of 2011. HomeSmart revenues for the first nine months of 2012 were $40.4 million versus $6.7 million for the same period a year ago.
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 increased 12% and 11%, respectively, over the comparable previous year periods. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 1% for the third quarter and 5% year to date compared to the same periods in 2011. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 1% to $87.2 million for the third quarter from $86.1 million in the comparable period in 2011, and increased 10% to $299.2 million for the first nine months compared to $271.2 million for the first nine months of last year. The increases in the Company's franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who, collectively, had revenues of $231.6 million during the third quarter and $733.6 million during the first nine months of 2012, a 3% and 7% increase, respectively, over the prior year periods. Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores increased 3.2% and 9.9%, respectively, for the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aaron's, Inc.
Store Count
During the third quarter of 2012, the Company opened 14 Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores and 13 franchised stores. The Company also acquired four franchised stores and the accounts of three third party stores which were added to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores. In addition, the accounts of two third party stores were acquired and transferred to a HomeSmart store. The Company also sold two Company-operated stores to franchisees and the one remaining Aaron's Office Furniture store was sold to a third party. Two Company-operated stores were closed during the quarter.
Through the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the Company awarded area development agreements to open seven and 36 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of September 2012, there were area development agreements outstanding for the opening of 201 franchised stores over the next several years.
At September 30, 2012, the Company had 1,190 Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 717 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores, 78 HomeSmart stores, one franchised HomeSmart store, 17 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and six franchised RIMCO stores. The total number of stores open at the end of September 2012 was 2,009.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Outlook
The Company is updating its guidance for 2012 and expects to achieve the following:
Fourth quarter revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of approximately $575 million.
Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share in the range of $.48 to $.52 per share.
Fiscal year 2012 revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of over $2.2 billion.
GAAP fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.25 to $2.29.
Non-GAAP fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.05 to $2.09, which excludes the first quarter reversal of the accrued lawsuit expense and the third quarter retirement charge.  
Our initial earnings guidance for fiscal year 2013 is to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.25 to $2.41 per share.
EPS guidance does not assume any additional significant repurchases of the Company's Common Stock.
New store growth of approximately 5% to 7% over the store base at the end of 2011, for the most part an equal mix between Company-operated and franchised stores, and including a small number of HomeSmart stores. We expect overall new store growth in 2013 in the range of 4% to 6% over the store count at the end of 2012. This will be a net store growth after any opportunistic merging or disposition of stores.
The Company will continue, as warranted, to consolidate or sell stores not meeting performance goals.
The Company also plans to continue to acquire franchised stores or sell Company-operated stores as opportunities present themselves.
Conference Call
Aaron's will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Friday, October 26, 2012, at 10:00 am Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronsinc.com, in the "Investor Relations" section. The webcast will be archived for playback at that same site.
Aaron's, Inc., based in Atlanta, currently has more than 2,009 Company-operated and franchised stores in 48 states and Canada. The Company's Woodhaven Furniture Industries division manufactured approximately $89 million, at cost, of furniture and bedding at 14 facilities in eight states in 2011. The production of Woodhaven is for shipment to Aaron's stores.
"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aaron's, Inc.'s business that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, litigation, customer privacy, information security, customer demand and other issues, and the other risks and uncertainties discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. Statements in this release that are "forward-looking" include without limitation Aaron's projected revenues, earnings, and store openings for future periods.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release presents the Company's net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding a $36.5 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to a previously announced lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, and the subsequent reversal into income of $35.5 million of such charge in the first quarter of 2012 related to the settlement of that lawsuit, as well as a $10.4 million charge to earnings in the third quarter of 2012 for costs associated with the retirement of the Company's founder and Chairman of the Board. These measures are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").
While the lawsuit and retirement-related charges may not be considered as non-recurring in nature in a strictly accounting sense, management regards the circumstances of this particular lawsuit and retirement-related charge as infrequent and not arising out of the ordinary course of business. The adjustments involve matters that are not entirely susceptible to prediction or effective management, and consequently management believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding these adjustments is useful because it gives investors supplemental information to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's underlying core business from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

Fourth Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement
 
On December 13, 2012, Aarons, Inc. (the Company) entered into the Fourth Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement with the lending institutions listed on the respective signature pages thereof, and SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent for the lending institutions (the Credit Agreement Amendment). The Credit Agreement Amendment amends the Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of May 23, 2008, as amended as of March 31, 2011, May 18, 2011 and July 1, 2011 (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides, subject to certain terms and conditions, for unsecured borrowings by the Company of up to $140 million (including a letter of credit and swingline loan subfacility).
 
The Credit Agreement Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement until December 13, 2017, (ii) add and amend provisions applicable to lenders to further define instances of lender default, (iii) increase the dollar thresholds applicable to certain negative covenants, events of default and reporting and notice requirements to make them less restrictive, (iv) provide for the removal of certain financial covenants in the event that the agreement governing the Companys privately placed debt securities are amended to remove substantially similar covenants contained therein, and (v) replace the pricing grid schedule to the Credit Agreement to effect slight increases to certain applicable margins.
 
As described above, until and unless the agreement governing the Companys privately placed debt securities are amended to remove certain covenants contained therein, the Company will remain subject to the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement, which forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and require the maintenance of a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under the Credit Agreement, and the administrative agent and the requisite lenders thereunder would have the right to accelerate the maturity date of the Credit Agreement and exercise certain other default remedies. The Company expects that the agreement governing its privately placed debt securities will be amended in the near future such that the financial covenant under the Credit Agreement forbidding the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels will be removed.
 
Fifth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty
 
On December 13, 2012, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty with SunTrust Bank, as servicer, and the other participants listed on the respective signature pages thereof (the Franchisee Loan Facility Amendment). The Franchisee Loan Facility Amendment amends the Second Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty dated as of June 18, 2010, as amended as of March 31, 2011, May 18, 2011, July 1, 2011 and May 16, 2012 (the Franchisee Loan Facility). Pursuant to this facility, subject to certain terms and conditions, the Companys franchisees can borrow funds guaranteed by the Company. The Franchisee Loan Facility Amendment amends the Franchisee Loan Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date of the Franchisee Loan Facility until December 12, 2013, (ii) increase the maximum Canadian subfacility commitment amount for loans to franchisees that operate stores in Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec) from Cdn $35 million to Cdn $50 million, (iii) increase the dollar thresholds applicable to certain negative covenants, events of default and reporting and notice requirements to make them less restrictive, (iv) provide for the removal of certain financial covenants in the event that the agreement governing the Companys privately placed debt securities are amended to remove substantially similar covenants contained therein, (v) replace the pricing grid schedule to the Franchisee Loan Facility, to reduce the applicable margins and participant unused commitment fee percentages with respect to the funded participations, and (vi) amend and restate the Servicing Agreement, which sets forth the operations and procedures that are applicable to the Franchisee Loan Facility, in order to make certain clarifying changes and other modifications to certain of the operational provisions thereof as well as modify certain of the terms in the exhibits thereto.

As described above, until and unless the agreement governing the Companys privately placed debt securities are amended to remove certain covenants contained therein, the Company will remain subject to the financial covenants under the Franchisee Loan Facility, which forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and require the maintenance of a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under the Franchisee Loan Facility. The Company expects that the agreement governing its privately placed debt securities will be amended in the near future such that the financial covenant under the Franchise Loan Facility forbidding the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels will be removed.

Amendments
 
Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is amended by (i) replacing the definitions of Base Rate, Change in Control, Change in Law, Fee Letter, Material Indebtedness, Permitted Acquisition, Required Lenders and Revolving Commitment Termination Date in their entirety with the following definitions, (ii) by adding the following definitions of Defaulting Lender, Fourth Amendment Date, Lender Insolvency Event, Material Subsidiary, Non-Defaulting Lender and 2011 Note Agreement and (iii) by deleting the definition of the Loudermilk Family:

Any payment of Guarantor hereunder may be applied to any of the Liabilities as Lender may choose. The obligation of Guarantor to Lender hereunder is primary, absolute and unconditional.
 
4.          TERM OF GUARANTY.         Guarantor acknowledges that there may be future advances by Lender to Borrower (although Lender may be under no obligation to make such advances) and that the number and amount of the Liabilities are unlimited and may fluctuate from time to time hereafter. Guarantor expressly agrees that Guarantors obligation hereunder shall remain absolute, primary and unconditional notwithstanding such future advances and fluctuations, if any, and agrees that, in any event, this agreement is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in force at all times hereafter, whether there are any Liabilities outstanding or not, until all originals hereof are returned to Guarantor by Lender or until a written notice from Guarantor terminating this Guaranty has been received and acknowledged by Lender, but such written termination shall not release Guarantor from any obligation for payment of (i) any and all Liabilities then in existence; (ii) any renewals or extensions thereof, in whole or in part, whether such renewals or extensions are made before or after such termination; and (iii) any damages, losses, costs, interest, charges, attorneys fees or expenses then or thereafter incurred in connection with the Liabilities or any renewals or extensions thereof.
 
5.          PROPERTY IN LENDERS POSSESSION.         As security for the payment of the Liabilities and the obligation of Guarantor hereunder, Guarantor hereby assigns and grants a security interest to Lender in: (i) all property of Guarantor in or coming into the possession, control, or custody of Lender, or in which Lender has or hereafter acquires a lien, security interest, or other right; and (ii) any existing or hereafter created lien or security interest in favor of Guarantor in any property of Borrower. Guarantor hereby agrees that any rights Guarantor may now or hereafter have in any collateral securing any of the Liabilities or against Borrower or any property of Borrower, including rights arising by virtue of subrogation or otherwise, shall be subordinate and junior to Lenders rights to said collateral or property and to Lenders indefeasible right to the prior payment of the Liabilities. Guarantor hereby grants to Lender a lien on, and a security interest in, the deposit balances, funds, accounts, items, certificates of deposit, securities, other property and the monies of Guarantor now or hereafter in the possession or custody of Lender for any purpose (including property left in safekeeping or custody) or on deposit with Lender to secure, and as collateral for, the payment and performance of this Guaranty as well as of any other obligation or liability (present or future, absolute or contingent, due or not due) of Guarantor to Lender. Lender may at any time and from time to time, without demand or notice, appropriate and set off against such deposit balances, funds, accounts, items, certificates of deposit, securities, other property and monies and apply the same to the obligations of Guarantor hereunder.

6.          CONSENT TO LENDERS ACTS. Guarantor hereby consents and agrees that, at any time or times, without notice to or further approval of Guarantor or Borrower, and without in any way affecting the obligation of Guarantor hereunder, Lender may, with or without consideration: (i) release, compromise, or agree not to sue, in whole or in part, Borrower, any Guarantor or any other obligor, guarantor, endorser or surety upon any of the Liabilities; (ii) waive, rescind, renew, extend, modify , increase, decrease, delete, terminate, amend, or accelerate in accordance with its terms, either in whole or in part, any of the Liabilities, any other terms thereof, or any agreement, covenant, condition, or obligation of or with Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other obligor, guarantor, endorser or surety upon any of the Liabilities; and (iii) apply any payment received from Borrower, any Guarantor or any other obligor, guarantor, endorser or surety upon any of the Liabilities to any of the Liabilities which Lender may choose. Further, Lender may at any time, either with or without consideration, surrender, release or receive any property or other security of any kind or nature whatsoever held by it or any Person on its behalf or for its account securing any indebtedness of Borrower or any Liability, or substitute any collateral so held by Lender for other collateral of like kind or of any kind, without notice to or further consent from Guarantor, and such surrender, receipt, release or substitution shall not in any way affect the obligation of Guarantor hereunder. Lender shall have full authority to adjust, compromise and receive less than the amount due upon any such collateral, and may enter into any accord and satisfaction agreement as deemed advisable by Lender without affecting the obligation of Guarantor hereunder. Lender shall be under no duty to undertake to collect upon such collateral or any part thereof, and shall not be liable for any negligence or mistake in judgment in handling disposing of, obtaining, or failing to collect upon, or perfecting or maintaining a security interest in, any such collateral and any such actions by Lender will not release Guarantor from any obligation under this Guaranty.
 
7.          WAIVERS BY GUARANTOR. Guarantor waives: (i) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty by Lender and of the creation, extension or renewal of any Liability to which it relates and of any default by Borrower; (ii) notice of presentment, demand for payment, notice of dishonor or protest of any of Borrowers obligations or the obligation of any Person held by Lender as collateral security for any Liability; (iii) notice of the failure of any Person to pay to Lender any indebtedness held by Lender as collateral security for any Liability; (iv) failure of Lender to obtain and perfect or maintain the perfection or priority of any security interest or lien on property to secure any Liability; (v) any defense resulting from the failure of Lender to have any other Person execute this Guaranty or execute any other guaranty relating to a credit facility guaranty relating to a credit facility granted to Borrower; (vi) any failure to promptly commence suit against any party thereto or liable thereon or to give any notice to or make any claim or demand upon Guarantor or Borrower; and (vii) all defenses, offsets and counterclaims which Guarantor may at any time have to any claim of Lender against Borrower. No act, failure to act, or omission of any kind on the part of Guarantor, Borrower, Lender or any Person shall be a legal or equitable discharge or release of Guarantor hereunder unless agreed to hereafter in writing by Lender. This Guaranty shall not be affected by any change which may arise by reason of the death of Guarantor, or of any partner(s) of Guarantor, or of Borrower, or by reason of the accession to any such partnership of any one or more new partners. Guarantor further agrees that this instrument shall continue to be effective or be reinstated as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of the principal or interest on any of the Liabilities is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
8.          BORROWER AUTHORIZATION. This Guaranty covers all Liabilities to Lender purporting to be made on behalf of Borrower by any officer, agent or partner of Borrower, without regard to the actual authority of such officer, agent or partner to bind Borrower, and without regard to the capacity of Borrower or whether the organization or charter of Borrower is in any way defective.
 
9.          PAYMENT EVENTS, SUBROGATION RIGHTS. In the event of : (i) the death, incompetency, dissolution or insolvency (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect at the time) of Borrower or any Guarantor; or (ii) any final judgment for money damages be entered against Borrower or any Guarantor in a court of competent jurisdiction and remains unsatisfied for a period of thirty (30) days or more; or (iii) a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Borrower or any Guarantor is owned by any person or entity, or any group of related persons or entities, other than any person or entity, or any group of related persons or entities, that has such majority ownership as of the date of the execution of this Guaranty; or (iv) written notice from any Guarantor terminating this Guaranty is received and acknowledged by Lender, and whether or not any such event occurs at a time when any Liabilities are otherwise due and payable, Guarantor agrees to pay to Lender upon demand the full amount which would be payable hereunder by Guarantor if all Liabilities were then due and payable. If a bankruptcy or insolvency action be filed by or against Borrower or any Guarantor or if a receiver be appointed for any part of the property or assets of Borrower or any Guarantor, whether or not such event occurs at a time when any of the Liabilities are otherwise due and payable, then simultaneously therewith Guarantor will be obligated to pay to Lender the full amount which would be payable hereunder by Guarantor if all Liabilities were then due and payable, all without notice or demand from Lender. Until all obligations of Guarantor to Lender have been paid in full, Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation and hereby waives any right to enforce any remedy which Lender now has or may hereafter have against Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral now or hereafter held by Lender.

10.         SUBORDINATION. In the event that for any reason whatsoever, Borrower is now or hereafter becomes indebted to Guarantor, Guarantor agrees that the amount of such indebtedness and all interest thereon shall at all times be subordinate as to lien, time of payment and in all other respects to all Liabilities which are covered by this Guaranty, and that Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or receive payment thereof until all sums then due and owing to Lender shall have been paid in full. If any payment shall have been made to Guarantor by Borrower on any said indebtedness during any time that there are Liabilities outstanding, Guarantor shall hold in trust all such payments for the benefit of Lender and shall make said payments to Lender to be credited and applied against the Liabilities, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the discretion of Lender.
 
11.         REPRESENTATIONS BY GUARANTOR. Guarantor represents that, at the time of the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, nothing exists to impair the effectiveness of the obligation of Guarantor to Lender hereunder, or this Guaranty becoming effective immediately.
 
12.         REMEDIES OF LENDER. Lender may at its option proceed in the first instance against Guarantor to collect any Liability, without first proceeding against Borrower for said Liability, or any other Person liable for said Liability, and without first resorting to any property at any time held by Lender as collateral security for any Liability and without any marshalling of assets whatsoever. Guarantor further authorizes Lender, without notice or demand, to apply any indebtedness due or to become due to Guarantor from Lender in satisfaction of any of the Liabilities and Guarantors obligation hereunder, including, but not limited to, the right to set-off against any deposits of Guarantor with Lender. Lender shall further have any other rights provided by law or under any other document, all of which rights are cumulative. GUARANTOR HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE ATTACHMENT OR GARNISHMENT OF GUARANTORS EARNINGS. The obligation of each Guarantor hereby created is joint and several, and Lender is authorized and empowered to proceed against Guarantor or any of them, without joining Borrower or any other Guarantor. All of said parties may be sued together, or any of them may be sued separately without first or contemporaneously suing the others. There shall be no duty or obligation upon Lender, whether by notice or otherwise: (i) to proceed against Borrower or any other Guarantor; (ii) to initiate any proceeding or exhaust any remedy against Borrower or any other Guarantor; or (iii) to give any notice to any other Guarantor or Borrower, whatsoever, before bringing suit, exercising any rights to any collateral or security, or instituting proceedings of any kind against Borrower, Guarantor or any of them.
 
13.         INUREMENT, GOVERNING LAW, COSTS AND EXPENSES. This agreement shall bind any inure to the benefit of Lender, its successors and assigns, and likewise shall bind an inure to the benefit of Guarantor, the heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, estates, successors and assigns of the Guarantor. This agreement and its performance, interpretation and enforcement shall in all respects be governed by the laws of the State indicated in Lenders address as shown above. Guarantor waives any and all privilege and rights which Guarantor may have under state statute, relating to venue, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended. Any legal action brought on this Guaranty may, at Lenders discretion, be brought in the appropriate court for the county in which the Lenders address, indicated above, is located or in such other court as provided by law. If any legal action or actions are instituted by Lender to enforce any of its rights against Guarantor hereunder, then Guarantor, jointly and severally, agrees to pay Lender all expenses incurred by Lender relative to such legal action or actions, including, but not limited to, court costs plus 15% of the total amount of principal and accrued interest then due Lender hereunder as attorneys fees.

14.           WAIVER OF HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION RIGHTS AND BORROWER DEFENSES. Guarantor hereby ratifies, confirms, and adopts all the terms, conditions, agreements and stipulations of all notes and other evidences of the Liabilities heretofore or hereafter executed. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor waives and renounces any and all homestead or exemption rights Guarantor may have under or by virtue of the Constitution or laws of any state, or the United States, as against the obligation hereby created, provided, however, that such waiver shall not apply to any obligation created hereunder which arises from any of the Liabilities that are consumer credit transactions; and Guarantor does hereby transfer, convey and assign, and direct any Trustee in Bankruptcy or receiver to deliver to Lender, a sufficient amount of property or money in any homestead or exemption that may be allowed to Guarantor to pay any Liability in full and all costs of collection. Guarantor also waives and renounces any defense to any of the Liabilities which may be available to or could be asserted by Borrower, except for payment.
 
15.           FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. At the request of Lender, Guarantor shall, from time to time, prepare and deliver to Lender a complete and current financial statement setting forth all the assets and liabilities of Guarantor (and to the extent any Person other than Guarantor, including a spouse of Guarantor, has any interest in said assets or is jointly liable for any of said liabilities, said matters shall be set forth in their entirety in the financial statements), signed by Guarantor under oath as being true and correct.
 
16.           INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION OF FACTS. Guarantors execution of this Guaranty was not based upon any facts or materials provided by Lender nor was Guarantor induced to execute this Guaranty by any representation, statement or analysis made by Lender. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that Guarantor assumes sole responsibility for independently obtaining any information or reports deemed advisable by Guarantor with regard to Borrower or any other Guarantor, and Guarantor agrees to rely solely on the information or reports so obtained in reaching any decision to execute or not to terminate this Guaranty. Guarantor and agrees that Lender is and shall be under no obligation now or in the future to furnish any information to Guarantor concerning Borrower, the Liabilities or any other Guarantor, and that Lender does not and shall not be deemed in the future to warrant the accuracy of any information or representation concerning the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person which may induce the Guarantor to execute, or not to terminate this Guaranty.
 
17.           MISCELLANEOUS. All of the Lenders rights and remedies are cumulative and those granted hereunder are in addition to any rights and remedies available to the Lender under law. If any provision of this agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstances shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of this agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the full extent permitted by law. The failure or forbearance of Lender to exercise any right hereunder, or otherwise granted to it by law or another agreement, shall not affect the obligation of Guarantor hereunder and shall not constitute a waiver of said right. This Guaranty contains the entire agreement between the parties, and no provision hereof may be waived, modified, or altered except by a writing executed by Guarantor and Lender. There is no understanding that any Person other than or in addition to Guarantor shall execute this Guaranty. The captions to the paragraphs are for convenience only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.
 
 
 
18.           JURY WAIVER. GUARANTOR AND LENDER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY, AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT EITHER OF THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND OTHER DOCUMENT OR INSTRUMENT CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONJUNCTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR LENDER TO EXTEND, OR TO CONTINUE TO EXTEND, CREDIT OR OTHER FINANCIAL ACCOMMODATIONS TO BORROWER. FURTHER, GUARANTOR HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF LENDER, NOR THE LENDERS COUNSEL HAS REPRESNETED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT LENDER WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF THE LENDER, NOT LENDERS COUNSEL HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WAIVE, CONDITION, OR MODIFY THIS PROVISION.
 
19.           WAIVER OF O.C.G.A SECTION 10-7-24. If this Guaranty is executed or enforced in Georgia, or if the obligations guaranteed hereby are due and payable in Georgia, or if this Guaranty is governed by the laws of Georgia, then Guarantor waives all rights under Section 10-7-24 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, as amended, including any right to require Lender to proceed against Borrower.
 
Guarantor has read, understands, and agrees to the provisions of this Guaranty and has executed the same voluntarily, under seal, with full authority and with the intent to be legally bound by its terms, conditions, and obligations.

Further, Lender may at any time, either with or without consideration, surrender, release or receive any property or other security of any kind or nature whatsoever held by it or any Person on its behalf or for its account securing any indebtedness of Borrower or any Liability, or substitute any collateral so held by Lender for other collateral of like kind or of any kind, without notice to or further consent from Guarantor, and such surrender, receipt, release or substitution shall not in any way affect the obligation of Guarantor hereunder. Lender shall have full authority to adjust, compromise and receive less than the amount due upon any such collateral, and may enter into any accord and satisfaction agreement as deemed advisable by Lender without affecting the obligation of Guarantor hereunder. Lender shall be under no duty to undertake to collect upon such collateral or any part thereof, and shall not be liable for any negligence or mistake in judgment in handling disposing of, obtaining, or failing to collect upon, or perfecting or maintaining a security interest in, any such collateral and any such actions by Lender will not release Guarantor from any obligation under this Guarantee.

No act, failure to act, or omission of any kind on the part of Guarantor, Borrower, Lender or any Person shall be a legal or equitable discharge or release of Guarantor hereunder unless agreed to hereafter in writing by Lender. This Guarantee shall not be affected by any change which may arise by reason of the death of Guarantor, or of any partner(s) of Guarantor, or of Borrower, or by reason of the accession to any such partnership of any one or more new partners. Guarantor further agrees that this instrument shall continue to be effective or be reinstated as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of the principal or interest on any of the Liabilities is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. In any claim by the Lender against the Guarantor, the Guarantor may not claim or assert any set-off, counterclaim, claim or other right that either the Guarantor or the Borrower may have against the Lender or any other person.

           BORROWER AUTHORIZATION. This Guarantee covers all Liabilities to Lender purporting to be made on behalf of Borrower by any officer, agent or partner of Borrower, without regard to the actual authority of such officer, agent or partner to bind Borrower, and without regard to the capacity of Borrower or whether the organization or charter of Borrower is in any way defective.
10.
 
STAY OF ACCELERATION. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Lender in respect of the Liabilities is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement or reorganization of the Borrower or any moratorium affecting the payment of the Liabilities, all such amounts that would otherwise be subject to acceleration will nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on the demand by the Lender.
11.            
 
           PAYMENT EVENTS, SUBROGATION RIGHTS.

If a bankruptcy or insolvency action be filed by or against Borrower or any Guarantor or if a receiver be appointed for any part of the property or assets of Borrower or any Guarantor, whether or not such event occurs at a time when any of the Liabilities are otherwise due and payable, then simultaneously therewith Guarantor will be obligated to pay to Lender the full amount which would be payable hereunder by Guarantor if all Liabilities were then due and payable, all without notice or demand from Lender. Until all obligations of Guarantor to Lender have been paid in full, Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation and hereby waives any right to enforce any remedy which Lender now has or may hereafter have against Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral now or hereafter held by Lender.

If any payment shall have been made to Guarantor by Borrower on any said indebtedness during any time that there are Liabilities outstanding, Guarantor shall hold in trust all such payments for the benefit of Lender and shall make said payments to Lender to be credited and applied against the Liabilities, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the discretion of Lender.

REMEDIES OF LENDER.

Guarantor further authorizes Lender, without notice or demand, to apply any indebtedness due or to become due to Guarantor from Lender in satisfaction of any of the Liabilities and Guarantors obligation hereunder, including, but not limited to, the right to set-off against any deposits of Guarantor with Lender. Lender shall further have any other rights provided by law or under any other document, all of which rights are cumulative. The obligation of each Guarantor hereby created is joint and several, and Lender is authorized and empowered to proceed against Guarantor or any of them, without joining Borrower or any other Guarantor. All of said parties may be sued together, or any of them may be sued separately without first or contemporaneously suing the others. There shall be no duty or obligation upon Lender, whether by notice or otherwise: (i) to proceed against Borrower or any other Guarantor; (ii) to initiate any proceeding or exhaust any remedy against Borrower or any other Guarantor; or (iii) to give any notice to any other Guarantor or Borrower, whatsoever, before bringing suit, exercising any rights to any collateral or security, or instituting proceedings of any kind against Borrower, Guarantor or any of them.

This agreement and its performance, interpretation and enforcement shall in all respects be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein. Guarantor waives any and all privilege and rights which Guarantor may have under provincial or territorial statute, relating to venue, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended. Any legal action brought on this Guarantee may, at Lenders discretion, be brought in the appropriate court for the jurisdiction in which the Lenders address, indicated above, is located or in such other court as provided by law. If any legal action or actions are instituted by Lender to enforce any of its rights against Guarantor hereunder, then Guarantor, jointly and severally, agrees to pay Lender all expenses incurred by Lender relative to such legal action or actions, on a substantial indemnity basis.
16.            
 
           WAIVER OF BORROWER DEFENSES. Guarantor hereby ratifies, confirms, and adopts all the terms, conditions, agreements and stipulations of all notes and other evidences of the Liabilities heretofore or hereafter executed. Guarantor also waives and renounces any defense to any of the Liabilities which may be available to or could be asserted by Borrower, except for payment.
17.
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. At the request of Lender, Guarantor shall, from time to time, prepare and deliver to Lender a complete and current financial statement setting forth all the assets and liabilities of Guarantor (and to the extent any Person other than Guarantor, including a spouse of Guarantor, has any interest in said assets or is jointly liable for any of said liabilities, said matters shall be set forth in their entirety in the financial statements), signed by Guarantor under oath as being true and correct.
18.            
 
           INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION OF FACTS. Guarantors execution of this Guarantee was not based upon any facts or materials provided by Lender, nor was Guarantor induced to execute this Guarantee by any representation, statement or analysis made by Lender. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that Guarantor assumes sole responsibility for independently obtaining any information or reports deemed advisable by Guarantor with regard to Borrower or any other Guarantor, and Guarantor agrees to rely solely on the information or reports so obtained in reaching any decision to execute or not to terminate this Guarantee. Guarantor and agrees that Lender is and shall be under no obligation now or in the future to furnish any information to Guarantor concerning Borrower, the Liabilities or any other Guarantor, and that Lender does not and shall not be deemed in the future to warrant the accuracy of any information or representation concerning the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person which may induce the Guarantor to execute, or not to terminate this Guarantee.
19.
 
  
 
           MISCELLANEOUS. All of the Lenders rights and remedies are cumulative and those granted hereunder are in addition to any rights and remedies available to the Lender under law. If any provision of this agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstances shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of this agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the full extent permitted by law. The failure or forbearance of Lender to exercise any right hereunder, or otherwise granted to it by law or another agreement, shall not affect the obligation of Guarantor hereunder and shall not constitute a waiver of said right. This Guarantee contains the entire agreement between the parties, and no provision hereof may be waived, modified, or altered except by a writing executed by Guarantor and Lender. There is no understanding that any Person other than or in addition to Guarantor shall execute this Guarantee. The captions to the paragraphs are for convenience only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.

Amendment No. 1 to Note Purchase Agreement
 
On December 19, 2012, Aarons, Inc. (the Company) entered into Amendment No. 1 to Note Purchase Agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America and certain other purchasers, as set forth on the signature pages thereof (the Prudential Notes Amendment). The Prudential Notes Amendment amends the Note Purchase Agreement dated as of July 5, 2011 (the Prudential Notes Agreement), pursuant to which the Company and its subsidiaries, Aaron Investment Company, Aarons Production Company and 99LTO, LLC, as co-obligors, issued $125 million in senior unsecured notes to the purchasers in a private placement. The notes bear interest at the rate of 3.75% per year and mature on April 27, 2018.
 
The Prudential Notes Amendment amends the Prudential Notes Agreement to, among other things, (i) remove the Total Adjusted Debt to Total Adjusted Capitalization Ratio financial covenant that forbids the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels and (ii) increase the dollar thresholds applicable to certain negative covenants, events of default and reporting and notice requirements to make them less restrictive. The Company remains subject to certain other financial covenants under the Prudential Notes Agreement, which require the Company to maintain a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under the Prudential Notes Agreement and the purchasers would have the right to exercise certain default remedies.
 
The foregoing description of the Prudential Notes Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such document, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Automatic Amendments to Credit Facilities
 
As previously disclosed, the agreements governing certain credit facilities maintained by the Company were recently amended to provide that, upon removal of enumerated financial covenants from the Prudential Notes Agreement, the substantially similar financial covenants contained therein would be automatically removed, provided that certain notice requirements are met. Accordingly, as of December 19, 2012, the effective date of the Prudential Notes Amendment, the Total Adjusted Debt to Total Adjusted Capitalization Ratio financial covenants that forbid the Company from exceeding certain debt to equity levels in each of the Companys Revolving Credit Agreement with the lending institutions listed on the respective signature pages thereof, and SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent for the lending institutions, dated as of May 23, 2008, as amended (the Revolving Credit Agreement), and the Companys Second Amended and Restated Loan Facility Agreement and Guaranty with SunTrust Bank, as servicer, and the other participants listed on the respective signature pages thereof, dated as of June 18, 2010, as amended (the Franchisee Loan Facility), were each automatically removed, after notice was duly given to remove such financial covenants. The Company remains subject to certain other financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Franchisee Loan Facility, which require the Company to maintain a minimum net worth ratio, a minimum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, the Company will be in default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Franchisee Loan Facility, and the administrative agent and the requisite lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement would have the right to accelerate the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Agreement and exercise certain other default remedies, and the servicer and the requisite participants under the Franchisee Loan Facility would have the right to exercise certain default remedies.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On February 7, 2013, Aarons, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release to announce its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The press release presents the Companys net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding: a $36.5 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to a previously announced lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, and the subsequent reversal into income of $35.5 million of such charge in the first quarter of 2012 related to the settlement of that lawsuit; a $10.4 million charge to earnings in the third quarter of 2012 for costs associated with the previously announced retirement of the Companys founder and former Chairman of the Board; and a $3.5 million separation charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the previously announced departure of the Companys former Chief Executive Officer. These measures are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
 
While the lawsuit may not be considered as non-recurring in nature in a strictly accounting sense, management regards the circumstances of this particular lawsuit as infrequent and not arising out of the ordinary course of business. Similarly, while separation or retirement charges do arise, management regards the size of the retirement and separation-related charges for the particular individuals who departed  one, the Companys founder and Chairman of the Board at retirement, and the other, its former President and Chief Executive Officer  as uncommon. The adjustments involve matters that are not entirely susceptible to prediction or effective management, and consequently management believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding these adjustments is useful because it gives investors supplemental information to evaluate and compare the performance of the Companys underlying core business from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Companys GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

On a non-GAAP basis, excluding from all periods these charges and reversals, net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 would have been $36.6 million compared to $32.7 million for the same period in 2011, and earnings per share assuming dilution would have been $.48 compared to $.43 a year ago, a 12% increase. Additionally, non-GAAP net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been $157.4 million compared to $138.6 million a year ago, up 14% over the same period in 2011, and earnings per share assuming dilution would have been $2.04 versus $1.75 last year, a 17% increase.
"We are pleased with the Company's performance for the fourth quarter and year ended 2012, both records in revenues and earnings," said Ronald W. Allen, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron's. "The results for the year were the best in the Company's history and at the high end of our initial expectations, including a 6.6% increase in store count. Customer growth during the quarter and the year was excellent, as demand remains strong for our high-quality, affordable basic home furnishings."
"During the fourth quarter of 2012, we offered a Black Friday promotion that was extremely successful, giving customers the option of immediate delivery of products with no payments until January," Mr. Allen continued. "We had an excellent response to this promotion and delivered a record number of agreements during the time period. The results far exceeded our expectations and did cause a deferral of more revenue than anticipated until 2013 when customers began paying for the merchandise. Although this revenue was not recognized in 2012, we recorded the expense in the quarter associated with executing the promotion."
"Our HomeSmart weekly rental business, which currently consists of 78 Company-operated stores and one franchised store, grew revenues during the quarter to $14.8 million and for the year to $55.2 million. The division lost approximately $.01 per diluted share in the quarter and $.06 per diluted share for the year as the stores were growing and being developed. As we have previously stated, there are no current plans to open a significant number of additional HomeSmart stores until after the first half of this year. Under new leadership we are making progress with this division and believe that the HomeSmart performance will continue to improve in 2013," Mr. Allen concluded.
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both quarters) increased 4.6% during the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and customer count on a same store basis was up 7.8%. For Company-operated stores open over two years at the end of December 2012, same store revenues increased 3.1% during the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The Company had 1,134,000 customers and its franchisees had 604,000 customers at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012, an 11.0% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the fourth quarter a year ago (customers of our franchisees, however, are not customers of Aaron's, Inc.).
During fiscal year 2012, the Company generated approximately $60 million of cash flow from operations and had $130 million of cash on hand at the end of December. The Company reacquired 1,236,689 shares during 2012 and has authorization to purchase an additional 4,044,655 shares.
Division Results
The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division increased its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 to $539.8 million, an 8% increase over the $498.7 million in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011. Sales and lease ownership revenues for fiscal year 2012 increased 8% to $2.089 billion compared to $1.939 billion for the same period a year ago.
Revenues of the HomeSmart division increased in the fourth quarter to $14.8 million, compared to $8.9 million in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011. HomeSmart revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $55.2 million versus $15.6 million for the same period a year ago.
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2012 increased 9% and 11%, respectively, over the comparable previous year periods. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 7% for the fourth quarter and 5% year to date compared to the same periods in 2011. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, increased 8% to $126.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from $117.8 million in the comparable period in 2011, and increased 10% to $425.9 million for the year compared to $389.0 million last year. The increases in the Company's franchise royalties and fees and non-retail sales are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, who, collectively, had revenues of $241.9 million during the fourth quarter and $975.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2012, a 7% increase, over both the prior year periods. Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores increased 6.5% and 9.6%, respectively, for the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aaron's, Inc.
Store Count
During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company opened 37 Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 26 franchised stores and two RIMCO stores. The Company also acquired two franchised stores and the accounts of five third-party stores, sold one Company-operated Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership store to a franchisee, and opened one and closed one Company-operated HomeSmart store. One Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership store was closed during the quarter.
Through the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, the Company awarded area development agreements to open nine and 45 additional franchised stores, respectively. At December 31, 2012, there were area development agreements outstanding for the opening of 180 franchised stores over the next several years.
At December 31, 2012, the Company had 1,227 Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 742 franchised Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 78 Company-operated HomeSmart stores, one franchised HomeSmart store, 19 Company-operated RIMCO stores and six franchised RIMCO stores. The total number of stores open at December 31, 2012 was 2,073.
First Quarter and Full Year 2013 Outlook
The Company is updating its guidance for 2013 and expects to achieve the following:
First quarter revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of approximately $630 million.
First quarter diluted earnings per share in the range of $.70 to $.74 per share.
Fiscal year 2013 revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of approximately $2.4 billion.
GAAP fiscal year 2013 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.25 to $2.41, unchanged from previous guidance.
EPS guidance does not assume any additional significant repurchases of the Company's Common Stock.
New store growth of approximately 4% to 6% over the store base at the end of 2012, for the most part an equal mix between Company-operated and franchised stores, and including a small number of HomeSmart stores.  This will be a net store growth after any opportunistic merging or disposition of stores.
The Company will continue, as warranted, to consolidate or sell stores not meeting performance goals.
The Company also plans to continue to acquire franchised stores or sell Company-operated stores as opportunities present themselves.
Conference Call
Aaron's will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results on Thursday, February 7, 2013, at 5:00 pm Eastern Time. The public is invited to listen to the conference call by webcast accessible through the Company's website, www.aaronsinc.com, in the "Investor Relations" section. The webcast will be archived for playback at that same site.
Aaron's, Inc., based in Atlanta, currently has more than 2,073 Company-operated and franchised stores in 48 states and Canada. The Company's Woodhaven Furniture Industries division manufactured approximately $95 million, at cost, of furniture and bedding at 14 facilities in seven states in 2012. The production of Woodhaven is for shipment to Aaron's stores.
"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this news release regarding Aaron's, Inc.'s business that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, litigation, customer privacy, information security, customer demand and other issues, and the other risks and uncertainties discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. Statements in this release that are "forward-looking" include without limitation Aaron's projected revenues, earnings, and store openings for future periods.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release presents the Company's net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding: a $36.5 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2011 related to a lawsuit verdict against the Company, and associated legal fees and expenses, and the subsequent reversal into income of $35.5 million of such charge in the first quarter of 2012 related to the settlement of that lawsuit; a $10.4 million charge to earnings in the third quarter of 2012 for costs associated with the retirement of the Company's founder and Chairman of the Board; and a $3.5 million separation charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the departure of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. These measures are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").
While the lawsuit may not be considered as non-recurring in nature in a strictly accounting sense, management regards the circumstances of this particular lawsuit as infrequent and not arising out of the ordinary course of business. Similarly, while separation or retirement charges do arise, management regards the size of the retirement and separation-related charges for the particular individuals who departed  one, the Company's founder and Chairman of the Board at retirement, and the other, its President and Chief Executive Officer  as uncommon. The adjustments involve matters that are not entirely susceptible to prediction or effective management, and consequently management believes that presentation of net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding these adjustments is useful because it gives investors supplemental information to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company's underlying core business from period to period. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share, which are also presented in the press release.

Aaron's, Inc. Reports First Quarter Results
- Lease Revenues Up 8%; Total Revenues a Record $595.1 Million
- Same Store Revenues Increase 3.4%
- Net Earnings $51.0 Million
- Diluted EPS of $.67, Up 5% on a Non-GAAP Basis
ATLANTA, April 25, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Aaron's, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), a leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced revenues and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
For the first quarter of 2013, revenue increased 2% to a record $595.1 million compared to $586.0 million for the first quarter in 2012. Net earnings were $51.0 million versus $71.2 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $.67 compared to $.92 per share a year ago.
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company recognized $35.5 million of income related to the settlement of a lawsuit. Excluding the reversal of the lawsuit-related accrual, diluted earnings per share would have increased 5% to $.67 versus $.64 in the same period a year ago.
Lease revenues and fees were up 8% for the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period last year. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchisees, decreased 21% for the quarter compared to the first quarter last year due to less demand for products by franchisees.
"While revenues and Non-GAAP earnings are above last year's first quarter results, we expected more growth. Demand by customers in both our Company-operated and franchised stores has been less than anticipated," said Ronald W. Allen, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aaron's. "We believe results for the quarter were affected by the overall difficult economic environment for our middle to lower income customers, including increases in their payroll taxes and delays in their income tax refunds. Although same store revenue and customer count growth remains very good, this growth was less than planned which resulted in the first quarter operating results being below expectations. Based upon these results and current market conditions, we are reducing our revenue and earnings guidance for the year."
"We are pleased to report that the results of our Black Friday promotion last November have been good, and the retention of customers and lease agreements have been in line with historical customer behavior," Mr. Allen continued. "In addition, our HomeSmart weekly rental business grew revenues during the quarter to $16.9 million, and recorded a loss of $188,000, well below an expected loss of $1 million. We believe the HomeSmart results for the rest of the year will continue to improve and, as we have previously stated, a decision on further new store openings will be made in the latter half of this year. If current operating trends and expectations remain positive, we can anticipate adding a significant number of new HomeSmart stores in 2014 and beyond."
Same store revenues (revenues earned in Company-operated stores open for the entirety of both quarters) increased 3.4% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, and customer count on a same store basis was up 4.1%. For Company-operated stores open over two years at the end of March 2013, same store revenues increased 1.8% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The Company had 1,108,000 customers and its franchisees had 592,000 customers at the end of the most recent quarter, a 6% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the first quarter a year ago (customers of franchisees, however, are not customers of Aaron's, Inc.).
During the first quarter of this year, the Company generated over $103 million of cash flow from operations, and had $210 million of cash on hand at the end of March 2013. The Company did not reacquire shares during the first quarter, but has authorization to purchase an additional 4,044,655 shares.
Division Results
Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division revenues increased $4.5 million in the first quarter to $575.3 million compared to $570.8 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2012.
Revenues of the HomeSmart division increased in the first quarter to $16.9 million, a $4.4 million increase over the $12.5 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2012.
Components of Revenue
Consolidated lease revenues and fees for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013 increased 8% over the comparable previous year period. In addition, franchise royalties and fees increased 4% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2012. Non-retail sales decreased 21% for the quarter compared to the first quarter last year. The increases in the Company's franchise royalties and fees are the result of an increase in revenues of the Company's franchisees, which collectively had revenues of $269.5 million during the first quarter, a 2% increase over the comparable 2012 period. Same store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores were up 2.6% and 6.6%, respectively, for the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aaron's, Inc.
Store Count
During the first quarter of 2013, the Company opened four Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, seven franchised stores, and one RIMCO store. The Company also acquired one franchised store. Two Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores were closed during the quarter.
Through the three months ended March 31, 2013, the Company awarded area development agreements to open four additional franchised stores. At March 31, 2013, there were area development agreements outstanding for the opening of 176 franchised stores over the next several years.
At March 31, 2013, the Company had 1,230 Company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 748 franchised Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 78 Company-operated HomeSmart stores, one franchised HomeSmart store, 20 Company-operated RIMCO stores, and six franchised RIMCO stores. The total number of stores open at March 31, 2013 was 2,083.
Second Quarter and Full Year 2013 Outlook
The Company is updating its guidance for 2013 and expects to achieve the following:
Second quarter revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of approximately $565 million.
Second quarter diluted earnings per share in the range of $.45 to $.49 per share, which includes approximately $.04 per share in one-time charges relating to the retirement of the Company's Chief Operating Officer and a change in vacation policies.
Fiscal year 2013 revenues (excluding revenues of franchisees) of approximately $2.35 billion, a decrease over the previous guidance of approximately $2.4 billion.
Fiscal year 2013 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.11 to $2.23, which includes the above mentioned one-time charges, a decrease from the previous guidance of $2.25 to $2.41.
EPS guidance does not assume any significant repurchases of the Company's Common Stock.
New store growth of approximately 4% to 6% over the store base at the end of 2012, for the most part an equal mix between Company-operated and franchised stores, and including a small number of HomeSmart stores.  This will be a net store growth after any opportunistic merging or disposition of stores.

Exhibit 99.1
Aaron's, Inc. Names Dave Buck COO; Ken Butler Retires After 39-Year Career At Aaron's
ATLANTA, April 25, 2013  Aaron's, Inc. (AAN), a lease-to-own retailer specializing in the sales and lease ownership of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, announced today that David L. Buck has been named Chief Operating Officer. Ken Butler, age 60, will be retiring as COO after a 39-year career at Aaron's effective May 1. He will also resign from the Aaron's Board of Directors.
"Dave knows every facet of Aaron's operationally, having learned this through his lengthy career at Aaron's," said Ronald W. Allen, Aaron's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "He is an excellent choice to lead Aaron's long-tenured and deep management team supervising our stores. We're very excited to name Dave as the COO and look forward to his leadership in his new role."
Buck, age 63, was promoted to Senior Vice President, Operations earlier this year. He has risen steadily through the Aaron's management development program during his 24 years with the company. Buck began his career with Aaron's in 1989 as Manager Trainee and then Store Manager. Within a two-year period, he was promoted to Regional Manager and subsequently Regional Vice President and Operational Vice President. He has won numerous "Region of the Year" awards and recently secured his second consecutive "Best Overall Operations" award for 2012. For 15 years prior to joining Aaron's, Buck handled operations for several other rent-to-own companies.
Regarding Butler's long-standing service to Aaron's, Allen said, "Ken has truly been part of the DNA of Aaron's and has helped lead the drive for operational excellence amid tremendous growth over the past four decades. The entire company thanks him for his non-stop dedication to creating a nationally-recognizable brand and helping many of Aaron's customers achieve their goal of obtaining brand-name products through our revolutionary lease-to-own model."
In January 1974, Butler joined Aaron's as a Manager Trainee and rose quickly in the ranks, moving from store management in Washington, D.C. to regional management in Texas, Louisiana and California. In 1983, he returned to Atlanta, where he was promoted to Director of Marketing and Merchandising. In 1987, Butler was promoted to President of the newly formed division called Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership (SALO). Butler helped develop the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership model, which revolutionized the rent-to-own industry with larger stores, more selection, and lower prices. The success of the program was exponential and the SALO expansion continues to this day.
