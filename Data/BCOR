ITEM 5.    OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
On July 19, 2002, in accordance with the terms of a Preferred Stock Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between InfoSpace, Inc. (the "Company") and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent"), the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right (a "Right") to purchase one one-thousandth share of the Company's Series C Participating Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred") for each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Shares"), of the Company. The dividend is payable on August 9, 2002 (the "Record Date") to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Preferred at an exercise price of $5.50 (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment.
 
The following summary of the principal terms of the Rights Agreement is a general description only and is subject to the detailed terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement. A copy of the Rights Agreement is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.4 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Rights Evidenced by Common Shares Certificates
 
The Rights will not be exercisable until the Distribution Date (defined below). Certificates for the Rights ("Rights Certificates") will not be sent to stockholders and the Rights will attach to and trade only together with the Common Shares. Accordingly, Common Shares certificates outstanding on the Record Date will evidence the Rights related thereto, and Common Shares certificates issued after the Record Date will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender or transfer of any certificates for Common Shares, outstanding as of the Record Date, even without notation or a copy of the Summary of Rights being attached thereto, also will constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate.
 
Distribution Date
 
The Rights will be separate from the Common Shares; Rights Certificates will be issued, and the Rights will become exercisable upon the earlier of (a) the tenth day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company's Board of Directors) after a person or group of affiliated or associated persons ("Acquiring Person") has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding (or, with respect to Naveen Jain, 25% of more of the Common Shares then outstanding), and (b) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company's Board of Directors) after a person or group announces a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares. The earlier of such dates is referred to as the "Distribution Date."
 
Issuance of Rights Certificates; Expiration of Rights
 
As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, a Rights Certificate will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Rights Certificate alone will evidence the Rights from and after the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on the earliest of (i) August 9, 2012, (the "Final Expiration Date") and (ii) the redemption or exchange of the Rights as described below.
 
Initial Exercise of the Rights
 
Following the Distribution Date, and until one of the further events described below, holders of the Rights will be entitled to receive, upon exercise and the payment of the Purchase Price, one one-thousandth share of the Series C Preferred. In the event that the Company does not have sufficient Series C Preferred available for all Rights to be exercised, or the Board decides that such action is necessary and not contrary to the interests of Rights holders, the Company may instead substitute cash, assets or other securities for the Series C Preferred for which the Rights would have been exercisable under this provision or as described below.
Right to Buy Company Common Shares
 
Unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in the event that an Acquiring Person obtains 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares (or, with respect to Naveen Jain, 25% or more of the Company's Common Shares), then each holder of a Right which has not theretofore been exercised (other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person, which will thereafter be void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, Common Shares having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price. Rights are not exercisable following the occurrence of an event as described above until such time as the Rights are no longer redeemable by the Company as set forth below.
 
Right to Buy Acquiring Company Shares
 
Similarly, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in the event that, after an Acquiring Person obtains 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares (or, with respect to Naveen Jain, 25% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Shares), (i) the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, or (ii) 50% or more of the Company's consolidated assets or earning power are sold (other than in transactions in the ordinary course of business), proper provision must be made so that each holder of a Right which has not theretofore been exercised (other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person, which will thereafter be void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price.
 
Exchange Provision
 
At any time after an Acquiring Person obtains 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares (or, with respect Naveen Jain, 25% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Shares) and prior to the acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by the Acquiring Person), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right.
 
Redemption
 
At any time on or prior to the Close of Business on the earlier of (i) the fifth day following the attainment of 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares by an Acquiring Person (or 25% with respect to Naveen Jain) (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company's Board of Directors and publicly announced by the Company), and (ii) the Final Expiration Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right.
 
Adjustments to Prevent Dilution
 
The Purchase Price payable, the number of Rights, and the number of shares of Series C Preferred or Common Shares or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time in connection with the dilutive issuances by the Company as set forth in the Rights Agreement. With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price.
 
Cash Paid Instead of Issuing Fractional Shares
 
No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon exercise of a Right and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Common Shares on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise.
 
No Stockholders' Rights Prior to Exercise
 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company (other than any rights resulting from such holder's ownership of Common Shares), including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
Amendment of Rights Agreement
 
The terms of the Rights and the Rights Agreement may be amended in any respect without the consent of the Rights holders on or prior to the Distribution Date; thereafter, the terms of the Rights and the Rights Agreement may be amended without the consent of the Rights holders in order to cure any ambiguities or to make changes which do not adversely affect the interests of Rights holders (other than the Acquiring Person).
 
Rights and Preferences of the Series C Preferred
 
Each one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Preferred has rights and preferences substantially equivalent to those of one Common Share.
 
No Voting Rights
 
Rights will not have any voting rights.
 
Certain Anti-Takeover Effects
 
The Rights approved by the Board of Directors are designed to protect and maximize the value of the outstanding equity interests in the Company in the event of an unsolicited attempt by an acquirer to take over the Company in a manner or on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. Takeover attempts frequently include coercive tactics to deprive the Company's Board of Directors and its stockholders of any real opportunity to determine the destiny of the Company. The Rights have been declared by the Board in order to deter such tactics, including a gradual accumulation of shares in the open market of 15% or greater position to be followed by a merger or a partial or two-tier tender offer that does not treat all stockholders equally. These tactics unfairly pressure stockholders, squeeze them out of their investment without giving them any real choice and deprive them of the full value of their shares.
 
The Rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company and will not do so. Subject to the restrictions described above, the Rights may be redeemed by the Company at $0.001 per Right at any time prior to the Distribution Date. Accordingly, the Rights should not interfere with any merger or business combination approved by the Board of Directors.
 
However, the Rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the Company deemed undesirable by the Board of Directors. The Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms or in a manner not approved by the Company's Board of Directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon the negation, purchase or redemption of the Rights.
 
Issuance of the Rights does not in any way weaken the financial strength of the Company or interfere with its business plans. The issuance of the Rights themselves has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, should not be taxable to the Company or to its stockholders, and will not change the way in which the Company's shares are presently traded. The Company's Board of Directors believes that the Rights represent a sound and reasonable means of addressing the complex issues of corporate policy created by the current takeover environment.

Issuance of Rights Certificates
 
(a)    Until the Distribution Date, (i) the Rights will be evidenced (subject to the provisions of Sections 3(b) and 3(c) hereof) by the certificates for Common Shares registered in the names of the holders thereof (which certificates shall also be deemed to be Rights Certificates) and not by separate Rights Certificates and (ii) Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Shares. Until the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date, the surrender for transfer of certificates for Common Shares shall also constitute the surrender for transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Company will promptly notify the Rights Agent thereof, and prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign, and the Company will send or cause to be sent (and the Rights Agent will, if requested and provided with all necessary information, send) by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the Close of Business on the Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company, a Rights Certificate evidencing one Right for each Common Share so held, subject to adjustment as provided herein. In the event that an adjustment in the number of Rights per Common Share has been made pursuant to Section 11 hereof, then at the time of distribution of the Rights Certificates, the Company shall make the necessary and appropriate rounding adjustments (in accordance with Section 14(a) hereof) so that Rights Certificates representing only whole numbers of Rights are distributed and cash is paid in lieu of any fractional Rights. As of and after the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such Rights Certificates and may be transferred by the transfer of the Rights Certificates as permitted hereby, separately and apart from any transfer of Common Shares, and the holders of such Rights Certificates as listed in the records of the Company or any transfer agent or registrar for the Rights shall be the record holders thereof.
 
(b)    On the Record Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Company will send a copy of the Summary of Rights by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the Close of Business on the Record Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company's transfer agent and registrar. With respect to certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof together with the Summary of Rights.
 
(c)    Unless the Board of Directors by resolution adopted at or before the time of the issuance of any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date (or, in certain circumstances provided in Section 22 hereof, after the Distribution Date) specifies to the contrary, Rights shall be issued in respect of all Common Shares that are so issued, and Certificates representing such Common Shares shall also be deemed to be certificates for Rights, and shall bear the following legend:
 
THIS CERTIFICATE ALSO EVIDENCES AND ENTITLES THE HOLDER HEREOF TO CERTAIN RIGHTS AS SET FORTH IN A RIGHTS AGREEMENT BETWEEN INFOSPACE, INC.

THE COMPANY WILL MAIL TO THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE A COPY OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT WITHOUT CHARGE AFTER RECEIPT OF A WRITTEN REQUEST THEREFOR. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT, RIGHTS ISSUED TO, OR HELD BY, ANY PERSON WHO IS, WAS OR BECOMES AN ACQUIRING PERSON OR ANY AFFILIATE OR ASSOCIATE THEREOF (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT), WHETHER CURRENTLY HELD BY OR ON BEHALF OF SUCH PERSON OR BY ANY SUBSEQUENT HOLDER, MAY BECOME NULL AND VOID.
 
With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, until the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates shall be evidenced by such certificates alone, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby.
 
(d)    In the event that the Company purchases or acquires any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common Shares shall be deemed canceled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the Common Shares which are no longer outstanding.

In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Rights Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Rights Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the Company with the same force and effect as though the person

(b)    If the Company shall hereafter list any of its Preferred Shares on a national securities exchange, then so long as the Preferred Shares (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, Common Shares and/or other securities) issuable and deliverable upon exercise of the Rights may be listed on such exchange, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable (but only to the extent that the Company's Board of Directors determines that it is reasonably likely that the Rights will be exercised), all shares reserved for such issuance to be listed on such exchange upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.
 
(c)    The Company shall use its best efforts to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the earliest date after the first occurrence of a Triggering Event in which the consideration to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of the Rights is described in Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, or as soon as is required by law following the Distribution Date, as the case may be, a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing, and (iii) cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (B) the Expiration Date. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days after the date set forth in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 9(c), the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file such registration statement and permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating, and notify the Rights Agent, that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement and notification to the Rights Agent at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. The Company will also take such action as may be appropriate under, or to ensure compliance with, the securities or "blue sky" laws of the various states in connection with the
exercisability of the Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction, unless the requisite qualification in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained, or an exemption therefrom shall be available, and until a registration statement has been declared and remains effective.
 
(d)    The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such securities (subject to payment of the Exercise Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable.
 
(e)    The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all taxes and governmental charges which may be payable in respect of the original issuance or delivery of the Rights Certificates or of any Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates to a person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates or depository receipts for the Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Rights Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or to deliver any certificates or depository receipts for Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax or charge shall have been paid (any such tax or charge being payable by the holder of such Rights Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's satisfaction that no such tax or charge is due.
 
Section 10.    .    Each Person in whose name any certificate for a number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or other securities of the Company) is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Total Exercise Price with respect to which the Rights have been exercised (and any applicable taxes and charges) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the transfer books of the Company are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Rights Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of Preferred Shares (or other securities of the Company) for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.

(b)    In case the Company shall, at any time after the date of this Agreement, fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Shares entitling such holders (for a period expiring within forty-five (45) calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares or Equivalent Shares or securities convertible into Preferred Shares or Equivalent Shares at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Preferred Shares or Equivalent Shares) less than the then Current Per Share Market Price of the Preferred Shares or Equivalent Shares on such record date, then, in each such case, the Exercise Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Preferred Shares and Equivalent Shares (if any) outstanding on such record date, plus the number of Preferred Shares or Equivalent Shares, as the case may be, which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Preferred Shares or Equivalent Shares, as the case may be, to be offered or issued (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities to be offered or issued) would purchase at such current market price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of Preferred Shares and Equivalent Shares (if any) outstanding on such record date, plus the number of additional Preferred Shares or Equivalent Shares, as the case may be, to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible); , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding and conclusive on the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights for all purposes. Preferred Shares and Equivalent Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

(c)    In case the Company shall, at any time after the date of this Agreement, fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Preferred Shares or of any class or series of Equivalent Shares (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend, if any, or a dividend payable in Preferred Shares) or subscription rights, options or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b)), then, in each such case, the Exercise Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Per Share Market Price of a Preferred Share or an Equivalent Share on such record date, less the fair market value per Preferred Share or Equivalent Share (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding and conclusive on
the Rights Agent for all purposes) of the portion of the cash, assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to a Preferred Share or Equivalent Share, as the case may be, and the denominator of which shall be such Current Per Share Market Price of a Preferred Share or Equivalent Share on such record date; , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would have been in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
provided
however
 
(d)    Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1.0%) of the Exercise Price; , , that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(d) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest ten-thousandth (0.0001) of a Common Share or other share or one hundred-thousandth (0.00001) of a Preferred Share, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(d), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three (3) years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii) the Expiration Date.
provided
however
 
(e)    If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) or Section 13(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock other than Preferred Shares, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right and, if required, the Exercise Price thereof, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Shares contained in Sections 11(a), 11(b), 11(c), 11(d), 11(f), 11(g), 11(h), 11(i), 11(j), 11(k) and 11(l), and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 with respect to the Preferred Shares shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
 
(f)    All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Exercise Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Exercise Price, the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
 
(g)    Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(h), upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price as a result of the calculations made in Section 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Exercise Price, that number of Preferred Shares (calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth (0.00001) of a share) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of Preferred Shares covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment, by (y) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Exercise Price, and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Exercise Price.
(h)    The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Exercise Price as a result of the calculations made in Section 11(b) or (c) to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of Preferred Shares purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth (0.00001)) obtained by dividing the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Exercise Price by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Exercise Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made, and shall promptly give the Rights Agent a copy of such announcement. This record date may be the date on which the Exercise Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if any Rights Certificates have been issued, shall be at least ten days later than the date of the public announcement. If Rights Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(h), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Rights Certificates on such record date Rights Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Rights Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Rights Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. Rights Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Exercise Price) and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Rights Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
 
(i)    Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Exercise Price or the number of Preferred Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Rights Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Exercise Price per one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share and the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share which were expressed in the initial Rights Certificates issued hereunder.
 
(j)    Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Exercise Price below the par or stated value, if any, of the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable shares such number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share at such adjusted Exercise Price.
 
(k)    In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Exercise Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer (and shall give prompt written notice of such election to the Rights Agent) until the occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a
Preferred Share and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Exercise Price in effect prior to such adjustment; , , that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares (fractional or otherwise) upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
provided
however
 
(l)    Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Distribution Date, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Exercise Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any (i) consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred or Common Shares, (ii) issuance wholly for cash of any Preferred or Common Shares at less than the current market price, (iii) issuance wholly for cash of Preferred or Common Shares or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred or Common Shares, (iv) stock dividends or (v) issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 11, hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred or Common Shares shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
 
(m)    The Company covenants and agrees that, after the Distribution Date, it will not, except as permitted by Sections 23, 24 or 27 hereof, take (or permit to be taken) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
 
(n)    In the event that the Company shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding Common Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Common Shares (by reverse stock split or otherwise) into a smaller number of Common Shares, or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), then, in each such event, except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a) and Section 7(e) hereof: (1) each Common Share (or shares of capital stock issued in such reclassification of the Common Shares) outstanding immediately following such time shall have associated with it the number of Rights as were associated with one Common Share immediately prior to the occurrence of the event described in clauses (A)-(D) above; (2) the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted so that the Exercise Price thereafter shall equal the result obtained by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such time by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the event described in clauses (A)-(D) above, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event; , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of such Right; and (3) the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or shares of such other capital stock) issuable upon the exercise of each Right outstanding after such event shall equal the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or shares of such other capital stock) as were issuable with respect to one Right immediately prior to such event. Each Common Share that shall become outstanding after an adjustment has been made pursuant to this Section 11(n) shall
provided
however
have associated with it the number of Rights, exercisable at the Exercise Price and for the number of one-thousandths (0.001) of a Preferred Share (or shares of such other capital stock) as one Common Share has associated with it immediately following the adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11(n). If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both this Section 11(n) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(n) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof.
 
Section 12.    .    Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 and/or 13 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts and computations accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Preferred Shares a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Rights Certificate in accordance with Section 26 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the failure of the Company to make such certification or give such notice shall not affect the validity of such adjustment or the force or effect of the requirement for such adjustment. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment contained therein and shall have no duty with respect to and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.

(a)    In the event that, following a Triggering Event, directly or indirectly:
 
(i)  the Company shall consolidate with, or merge with and into, any other Person (other than a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction the principal purpose of which is to change the state of incorporation of the Company and which complies with Section 11(m) hereof);
 
(ii)  any Person shall consolidate with the Company, or merge with and into the Company and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger and, in connection with such merger, all or part of the Common Shares shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other Person (or the Company); or
 
(iii)  the Company shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions, assets or earning power aggregating 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons (other than the Company or one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries in one or more transactions, each of which individually (and together) complies with Section 11(m) hereof),
 
then, concurrent with and in each such case,
 
(A)  each holder of a Right (except as provided in Section 7(e) hereof) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal to the Total Exercise Price applicable immediately prior to the occurrence of the Section 13 Event in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such number of validly authorized and issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and freely tradable Common Shares of the Principal Party (as hereinafter defined), free of any liens, encumbrances, rights of first refusal or other adverse claims, as shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing such Total Exercise Price by an amount equal to 50% of the Current Per Share Market Price of the Common Shares of such Principal Party on the date of consummation of such Section 13 Event, , , that the Exercise Price and the number of Common Shares of such Principal Party so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with Section 11(e) hereof;
provided
however
 
(B)  such Principal Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such Section 13 Event, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement;
 
(C)  the term "Company" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party, it being specifically intended that the provisions of Section 11 hereof shall apply only to such Principal Party following the first occurrence of a Section 13 Event;
 
(D)  such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its Common Shares) in connection with the consummation of any such transaction as may be necessary to ensure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to its Common Shares thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights; and
 
(E)  upon the subsequent occurrence of any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets or other extraordinary transaction in respect of such Principal Party, each holder of a Right shall thereupon be entitled to receive, upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Total Exercise Price as provided in this Section 13(a), such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property which such holder would have been entitled to receive had such holder, at the time of such transaction, owned the Common Shares of the Principal Party receivable upon the exercise of such Right pursuant to this Section 13(a), and such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, reservation of shares of stock) as may be necessary to permit the subsequent exercise of the Rights in accordance with the terms hereof for such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property.
 
(F)  For purposes hereof, the "earning power" of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors on the basis of the operating income of each business operated by the Company and its Subsidiaries during the three fiscal years preceding the date of such determination (or, in the case of any business not operated by the Company or any Subsidiary during three full fiscal years preceding such date, during the period such business was operated by the Company or any Subsidiary).
 
(b)    For purposes of this Agreement, the term shall mean:
"Principal Party"
 
(i)  in the case of any transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 13(a) hereof: (A) the Person that is the issuer of the securities into which the Common Shares are converted in such merger or consolidation, or, if there is more than one such issuer, the issuer the Common Shares of which have the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding,
 
or (B) if no securities are so issued, (x) the Person that is the other party to the merger, if such Person survives said merger, or, if there is more than one such Person, the Person the Common Shares of which have the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding or (y) if the Person that is the other party to the merger does no survive the merger, the Person that does survive the merger (including the Company if it survives) or (z) the Person resulting from the consolidation; and
 
(ii)  in the case of any transaction described in clause (iii) of Section 13(a) hereof, the Person that is the party receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to such transaction or transactions, or, if more than one Person that is a party to such transaction or transactions receives the same portion of the assets or earning power so transferred and each such portion would, were it not for the other equal portions, constitute the greatest portion of the assets or earning power so transferred, or if the Person receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power cannot be determined, whichever of such Persons is the issuer of Common Shares having the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding; provided that in any such case described in the foregoing clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii), if the Common Shares of such Person are not at such time or have not been continuously over the preceding 12-month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, then (1) if such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another Person the Common Shares of which are and have been so registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to such other Person, or (2) if such Person is a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of more than one Person, the Common Shares of which are and have been so registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of Common Shares having the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding, or (3) if such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, by a joint venture formed by two or more Persons that are not owned, directly or indirectly by the same Person, the rules set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above shall apply to each of the owners having an interest in the venture as if the Person owned by the joint venture was a Subsidiary of both or all of such joint ventures, and the Principal Party in each such case shall bear the obligations set forth in this Section 13 in the same ration as its interest in such Person bears to the total of such interests.
 
(c)    The Company shall not consummate any Section 13 Event unless the Principal Party shall have a sufficient number of authorized Common Shares that have not been issued or reserved for issuance to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with this Section 13 and unless prior thereto the Company and such issuer shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement confirming that such Principal Party shall, upon consummation of such Section 13 Event, assume this Agreement in accordance with Sections 13(a) and 13(b) hereof, that all rights of first refusal or preemptive rights in respect of the issuance of Common Shares of such Principal Party upon exercise of outstanding Rights have been waived, that there are no rights, warrants, instruments or securities outstanding or any agreements or arrangements which, as a result of the consummation of such transaction, would eliminate or substantially diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights and that such transaction shall not result in a default by such Principal Party under this Agreement, and further providing that, as soon as practicable after the date of such Section 13 Event, such Principal Party will:
 
(i)  prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as
practicable after such filing and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the Expiration Date, and similarly comply with applicable state securities laws;
 
(ii)  use its best efforts to list (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on a national securities exchange or to meet the eligibility requirements for quotation on Nasdaq and list (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on Nasdaq; and
 
(iii)  deliver to holders of the Rights historical financial statements for such Principal Party which comply in all respects with the requirements for registration on Form 10 (or any successor form) under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event that at any time after the occurrence of a Triggering Event some or all of the Rights shall not have been exercised at the time of a transaction described in this Section 13, the Rights which have not theretofore been exercised shall thereafter be exercisable in the manner described in Section 13(a) (without taking into account any prior adjustment required by Section 11(a)(ii)).
 
(d)    In case the "Principal Party" for purposes of Section 13(b) hereof has provision in any of its authorized securities or in its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other instrument governing its corporate affairs, which provision would have the effect of (i) causing such Principal Party to issue (other than to holders of Rights pursuant to Section 13 hereof), in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of a Section 13 Event, Common Shares or Equivalent Shares of such Principal Party at less than the then Current Per Share Market Price thereof or securities exercisable for, or convertible into, Common Shares or Equivalent Shares of such Principal Party at less than such then Current Per Share Market Price, or (ii) providing for any special payment, tax or similar provision in connection with the issuance of the Common Shares of such Principal Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, then, in such event, the Company hereby agrees with each holder of Rights that it shall not consummate any such transaction unless prior thereto the Company and such Principal Party shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing that the provision in question of such Principal Party shall have been canceled, waived or amended, or that the authorized securities shall be redeemed, so that the applicable provision will have no effect in connection with or as a consequence of, the consummation of the proposed transaction.
 
(e)    The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after the Distribution Date, effect or permit to occur any Section 13 Event, if (i) at the time or immediately after such Section 13 Event there are any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding or agreements in effect which would substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights, (ii) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such Section 13 Event, the shareholders of the Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the "Principal Party" for purposes of Section 13(b) hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates or Associates or (iii) the form or nature of organization of the Principal Party would preclude or limit the exercisability of the Rights.
 
(f)    The provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to successive mergers or consolidations or sales or other transfers.
 
Section 14.    .
Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares
 
(a)    The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Rights Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable, as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1(j) hereof.
 
(b)    The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Preferred Shares (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share). Interests in fractions of Preferred Shares in integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depository receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depository selected by it; , that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depository receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred Shares represented by such depository receipts. In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Rights Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a Preferred Share. For purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a Preferred Share shall be equal to the product of (x) one thousandth (0.001) multiplied by (y) the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1(j) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
provided
 
(c)    The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares upon the exercise or exchange of Rights. In lieu of such fractional Common Shares, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Rights Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a Common Share. For purposes of this Section 14(c), the current market value of a Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1(j) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
 
(d)    The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his or her right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth (0.001) of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of a Right.
 
(e)    Whenever a payment for fractional Rights or fractional shares is to be made by the Rights Agent, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare and deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the facts related to such payments and the prices and/or formulas utilized in calculating such payments, and (ii) provide sufficient monies to the Rights Agent in the form of fully collected funds to make such payments. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying upon such a certificate and shall have no duty with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any payment for fractional Rights or fractional shares under any Section of this Agreement relating to the payment of fractional Rights or fractional shares unless and until the Rights Agent shall have received such a certificate and sufficient monies.
 
Section 15.    .    All rights of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent hereunder, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Rights Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the Common Shares); and any registered holder of any Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), may, in his or her own behalf and for his or her own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his or her right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Rights Certificate in the manner provided in such Rights Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.

(b)    after the Distribution Date, the Rights Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purposes, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer and with the appropriate forms and certificates fully executed; and
 
(c)    subject to Sections 6(a) and 7(f) hereof, the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name the Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated Common Shares certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Rights Certificates or the associated Common Shares certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
Section 17.    .    No holder, as such, of any Rights Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose to be the holder of the Preferred Shares or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Rights Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Rights Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as specifically provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by such Rights Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof.

The Rights Agent undertakes only the duties and obligations expressly imposed by this Agreement (and no implied duties and obligations) upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Rights Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Duties of Rights Agent

(c)    The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company, and any other Person only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (as determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Rights Agent be liable for special, punitive, indirect, consequential or incidental loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage. Any liability of the Rights Agent under this Agreement will be limited to the amount of fees paid by the Company to the Rights Agent.
 
(d)    The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Rights Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
 
(e)    The Rights Agent shall not have any liability for, nor be under any responsibility or have any liability in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights, a transfer to an Acquiring Person or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Sections 3, 11, 13, 23 or 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Rights Certificates after receipt by the Rights Agent of a certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12 describing such change or adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any Preferred Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Rights Certificate or as to whether any Preferred Shares will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
(f)    The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
 
(g)    The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company, and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and such instructions shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent, and the Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may,
at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five (5) Business Days after the date on which any officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken, suffered or omitted.
 
(h)    The Rights Agent and any shareholder, affiliate, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other Person.
 
(i)    The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself (through its directors, officers and employees) or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company or any other Person resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (each as determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction) in the selection and continued employment thereof.
 
(j)    No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if it believes that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(k)    If, with respect to any Rights Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate attached to the form of assignment or form of election to purchase, as the case may be, has either not been completed or indicates an affirmative response to clause 1 and/or 2 thereof, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Company.

Exchange
 
(a)    Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, and subject to subsection 24(c) below, the Company may, at its option, by action of its Board of Directors, at any time after the occurrence of a Triggering Event, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) hereof) for Common Shares at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such Subsidiary, or any Person organized, appointed or established for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.

For purposes of this Section 24(c) only, the Current Value shall mean the product of the Current Per Share Market Price of Common Shares on the date of the occurrence of the event described above in subparagraph (a), multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which the Right otherwise would be exchangeable if there were sufficient shares available. To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 24(c), the Board of Directors may temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights for a period of up to sixty (60) days following the date on which the event described in Section 24(a) shall have occurred, in order to seek any authorization of additional Common Shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to the above provision and to determine the value thereof.

(d)    The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares.

(e)    The Company may, at its option, by majority vote of its Board of Directors, at any time before any Person has become an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding Rights for rights of substantially equivalent value, as determined reasonably and with good faith by the Board of Directors based upon the advice of one or more nationally recognized investment banking firms.
 
(f)    Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection 24(e) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of rights in exchange therefor as has been determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with subsection 24(e) above. The Company shall give public notice of any such exchange (with prompt written notice thereof to the Rights Agent); , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange.

as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
 
(c)    The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (a) of this Section V, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
.    Any shares of Series C Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein and in the Certificate of Incorporation, as then amended.

.    The Certificate of Incorporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preference or special rights of the Series C Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series.
XI.
    Amendment
 
.    Series C Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series C Participating Preferred Stock.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP), a provider of wireless and Internet software and application services, today announced that its board of directors has adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (July 22, 2002)
 
Under the plan, the Company will issue a dividend of one right for each share of its common stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 9, 2002.
 
The Stockholder Rights Plan is designed to guard against partial tender offers and other coercive tactics to gain control of the company without offering a fair and adequate price and terms to all of the Company's stockholders. The plan was not adopted in response to any efforts to acquire the Company, and the Company is not aware of any such efforts.
 
Each right will initially entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of the Company's preferred stock for $5.50. However, the rights are not immediately exercisable and will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events. If a person or group acquires, or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in the acquisition of 15% percent or more of the Company's common stock while the Stockholder Rights Plan remains in place (or, with respect to Naveen Jain, 25% or more of the Company's common stock), then, unless the rights are redeemed by the Company for $0.001 per right, the rights will become exercisable by all rights holders except the acquiring person or group for shares of InfoSpace or shares of the third party acquirer, in each case having a value of twice the right's then-current exercise price. Further details of the plan are outlined in a letter that will be mailed to stockholders of record as of the record date.

I will assign to InfoSpace or its designee all right, title and interest in and to any and all Inventions full title to which may be required to be in the United States by any contract between InfoSpace and the United States or any of its agencies.
 
4.    I have attached hereto a list, Exhibit A, describing all Inventions belonging to me and made by me prior to my employment at InfoSpace that I wish to have excluded from this agreement. If no such list is attached, I represent that there are no such Inventions. If in the course of my employment at InfoSpace, I use in or incorporate into an InfoSpace product, process, or machine, an Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest that is not on Exhibit A and is related (1) directly to the business of InfoSpace or (2) to the actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of InfoSpace, InfoSpace is hereby granted and shall have a non-exclusive royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide license to make, have made, use and sell that Invention without restriction as to the extent of my ownership or interest.

I will testify at InfoSpace's request and expense in any interference, litigation, or other legal proceeding that may arise during or after my employment.
 
6.    I recognize that InfoSpace has received and will receive confidential and proprietary information from third parties subject to a duty on InfoSpace's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. During the term of my employment and thereafter I owe InfoSpace and such
third parties a duty not to disclose such confidential or proprietary information to anyone except as necessary in carrying out my work for InfoSpace and consistent with InfoSpace's agreement with such third party. I will not use such information for the benefit of anyone other than InfoSpace or such third party, or in any manner inconsistent with any agreement between InfoSpace and such third party of which I am made aware.
 
7.    During my employment at InfoSpace I will not improperly use or disclose any confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of my former or current employers, principals, partners, co-ventures, clients, customers, or suppliers, or the vendors or customers of such persons or entities or their vendors or customers unless such persons or entities have given verbal consent. I will not violate any non-disclosure or proprietary rights agreement I might have signed in connection with any such person or entity.
 
8.    I acknowledge that my employment will be of indefinite duration and that either InfoSpace or I will be free to terminate this employment relationship at will at any time with or without cause. I also acknowledge that any representations to the contrary are unauthorized and void, unless contained in a formal written employment contract signed by an officer of InfoSpace. I further acknowledge that the terms and conditions of this agreement shall survive termination of my employment.
 
9.    At the time I leave the employ of InfoSpace or at InfoSpace's request, I will return to InfoSpace all papers, drawings, notes, memoranda, manuals, specifications, designs, devices, documents, diskettes and tapes, and any other material on any media containing or disclosing any confidential or proprietary technical or business information. I will also return any keys, pass cards, identification cards or any other property belonging to InfoSpace.
 
10.    For a period of one year after termination of my employment, I will not accept employment or engage in any activities directly competitive with or substantially similar to the business (as defined in the first paragraph) or with the actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of InfoSpace as of my termination date.
 
11.    While employed at InfoSpace and for a period of one year from the termination of my employment I will not induce or attempt to influence directly or indirectly any employee of InfoSpace to terminate his/her employment with InfoSpace or to work for me or any other person or entity.
 
12.    I agree to inform any new employer, prior to accepting any such new employment, of the existence and terms of this agreement and to provide such new employer with a copy of this agreement. I also agree that InfoSpace may notify any person, company or other business entity which InfoSpace believes has hired or may hire me of the existence and terms of this agreement; InfoSpace may also furnish a copy of this agreement to any such person, company or other business entity.

including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions, without the necessity of posting bond or security.
 
14.    I acknowledge that I have had a full opportunity to read this agreement before signing it. I confirm that I understand its terms and believe them to be reasonable, and I agree that InfoSpace's offer of employment or continued employment is sufficient consideration for this agreement.
 
15.    If court proceedings are required to enforce any provision or to remedy any breach of this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable and necessary expenses of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

The employment relationship for most InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace") employees is terminable "at will," meaning that they are free to resign at any time for any reason and InfoSpace is also free to end the employment relationship at any time for any reason. Even so, disputes about employment and related claims sometimes arise. InfoSpace is committed to resolving any such disputes and claims efficiently and effectively, while preserving due process safeguards. This commitment includes use of binding arbitration as the means of final resolution of all such disputes and claims to the maximum extent permitted by state and federal law. By this agreement ("Agreement"), InfoSpace and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns (together the "Company") agree that they will arbitrate covered disputes and claims subject to the provisions contained herein.
 
In consideration for my employment with the Company, the compensation and benefits I receive based on that employment and the Company's mutual agreement for arbitration, except as provided below, I, , hereby agree that any dispute and/or claim between the Company and me that underlies, relates to and/or results from my employment relationship with the Company or the termination of that relationship and that cannot be otherwise resolved will be submitted to final, binding arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law in accordance with the of the American Arbitration Association that are then in effect. (Copies of the current rules are available from the Human Resources department.) This Agreement also governs any claims that I may have against the Company's officers, directors, employees, agents and shareholders that underlie, relate to and/or result from my employment relationship or service with the Company or the termination of that relationship or service. However, specifically excluded are claims for the following: (i) Any claims of any kind arising after the date of execution of the Release defined in my Employment Agreement with the Company; (ii) Any claims for libel, slander or defamation; (iii) Any claims arising solely by virtue of my status as a shareholder; or (iv) Any claims for indemnification pursuant to the Company bylaws or certificate of incorporation, or pursuant to applicable law.
                                
National Rules for
the Resolution of Employment Disputes
 
I understand that, pursuant to this Agreement, I forego and waive the right to take any covered dispute or claim to civil litigation in court. I understand that this Agreement governs any claim I have that underlies, relates to and/or results from my employment relationship with the Company or the termination of that relationship, including, but not limited to, claims of wrongful discharge, infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, breach of any covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and claims of retaliation and/or discrimination in violation of any local, state or federal law. Examples of such laws include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; RCW Chapter 49.60, and all amendments to each such Act as well
as the regulations issued thereunder. This Agreement does not affect my right to pursue worker's compensation or unemployment compensation benefits for which I may be eligible in accordance with state law, nor does it affect my right to file and/or to cooperate in the investigation of an administrative charge of discrimination.
 
I understand that I may seek in arbitration any remedy or award that would be available to me through civil litigation and the arbitrator has authority to grant any such remedy or award. I agree that such remedies include monetary damages but do not include reinstatement unless authorized by statute.
 
I understand that either I or the Company may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this Agreement and without abridgement of the powers of the arbitrator. In any matter that is presented to an arbitrator under this Agreement, I agree that the location of the arbitration hearing(s) will be in King County, Washington, unless another location is mutually agreed upon.
 
I enter into this Agreement freely and voluntarily in consideration for my employment with the Company, the compensation and benefits I receive based on that employment and the Company's mutual agreement for arbitration.
 
This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter herein and any representations, promises, or conditions in connection therein not in writing and signed by both parties shall not be binding upon either party. If any provision of this Agreement is declared excessively broad, it shall be construed so as to afford the Company the maximum protection permissible by law. If any provision of this Agreement is void or so declared, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement, which shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.
 
 
 
 
Agreed to and accepted on behalf of the Company:
 
 
 
This release of claims ("Release" or "Agreement") is entered into by and between James F. Voelker ("Employee") and InfoSpace, Inc.("Company") this day of , 20.
            
            
            
 
In consideration of the severance benefits which are being given to him specifically in exchange for this release as a result of negotiations between himself and the Company which resulted in the Employment Agreement between himself and the Company dated December , 2003, and pursuant to the terms of such Employment Agreement, Employee, on behalf of himself, his marital community, and their heirs, successors and assigns, release and discharge the Company, and its predecessor organizations, their employee benefit plans and/or their current or former directors, officers, agents, employees and attorneys, any and each of their successors and assigns and predecessors ("Released Parties"), from any and all claims, charges, causes of action and damages (including attorneys' fees and costs actually incurred), known and unknown ("Claims"), relating to Employee's employment with the Company, or the termination of such employment, as well as any claims relating to equity grants, arising prior to the effective date of this Agreement.
            
 
It is understood and agreed that this Release is not intended to and does not waive Employee's rights: (a) to indemnification pursuant to any applicable provision of the Company Bylaws or Certificate of Incorporation, or pursuant to applicable law; or (b) to vested benefits or payments specifically to be provided to Employee under the Agreement or any Company employee benefit plans; or (c) respecting any claims which Employee may have solely by virtue of his status as a shareholder of the Company; or (d) respecting any claims by Employee for defamation, libel or slander;
 
Subject to the preceding paragraph, this Release specifically includes, but is not limited to, rights and claims under the local, state or federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, including the Civil Rights Acts, The Americans with Disabilities Act, The Washington Law Against Discrimination, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as well as any other state or federal laws or common law contract, public policy or tort theories relating to employment, the termination of employment, or personal injury, including without limitation all claims for breach of contract, loss of consortium, infliction of emotional distress, additional compensation, back pay or benefits (other than as provided for in this Agreement).
 
Employee understands and acknowledges the significance of this Agreement and acknowledges that this Agreement is voluntary and has not been given as a result of any coercion.
 
Employee acknowledges that he is waiving and releasing any rights he may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ("ADEA") and that this waiver and release is knowing and voluntary. Employee and the Company agree that this waiver and release do not apply to any rights or claims that may arise under ADEA after the effective date of this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that the consideration given for this waiver and release Agreement is in addition to anything of value to which Employee was already entitled. Employee further acknowledges that he has been advised by this writing that
 
(a) he should consult with an attorney to executing this Agreement;
prior
 
(b) he has up to twenty-one (21) days within which to consider this Agreement;
 
(c) he has seven (7) days following his/her execution of this Agreement to revoke this Agreement;

Employee represents that he is not aware of any claim by him other than the claims that are released by (or excluded from) this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that he has been advised by legal counsel and is familiar with the principle that a general release may not extend to claims which the releasor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the releasee. Employee, being aware of said principle, agrees to expressly waive any rights he may have to that effect, as well as under any other statute or common law principles of similar effect.

"We are pleased with our fourth quarter results, as we reported sequential revenue growth and significant cost reductions."
 
In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), net loss for the fourth quarter was $64 million, or a loss of $2.07 per basic share. The principal difference between GAAP net loss and pro forma net income for the quarter was the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of $60.9 million. This charge is based on a preliminary independent valuation report. For the full year, the GAAP net loss was $344.8 million, or a loss of $11.16 per basic share, which included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal of $206.6 million under the adoption of SFAS 142, the accounting standard related to goodwill. For 2001 InfoSpace reported a GAAP loss of $102 million in the fourth quarter and a GAAP loss of $502.1 million for the full year.
 
Pro forma net income for the fourth quarter was $1.7 million, which included $4.1 million of non-cash depreciation. Pro forma EPS (earnings per share) was $0.05 per fully diluted share. EPS information within this press release reflects the 1-for-10 reverse stock split approved by InfoSpace's shareholders on September 12, 2002. For the full year pro forma net loss was $11.8 million, or a loss of $0.38 cents per basic share post split. For the fourth quarter 2001, InfoSpace reported a pro forma net loss of $5.5 million, including non-cash depreciation of $5.2 million, or a loss of $0.18 cents per share post split. For the full year 2001 the Company reported a pro forma net loss of $20 million or a loss of $0.63 cents per share.

Item 9.
 
On May 1, 2003, InfoSpace announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished to the Commission as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: May 2, 2003
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (May 1, 2003)
 
Revenues for the first quarter of 2003 were $36.6 million, reflecting a $3.5 million (or 10%) increase over the first quarter of 2002. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), net loss for the first quarter of 2003 was $1.3 million, or $0.04 per basic share, versus a net loss of $240.5 million, or $7.88 per basic share, in the first quarter of 2002. GAAP net loss in the first quarter of 2003 included a $4.0 million charge for an IRS tax settlement. GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2002 included a $206.6 million non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding cash held on behalf of Authorize.Net merchants) at the end of the first quarter of 2003 totaled $283.9 million, reflecting an increase of $10.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is due to the sale of certain equity investments in the aggregate amount of $7.8 million and cash generated from operations. The Company had no debt obligations as of the end of the quarter.
 
"We are pleased with our quarterly results," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace. "We are focused on our customers and improving product and service quality to maximize our long term growth and profitability."
 
First Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Segment Information
 
 
 
 
 
 
Payroll Tax Audit (2000)
 
The Company recently reached a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the audit of our payroll tax returns for the year 2000. The audit included a review of tax withholding on stock options exercised by certain former employees. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company will pay $4.0 million, including interest and penalties, and is relieved of any further withholding tax liability with respect to those certain former employees. In previous statements and filings, the Company had estimated the potential liability as being between zero and $18.6 million plus interest and penalties.
 
Outlook
 
As a result of continuing price erosion in the wireless segment, the exiting of certain businesses outside of the Company's three core businesses, seasonality in Internet usage and weak general economic trends, the Company expects to experience a sequential decline in revenue. For the second quarter of 2003, the Company expects revenue to be between $32 million and $34 million. These trends will also negatively affect net income for the second quarter of 2003. Depending on the outcome of business dispositions and potential further refinements and changes to the Company's business strategy, the Company may also incur additional restructuring costs in the future. The Company will not be providing additional forward-looking guidance for 2003.

On July 30, 2003, InfoSpace announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished to the Commission as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (July 30, 2003)
 
Revenues for the second quarter of 2003 were $38.3 million, reflecting a $5.1 million (or 15.2%) increase over the second quarter of 2002. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), net loss for the second quarter of 2003 was $15.0 million, or $0.48 per basic share, versus a net loss of $13.7 million, or $0.45 per basic share in the second quarter of 2002.
 
In the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded net charges of $18.3 million. The Company recorded a restructuring charge of $10.5 million, comprised of employee separation costs of $4.0 million and a charge of $6.5 million related to excess facilities. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $12.6 million as a result of the disposition and impairment of certain equity investments, and recognized a $4.7 million gain from a litigation settlement and other items. For the second quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a net charge of $0.8 million for the settlement of a litigation matter and a reserve on a note receivable.
 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments at the end of the second quarter of 2003 totaled $301.1 million, reflecting an increase of $13.2 million from the first quarter of 2003. The Company had no debt obligations at the end of the quarter.
 
"During the quarter we reorganized the company to sharpen our business focus and further align costs with revenues," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "Each of our three businesses contributed to another quarter of positive free cash-flow."
 
Segment Information
 
During the second quarter of 2003, the Company reorganized around three businesses: Search and Directory, Payment Solutions and Wireless. As announced last quarter, services falling outside of these areas are in the process of being sold or disposed. As a result of this reorganization, the Company has changed its segment reporting to better reflect how it measures the operating performance of the segments.
 
    Search and Directory revenues were $21.4 million in the second quarter of 2003, an increase of $5.2 million or 31.8% from the second quarter of 2002. The revenue increase is primarily due to growth in the number of paid searches and greater revenue per search. Total paid searches during the quarter, including both Search and Directory, were approximately 136 million, generating average revenue per paid search of approximately $0.13. Search and Directory segment income was $11.8 million or 54.9% of revenues for the second quarter of 2003.
 
    Payment Solutions revenues were $6.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, an increase of $1.5 million or 27.9% from the second quarter of 2002. The revenue increase is due to growth in the number of merchants using the Authorize.Net service and an increase in the number of transactions. At the end of the
second quarter, approximately 83,000 active gateway merchants were using the Authorize.Net service, generating an average of approximately $23.40 in monthly revenue per active merchant. Payment Solutions segment income totaled $1.3 million or 19.5% of revenues for the second quarter of 2003.
 
    Wireless revenues were $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2003, a decrease of $0.6 million or 8.3% from the second quarter of 2002. The decrease in revenue is primarily a result of the previously reported loss of a major customer in 2002. Wireless segment income totaled $2.0 million or 29.7% of revenues for the second quarter of 2003.
 
For each segment, the historical financial results for the first quarter of 2002 through the first quarter of 2003 are presented in a manner consistent with the Company's new reporting segments, which required the Company to allocate historical costs to each segment based on the manner in which the Company currently operates. The revised financial information for the new segments was based on management's estimates and assumptions for comparative purposes, is not indicative of how the Company managed its business or operated the segments in the past, and is different than the segment results previously presented. Segment income for each reportable operating segment does not include allocations for general, administrative and other overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other charges and non-operating gains or losses.
 
Outlook
 
As a result of the sale or disposition of certain non-core services, pricing declines in the wireless segment and seasonality in Internet usage during the summer months, the Company expects a sequential decline in revenue. For the third quarter of 2003, the Company expects revenue to be between $32 million and $34 million and a net loss excluding any one-time gains or losses. The Company will not be providing additional forward-looking guidance for 2003.

 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced that it is tightening its strategic focus to two businesses: InfoSpace Search & Directory and InfoSpace Mobile. As part of this sharpened focus, InfoSpace is exploring strategic options for its Payment Solutions division.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (October 20, 2003)
 
"This action indicates the strong potential we see in both the wireless and online search and directory industries," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "While we believe that Payment Solutions is a growing, profitable business, we feel it is in the best interest of our shareholders, customers and employees to focus on fewer opportunities."
 
InfoSpace Payment Solutions enables merchants to authorize, settle and manage electronic transactions via its IP-based payment gateway, Authorize.Net. Authorize.Net connects small and medium-sized businesses to large credit card processors and banking organizations, thereby enabling those businesses to accept electronic payments. Authorize.Net's payment services are sold through an extensive network of reseller partners and leading financial institutions, such as Wells Fargo.
 
"The Payment Solutions team has built a great business with strong revenue growth and margins," said Voelker. "The business will be better served by a strategic partner that can provide it with increased focus and a broader platform for growth."
 
As reflected in the Company's Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2003, Payment Solutions generated $6.6 million in revenue for the three months ended June 30, an increase of $1.5 million or 27.9% from the second quarter of 2002. During the same period, Payment Solutions segment income totaled $1.3 million, or 19.5% of revenues (see the Company's Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of segment income to the consolidated financial statements). At the end of the second quarter, 83,000 active gateway merchants were using the Authorize.Net service.
 
The company has engaged Thomas Weisel Partners to assist in the process.

"With expanded end-user reach and an extensive content library, we can offer compelling marketing and promotional opportunities to content brands and media companies, helping to get their content and applications quickly and easily into as many subscriber hands as possible. Carriers will benefit from expanded capabilities and accelerated availability of applications and content to drive their mobile data revenue streams."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (October 29, 2003)
 
Revenues for the third quarter of 2003 were $38.3 million, reflecting a $4.7 million (or 14.0%) increase over the third quarter of 2002. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), net income for the third quarter of 2003 was $1.6 million, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, versus a net loss of $26.6 million, or $0.87 per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2002.
 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments at the end of the third quarter of 2003 totaled $317.4 million, reflecting an increase of $16.3 million from the second quarter of 2003. The Company had no debt obligations at the end of the quarter.
 
"We are very pleased with our third quarter results, reaching profitability and generating 14% year over year revenue growth," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "These achievements are strong indications of the progress we are making as we build the foundation for long-term sustainable growth."
 
Third Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
 
 
 
 
 
 
Segment Information
 
Search and Directory revenues were $23.8 million in the third quarter of 2003, an increase of $7.9 million or 49.5% from the third quarter of 2002. The revenue increase is primarily due to growth in the number of paid searches and greater revenue per search. Total paid searches during the quarter, including both Search and Directory, were approximately 140 million, generating average revenue per paid search of approximately $0.14. Search and Directory segment income was $12.3 million or 51.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2003.
 
Mobile revenues were $5.7 million in the third quarter of 2003, a decrease of $2.8 million or 33.2% from the third quarter of 2002. The decrease in revenue is primarily a result of the previously reported loss of a major customer in 2002 and a one-time gain in 2002 from the discontinuance of the Company's Brazilian operations. Mobile segment income totaled $0.8 million or 14.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2003.
 
Payment Solutions revenues were $7.0 million in the third quarter of 2003, an increase of $1.7 million or 31.7% from the third quarter of 2002. The revenue increase is primarily due to growth in the number of merchants using the Authorize.Net service and an increase in the number of transactions. At the end of the third quarter, approximately 88,000 active gateway merchants were using the Authorize.Net service, generating an average of approximately $22.80 in monthly revenue per active merchant. Payment Solutions segment income totaled $1.6 million or 23.1% of revenues for the third quarter of 2003.
 
Segment income for each reportable operating segment does not include allocations for general, administrative and other overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other charges and non-operating gains or losses.
 
Other Items
 
In the third quarter of 2003, the Company took a $1.2 million intangible asset impairment charge for certain obsolete technology. Additionally, the Company recorded other net charges of $1.5 million. These included a $7.5 million charge for a pending settlement related to the mobile business, partially offset by a gain of $3.9 million related to the disposition of certain non-core services and a gain of $2.2 million for a tax refund.
 
Outlook
 
For the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company expects revenue to be between $36 million and $39 million and net income to be in-line with the third quarter, excluding any one-time gains or losses. This outlook assumes Payment Solutions remains part of continuing operations and the Moviso transaction closes at year-end.

Item 5.
 
On January 14, 2004, InfoSpace, Inc. (the "Company" announced that on January 12, 2004, the King County Superior Court ruled on several summary judgment motions in the lawsuit entitled
InfoSpace, Inc. v. Naveen Jain, et al.
 
The original complaint, filed on March 10, 2003, names as defendants Naveen Jain, the Company's founder, former chief executive officer and chairman, Kevin Marcus, the Company's former chief software architect, and Intelius, Inc., the company they co-founded. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary and contractual duties owed to the Company, wrongfully interfered with the Company's contractual relationships and misappropriated InfoSpace trade secrets and confidential information in order to unfairly compete with the Company.
 
On pre-trial motions submitted by the parties, the Court ruled that Messrs. Jain and Marcus did not violate their non-compete covenants or trade secret law, or interfere with any InfoSpace contractual relationship. In its ruling, the Court acknowledged that a genuine issue of fact was raised on the question of whether Messrs. Jain and Marcus did engage in a business competitive with a business being developed by InfoSpace. However, the Court based its ruling on its finding that the Company had not established an issue of material fact with respect to whether Messrs. Jain and Marcus engaged in unfair competition with InfoSpace through the use of confidential or proprietary information that they had acquired in their prior positions at InfoSpace.
 
In the Company's favor, the Court ruled that Mr. Jain violated his non-compete agreement by not returning Company property. The Court also ruled that InfoSpace's claims that Mr. Jain had breached his fiduciary duty by competing with the Company while he was a director and that he had breached the non-solicitation provision of his agreement with InfoSpace were matters to be considered in a jury trial.
 
The Company intends to appeal the ruling that enforcement of a non-compete requires a showing of the use of confidential and proprietary information.

On January 27, 2004, InfoSpace announced its financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished to the Commission as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2003.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (January 27, 2004)
 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $46.9 million, reflecting a $10.7 million (or 30%) increase over the fourth quarter of 2002. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $9.9 million, or $0.31 per basic and $0.29 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $64.4 million, or $2.09 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Revenues for the full year 2003 were $160.1 million, reflecting a $23.9 million (or 18%) increase over the full year 2002. In accordance with GAAP, net loss for 2003 was $6.3 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, versus a net loss of $345.3 million, or $11.26 per basic and diluted share in 2002.
 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments at December 31, 2003 totaled $300.5 million, reflecting an increase of $24.3 million from December 31, 2002. The Company had no debt obligations at the end of the year.
 
"Our strong fourth quarter and full year 2003 results reflect the dedication of our employees during this transition year," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "During 2003, we narrowed our strategic focus, restructured our operations, improved our service offerings and achieved quarterly profitability for the first time since 1999. We will build on this foundation throughout 2004."
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
 
 
 
Segment Information
 
Segment income for each reportable operating segment does not include allocations for general, administrative and other overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other charges and non-operating gains or losses.
 
Search and Directory
 
Search and Directory revenues were $28.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of $9.2 million (or 48%) from the fourth quarter of 2002. The revenue increase is primarily due to growth in the number of paid searches coming from our distribution partners and greater revenue per search. Total paid searches in North America during the quarter, including both Search and Directory, were approximately 155 million, generating average revenue per paid search of approximately $0.15. Search and Directory segment income was $12.5 million or 44% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
For the full year 2003, Search and Directory revenues were $93.9 million, an increase of $25.4 million (or 37%) from full year 2002. Segment income for 2003 was $48.7 million, an increase of 33% from the $36.7 million in Search and Directory segment income reported for 2002.
 
Mobile
 
Mobile revenues were $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of $2.6 million (or 40%) from the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in revenue is primarily a result of revenues attributable to Moviso's operations. Moviso's financial results are consolidated beginning November 27, 2003. Mobile segment income totaled $3.3 million or 36% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
For the full year 2003, Mobile revenues were $27.9 million, a decrease of $1.3 million (or 4%) from the full year 2002. Segment income for 2003 was $6.8 million versus a loss of $2.2 million in 2002.
 
Payment Solutions
 
Payment Solutions revenues were $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of $1.9 million (or 33%) from the fourth quarter of 2002. The revenue increase is primarily due to growth in the number of credit card merchants using the Authorize.Net service and an increase in the number of transactions, in part from the holiday shopping season. At the end of the fourth quarter, approximately 91,000 active gateway merchants were using the Authorize.Net service, generating an average of approximately $24.30 in monthly revenue per active merchant. Payment Solutions segment income totaled $2.8 million or 35% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
For the full year 2003, Payment Solutions revenues were $27.8 million, an increase of $6.7 million (or 31%) from full year 2002. Segment income for 2003 was $6.9 million, an increase of 293% from the $1.8 million in Payment Solutions segment income reported for 2002.
 
Other Items
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a net gain of $3.8 million which included a gain from the sale of certain non-core services and a gain from a research & development tax credit. During the quarter, the Company also recorded $1.2 million of restructuring charges relating to excess facilities and employee separation costs from a workforce reduction.
Outlook
 
The Company's guidance excludes the potential impact of any one-time gains or losses, and includes operating results from Payment Solutions. However, in the fourth quarter of 2003 the Company began exploring strategic alternatives for its Payment Solutions group. This process is ongoing and the timing and outcome are uncertain.

For the first quarter of 2004, the Company expects revenue to be between $44.0 million and $47.0 million and net income to be between $3.0 million and $5.0 million.

On March 1, 2004 InfoSpace, Inc. announced a definitive agreement to sell its Payment Solutions business to Lightbridge, Inc. for $82 million in cash. The transaction is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2004, and is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approval.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
BELLEVUE, Wash.  March 1, 2004  InfoSpace, Inc. (Nasdaq:INSP) today announced a definitive agreement to sell its Payment Solutions business to Lightbridge, Inc. (Nasdaq:LTBG) for $82 million in cash.
 
"We are pleased to have found such a strong partner for our Payment Solutions business," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "This is an excellent outcome for our Payment Solutions customers and employees."
 
"We are excited to begin working with the dynamic Lightbridge organization," said Prakash Kondepudi, executive vice president of InfoSpace Payment Solutions. "Throughout this process we have been impressed with the Lightbridge team and believe they will offer Payment Solutions strong focus and a broad platform for growth."
 
As announced in October of 2003, InfoSpace is tightening its strategic focus to two businesses: Search & Directory and Mobile.
 
"Although Payment Solutions is a growing, profitable business, we feel it is in the best interest of our shareholders, customers and employees to focus on fewer opportunities," said Voelker. "We see strong potential in both the online search and directory and mobile data industries, and will focus our resources toward capitalizing on those opportunities."
 
InfoSpace Payment Solutions, which operates under the brand Authorize.Net, provides IP-based payment solutions that enable merchants to authorize, settle and manage electronic transactions. Authorize.Net is sold through an extensive network of reseller partners and leading financial institutions that offer its industry-leading payment services to their merchant customers. In 2003, Payment Solutions generated $27.8 million in revenue and $6.9 million in segment income (which excludes depreciation, amortization and allocation of certain corporate expenses).
 
The transaction is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2004, and is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approval. Thomas Weisel Partners acted as financial advisor to InfoSpace.

On March 25, 2004, InfoSpace, Inc. and Switchboard Incorporated entered into a definitive agreement for InfoSpace to acquire Switchboard, a leading provider of local online advertising solutions and internet-based yellow pages, for $7.75 per share or approximately $160 million in cash. As of December 31, 2003, Switchboard had approximately $55.9 million in cash and marketable securities and no debt.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) and Switchboard Incorporated (NASDAQ: SWBD) today announced a definitive agreement for InfoSpace to acquire Switchboard, a leading provider of local online advertising solutions and internet-based yellow pages, for $7.75 per share or approximately $160 million in cash. As of December 31, 2003, Switchboard had approximately $55.9 million in cash and marketable securities and no debt.
BELLEVUE, Wash. and WESTBOROUGH, Mass. (March 26, 2004)
 
At closing, the acquisition nearly doubles the Company's online directory traffic and establishes InfoSpace as the leading online directory provider in the United States. According to comScore/MediaMetrix, InfoSpace and Switchboard's combined network of owned and operated sites and distribution partners comprises approximately 23% of total online yellow pages searches.
 
"We are excited to take a defining step in the growing local search and directory opportunity," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "Through this acquisition, we nearly double our share of online directory traffic, gain a proven technology platform and add several new and important partner relationships. Combined, we assume a leadership role in a market growing as fast as web search, and position ourselves to leverage our complementary assets in web search and online directory."
 
"We believe that by combining the respective strengths of our two companies, we can accelerate the migration and adoption of online local advertising," said Dean Polnerow, president and chief executive officer of Switchboard Incorporated. "Today's announcement is a leap forward for the industry, and for those of us who share the vision that online yellow pages is on the fast track to playing a central role in helping local advertisers reach consumers."
 
Yellow pages directories are a primary source of local merchant information for consumers. According to The Kelsey Group, the yellow pages industry generates nearly $15 billion in annual advertising sales in the United States, and is experiencing a migration from print-based consumer searches to online searches. In 2003, the online directory market was approximately $450 million, and is growing rapidly. According to the June 2003 Kelsey Group report titled "Searching for Profits: Yellow Pages and the Challenge of Pay-per-Click", The Kelsey Group projects the number of online yellow pages searches to grow 25% annually and to account for more than 30% of total yellow pages searches by 2006.
 
Switchboard is a leading provider of local online advertising products for merchants, national advertisers and distribution partners, enabled by innovative, consumer-oriented, online yellow and white pages directory technology. Switchboard's technology benefits both consumers and merchants by combining the depth of information found in printed directories with the interactive, real-time nature of the Web. In addition to generating traffic directly through ,
www.switchboard.com
Switchboard licenses its products to Internet portals, traditional yellow pages publishers, and newspaper publishers to enable them to offer local online advertising solutions and yellow and white pages directories under their own brands.
 
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2004, subject to certain conditions including approval by Switchboard shareholders, the shareholders of Switchboard's majority shareholder, ePresence, Inc., and regulatory authorities.
 
Assuming the Switchboard acquisition closes on or near July 1, 2004, InfoSpace anticipates Switchboard will contribute approximately $10 - $12 million in revenue and $4 - $5 million in Search & Directory segment income for the second half of 2004.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Item 12.
 
On April 28, 2004, InfoSpace announced its financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2004. A copy of the press release is furnished to the Commission as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: May 4, 2004
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2004.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (April 28, 2004)
 
Revenues for the first quarter of 2004 were $48.1 million, reflecting a $17.8 million (or 59%) increase over the first quarter of 2003. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2004 was $5.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, versus a net loss from continuing operations of $1.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003.
 
Due to the recent sale of the Payment Solutions business, Payment Solutions is treated as a discontinued operation for the first quarter of 2004 and all prior periods. As a result, Payment Solutions is not included in revenue or operating results but did contribute to first quarter net income as a discontinued operation. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2004 (which includes a gain of $29.0 million from the sale of Payment Solutions) was $36.7 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003. If Payment Solutions had remained part of continuing operations of InfoSpace for the quarter, it would have contributed $8.4 million in revenue and $2.8 million in segment income.
 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments at March 31, 2004 totaled $379.7 million, reflecting an increase of $84.4 million from December 31, 2003. The increase is primarily attributable to the sale of Payment Solutions for $82 million in cash during the quarter. The Company had no debt obligations at the end of the quarter.
 
"Both Search & Directory and Mobile delivered strong results this quarter, driven by dramatic growth in paid searches and mobile media downloads," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "We will continue to invest in these growing markets, both in organic efforts and through acquisition. Recently we agreed to acquire Switchboard, which will nearly double our online directory traffic and establish us as a leading online directory provider in the U.S."
 
First Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
 
 
 
Segment Information
 
Segment income for each reportable operating segment does not include allocations for general, administrative and other overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other charges and non-operating gains or losses.
 
Search & Directory
 
Search & Directory revenues were $33.3 million in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of $12.9 million (or 63%) from the first quarter of 2003. The increase in revenue is primarily due to growth in the number of paid searches coming from our distribution partners. Total paid searches in North America during the quarter, including both Search and Directory, were approximately 173 million, generating average revenue per paid search of approximately $0.16. Search & Directory segment income was $13.8 million or 41.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Mobile
 
Mobile revenues were $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of $8.7 million (or 142%) from the first quarter of 2003. The increase in revenue is a result of revenues attributable to media downloads. Mobile segment income totaled $3.8 million or 25.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Other Items
 
During the quarter, the Company recorded a net charge of $1.0 million relating to restructuring and other costs, and a net gain of $0.4 million related to certain minority investments.
 
Outlook
 
The Company's guidance excludes the potential impact of any one-time gains or losses, and excludes operating results from Payment Solutions.
 
Second Quarter 2004 Outlook (excluding Switchboard)
 
Due to expected seasonality and limited operating history, for the second quarter of 2004 the Company expects revenue to be between $46.0 million and $49.0 million and income from continuing operations to be between $4.0 million and $6.0 million.
Full Year 2004 Outlook (excluding Switchboard)
 
As a result of strong performance from each of its business units, the Company is increasing guidance for full year 2004. For the full year 2004, the Company expects revenue to be between $195.0 million and $205.0 million (up from previous guidance of $163.0 to $171.0 million), comprised of $135.0 million to $140.0 million in Search & Directory revenue (up from previous guidance of $120.0 million to $125.0 million) and $60.0 million to $65.0 million in Mobile revenue (up from previous guidance of $43.0 million to $46.0 million). The Company expects income from continuing operations to be between $23.0 million and $27.0 million for full year 2004.
 
Switchboard Outlook
 
Subject to stockholder approval and other conditions, the previously announced Switchboard transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2004. Assuming the acquisition closes on or near July 1, 2004, InfoSpace anticipates Switchboard will contribute approximately $10.0 million to $12.0 million in revenue and $4.0 million to $5.0 million in Search & Directory segment income for the second half of 2004.
 
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific Time/5 p.m Eastern. To access the conference call please dial (800) 238-9007 (U.S.and Canada) or (719) 457-2622 (International).

1.5 . The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or the Transitory Subsidiary, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Additional Action
 
 
2.1 . As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:
Conversion of Capital Stock
 
(a) Each share of the common stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
 
(b) All shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer Holders") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration (as defined below) or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
 
(c) Subject to Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock (other than (i) Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.3(a) below) and (ii) shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $7.75 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof, without any interest thereon. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
 
(d) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.
 
2.2 . The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:
Exchange of Certificates
 
(a) . Promptly after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with the Buyer's transfer agent or a bank or trust company designated by the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to make payments of the Merger Consideration for all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time (the "Exchange Fund").
Exchange Agent
 
(b) . As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Certificates which represented shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Buyer may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Buyer, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (subject to any taxes required to be withheld) the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) as contemplated by this Section 2.2.
Exchange Procedures
 
(c) . The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for payment of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof shall be delivered to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock
 
(d) . Any portion of the Exchange Fund, including accrued interest thereon, which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of
Termination of Exchange Fund
 
Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Buyer, as a general unsecured creditor, for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.
 
(e) . To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
No Liability
 
(f) . Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable provision of law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be.
Withholding Rights
 
(g) . If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
Lost Certificates
 
2.3 .
Dissenting Shares
 
(a) Dissenting Shares (as defined below in this Section 2.3(a)) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless such Company stockholder shall have forfeited its right to appraisal under the DGCL or properly withdrawn its demand for appraisal. If such Company stockholder has so forfeited or withdrawn its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then, (i) as of the occurrence of such event, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and (ii) promptly following the occurrence of such event, the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to such Company stockholder promptly after receipt from such Company Stockholder of a duly executed letter of transmittal and surrendered Certificates as described in
 
Section 2.2(b), a payment representing the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" shall mean shares of Company Common Stock held as of the Effective Time by a stockholder of the Company who has not voted such shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which appraisal shall have been duly demanded and perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively withdrawn or forfeited prior to the Effective Time.
 
(b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands.
 
 
The Company represents and warrants to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as expressly set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary on or before the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III, and any disclosure therein shall provide an exception to or otherwise qualify the representations or warranties of the Company contained in the applicable numbered and lettered paragraph of this Article III corresponding by number and letter to such disclosure; provided, however, that matters disclosed pursuant to one provision, subprovision, section or subsection hereof are deemed disclosed in another section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent that the relevance of such matters to such other provision, subprovision, section or subsection is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure. For purposes of this Article III, documents that are publicly available in unredacted form in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof shall be deemed to have been "provided" to Buyer.
 
3.1 .
Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries
 
(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction listed in Section 3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which jurisdictions constitute the only jurisdictions in which the character of the properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse
 
Effect" means any change, event, circumstance or development with respect to, or effect on (any such change, event, circumstance, development or effect, an "Effect"), the following that is, or would reasonably be expected to be, either individually or in the aggregate with all such other changes, events, circumstances or developments, materially adverse to (i) the business, assets, liabilities, capitalization, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; that none of the following of itself shall be deemed to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect: (a) any Effect that results from changes affecting the industry in which the Company operates generally (which changes do not disproportionately affect the Company or its Subsidiaries), (b) any Effect that results from changes affecting general United States or worldwide economic or capital market conditions (which changes do not disproportionately affect the Company or its Subsidiaries) or (c) any Effect that results from compliance by the Company or its Subsidiaries with the terms of this Agreement. An adverse change in the stock price of the Company Common Stock shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the terms "material", "materially" or "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the meanings ascribed to Company Material Adverse Effect in the third to last sentence of this paragraph or Buyer Material Adverse Effect in Section 4.1.

Company shall take all necessary actions to ensure that all outstanding Company Stock Options are terminated as of the Effective Time, including without limitation, providing each holder of a Company Stock Option with written or electronic notice that such option shall expire as of the Effective Time so that: (i) all Company Stock Options maintained or in effect shall terminate as of the Effective Time, (ii) any Company Employee Plans providing for the issuance, transfers, or grants of any Company Common Stock or any interest in respect of any Company Common Stock shall be terminated or amended to provide that no further issuances, transfers or grants of any Company Common Stock shall be permitted from and after the Effective Time under such Company Employee Plans except as set forth in Section 6.7(b) below, and (iii) from and after the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option or any participant in any Company Stock Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any Company Common Stock or otherwise to receive anything of value from Company or Buyer with respect to such holder's Company Stock Option except as provided in this Agreement.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the Company's obligations to indemnify and hold harmless (including the obligation to advance expenses) each present and former director and officer of the Company (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in all such cases, to the extent that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless exist on the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Company's Certificate of Incorporations, Bylaws or indemnification agreements set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule.

The Company shall cooperate with Buyer in arranging for such a policy to be put into place, including by executing a broker representation letter in favor of Buyer's insurance broker as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof. If the Buyer has not obtained a new insurance policy providing such coverage prior to the Closing Date, the Company may exercise the option in the Existing Policy to extend coverage for six years following the Closing Date and make the payment required by the Existing Policy therefor.
 
(c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other entity and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or, at the Buyer's option, the Buyer, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

6.10 . The Company Board, or a committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing that the disposition by the officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act of Company Common Stock and of options to purchase Company Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

For purposes of employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements provided to Covered Employees maintained or contributed to by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, treat service of each Covered Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries (to the same extent such service is recognized under analogous plans, programs and arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries) as service rendered to the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, solely for the purpose of eligibility to participate and vesting thereunder. To the extent permitted by the terms of the Buyer's 401(k) plan, the Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to allow Covered Employees who are eligible under the terms of the Buyer's 401(k) plan and who have account balances in the Company 401(k) Plan to roll over such account balances to the Buyer's 401(k) plan.
 
(b) The Buyer will honor, and cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, pursuant to their terms, all employee severance plans and employment, change of control or severance agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are specifically identified in Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

Unless Buyer provides such written notice to the Company, the Company shall provide
 
Buyer with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plans have been terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time) pursuant to resolutions of the Company's Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Buyer.

(c) The Company shall pay the Buyer a termination fee of $3 million in the event of any of the following: (A) a termination of this Agreement by the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (with respect to Section 8.1(e)(iv), only in the event of a willful breach); (B) a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f); or (C) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i) (in the case of 8.1(i), except to the extent that the Majority Stockholder's failure to fulfill any material obligation under the Majority Stockholder Voting Agreement has been a principal cause of or has principally resulted in the failure to obtain the Majority Stockholder Approval) if, in the case of this clause (C), (x) prior to such termination a third party shall have made (and, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d), publicly announced) an Acquisition Proposal and (y) within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or the Company enters into an agreement or binding letter of intent providing for an Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated) (provided that for purposes of this clause (C), references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "40%"). Any fee due under this Section 8.3(c) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) within one business day after the date of any termination of this Agreement by the Buyer and (y) upon and as a condition to the effectiveness of, and termination of this Agreement by the Company as described in clause (B) above and (z) upon, and as a condition to the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal described in clause (C) above.

Payment of the fees and expenses described in this Section 8.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a breach of this Agreement.
 
8.4 . This Agreement or any provision hereof may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the Boards of Directors of the Buyer and the Company (or, in the case of the Company, any special committee thereof) at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company or the Transitory Subsidiary, provided, however, that, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.
Amendment
 
8.5 . At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the Boards of Directors of the Buyer and the Company (or, in the case of the Company, any special committee thereof), may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. No waiver by any Party with respect to any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On June 18, 2004, InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace" or "the Company") filed a Form 8-K under Item 2 thereto to report that it had completed the acquisition of Switchboard Incorporated ("Switchboard"), a provider of local online advertising solutions and internet-based yellow pages. In response to parts (a) and (b) of Item 7 of such Form 8-K, InfoSpace stated that it would file the required financial information by amendment, as permitted by Instructions (a)(4) and (b)(2) to Item 7 to Form 8-K. This Form 8-K/A is being filed to provide the required financial information.
 
Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits.
 
(a) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired.
 
The required financial statements for Switchboard for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2003 are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and are incorporated by reference herein.
 
(b) Pro forma financial information.
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company consist of the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 (as revised to reflect its Payment Solutions division as a discontinued operation) and for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2004, to give effect to the acquisition of Switchboard by the Company (collectively, the "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements"). The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations are presented as if the acquisition of Switchboard by the Company occurred on January 1, 2003 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet is presented as if the acquisition of Switchboard by the Company occurred on March 31, 2004. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to reflect the results of operations that would have existed or occurred had such transaction taken place on the dates indicated, nor do they purport to reflect the financial condition or results of operations that will exist or occur in the future. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's and Switchboard's historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included in their respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and in their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Switchboard in exchange for cash of $159.4 million, plus estimated transaction fees of approximately $5.6 million, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $165.0 million. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements present the acquisition of Switchboard under the purchase method of accounting, which reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the time of the merger. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the preliminary purchase price allocation based on the Company's best estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to finalization of the valuation of intangible assets, other assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company does not anticipate the final purchase price allocation to be materially different.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements consist of the historical statements of operations and balance sheet of InfoSpace, Inc. ("the Company") and Switchboard, Incorporated ("Switchboard") for the year ended December 31, 2003 and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2004, with adjustments to reflect the acquisition of Switchboard by the Company, as described herein:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which approximated their carrying amounts at the acquisition date. The expected life of the core technology is assumed to be three years, after which substantial modifications and enhancements would be required for the technology to remain competitive. The expected life of the customer contracts and merchant listings is assumed to range between one and three years, which is consistent with the expected cash flows from the contracts and merchant listings. The pro forma adjustments represent the amortization of the intangible assets over their respective useful lives. The purchase price in excess of the fair values of the net assets acquired and the identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks are considered intangible assets with indefinite lives and, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, , no amortization will be recorded. Goodwill and trademarks will be tested for impairment at least annually, with the Company's other indefinite lived assets.

See accompanying notes.
 
 
A. Nature of Business
 
Switchboard Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Switchboard"), commenced operations in February 1996. From Switchboard's inception (February 19, 1996) until its initial public offering on March 7, 2000, Switchboard was a unit and later a subsidiary of ePresence Inc. ("ePresence"). As of March 31, 2004, ePresence beneficially owned approximately 51.0% of Switchboard's common stock. Switchboard is a provider of local online advertising products, enabled by its consumer-oriented online yellow and white pages directory technology.
 
Switchboard generates revenue primarily from merchant and national advertisers that pay to advertise in the Switchboard-powered yellow pages directories of its licensees, as well as in its own directory website, www.switchboard.com. Switchboard licenses its yellow pages directory technology to Internet portals, traditional yellow pages publishers and newspaper publishers. Switchboard operates in one business segment as a provider of advertising solutions through its web-hosted directory technologies and customized yellow pages directory technology, and classifies its revenue into two categories, namely net merchant network revenue and national banner and site sponsorship revenue.
 
Net merchant network revenue includes revenue from various licensing agreements with Switchboard's directory technology licensees and also includes engineering and other fees for services provided to support the directories and programs of Switchboard's licensees. In addition, net merchant network revenue includes revenue from running priority placement, local performance-based and content-targeted advertising in the Switchboard.com yellow pages directory, and building and hosting websites for local merchant advertisers. During the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, net merchant network revenue comprised 85.2% and 88.5% of Switchboard's net revenue, respectively.
 
Switchboard also continues to generate revenue from the sale of national banner and site sponsorship advertising on white and yellow pages, as well as maps pages, across both www.switchboard.com and the websites of several directory technology licensees. During the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, 14.8% and 11.5% of Switchboard's net revenue, respectively, was derived from the sale of national banner and site sponsorship advertising.
 
Switchboard is subject to risks and uncertainties common to growing technology-based companies, including rapid technological change, acceptance and effectiveness of Internet advertising, dependence on principal products and third-party technology, new product development, new product introductions and other activities of competitors, dependence on key personnel, security and privacy issues, dependence on strategic customer and vendor relationships and limited operating history.
 
Switchboard has experienced substantial net losses since its inception and, as of March 31, 2004, had an accumulated deficit of $107.0 million. Such losses and accumulated deficit resulted from Switchboard's lack of substantial revenue and significantly increased costs incurred in the development of Switchboard's products and services, in the preliminary establishment of Switchboard's infrastructure and in the development of Switchboard's brand. Switchboard expects to continue to incur significant operating expenses in order to execute its current business plan, particularly sales and marketing and product development expenses. Switchboard believes that the funds currently available would be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future.
 
B. Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial information set forth therein. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The balance sheet amounts at December 31, 2003 in the accompanying financial statements were derived from Switchboard's audited 2003 financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, as amended. Results of operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2004 are not necessarily indicative of future financial results.
 
Investors should read these interim consolidated financial statements in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Switchboard's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, as amended, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2004.
 
C. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
 
Switchboard accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," ("APB 25") and related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of Switchboard's common stock at the date of grant. Switchboard has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS 123") through disclosure only. All stock-based awards to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with SFAS 123.
 
At March 31, 2004, Switchboard has three stock-based employee compensation plans as defined by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123" ("SFAS 148"). Switchboard accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25 and related interpretations. The table below illustrates the effect on the net (loss) income if Switchboard had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation (in thousands, except per share data). Because options vest over several years and additional option grants are expected to be made in future years, the below pro-forma effects are not necessarily indicative of the pro-forma effects on future periods.
 
 
D. Net (Loss) Income Per Share
 
Basic net (loss) income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding less any restricted shares. Diluted (loss) income per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, the proceeds of which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase outstanding common stock using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares also include the unvested portion of restricted stock, as well as the effect of unearned compensation resulting from the unvested portion of stock options issued at an exercise price lower than the market price on the date of issuance of the stock option.
 
A reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, options to purchase 3,746,134 and 2,531,190 shares of common stock and shares of restricted common stock of none and 225,000, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted net (loss) income per share since their inclusion would be antidilutive.
 
E. Comprehensive (Loss) Income
 
Other comprehensive (loss) income is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
F. Revenue Recognition
 
Switchboard generates its revenue primarily from merchant advertising placements promoted in the Switchboard-powered directories of its licensees, as well as in its own directory website. Generally, revenue is recognized as services are provided, so long as no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Switchboard believes that it is able to make reliable judgments regarding the creditworthiness of its customers based upon historical and current information available to Switchboard. There can be no assurances that Switchboard's payment experience with its customers will be consistent with past experience or that the financial condition of these customers will not decline in future periods, the result of which could be the failure to collect invoiced amounts. Some of these amounts could be material, resulting in an increase in Switchboard's provision for bad debts.
 
Switchboard licenses its directory technology to its licensees. Licensees can enter into a development and licensing arrangement with Switchboard whereby Switchboard creates and/or modifies a private labeled web-hosted directory. Switchboard recognizes revenue under these agreements when evidence of an arrangement exists, the related fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the fee is reasonably assured, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB") and No. 104, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB Nos. 101 and 104"). Revenue received by Switchboard for such development and licensing arrangements is deferred until such time as the customer accepts the directory. Switchboard considers customer acceptance to occur at the time the directory is made accessible to the licensee for general use. After acceptance by the customer, revenue from such development and licensing agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the agreement. Once the web-hosted directory is operational, Switchboard may earn additional fees based on the number of merchants promoted within the directory. Per merchant license fees or additional engineering and other services fees are recognized as earned. Per merchant fees are considered earned in the period during which the merchant advertisement is displayed in Switchboard's website and/or the website of Switchboard's licensees. Additional engineering and other services fees are considered earned in the period during which the services were provided.
 
Switchboard's most significant licensee is America Online, Inc. ("AOL"). Revenues recognized under Switchboard's agreement with AOL are recognized in accordance with SAB Nos. 101 and 104. Prior to October 2003, Switchboard received a share of directory advertisement revenue earned by AOL from the sales of advertisements on the yellow pages directory it provides to AOL, less an estimate for amounts deemed uncollectible by AOL. Switchboard recorded as merchant licensing revenue the net amount received from AOL in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent" ("EITF No. 99-19"), as it is earned. Switchboard considers this merchant licensing revenue earned during the period that AOL displays the advertisements sold to its customers in its yellow page directory. Switchboard also earns revenue from AOL through the provision of engineering and other services to AOL. Switchboard considers the delivery of engineering and other services to be a separate earnings process and recognizes revenue from engineering and other services in the period during which these services are delivered. Subsequent to October 2003, Switchboard receives an annual license fee. Switchboard bifurcates this amount between merchant and platform licensing fees and engineering services fees. Switchboard recognizes revenue from merchant and platform licensing fees as earned. Switchboard considers revenue from merchant and platform licensing earned as it provides AOL the yellow pages directory and displays AOL's advertisers in the Switchboard.com yellow pages. In addition, included as an offset to revenue is consideration given to AOL, for which the benefits of such consideration are not separately identifiable from the revenue obtained from AOL.
 
Switchboard also earns fees from pay-for-performance advertising. Switchboard recognizes revenue for pay-for-performance advertising in the month during which it provides the advertising service to its customers. The service is considered provided when Switchboard delivers the performance element of the contract - specifically, when Internet users click on Switchboard's customers' advertisements displayed on Switchboard's website.
 
Switchboard sells national and local advertisements in Switchboard.com through its direct sales force, as well as through third-parties. For these advertisements, Switchboard is generally paid a monthly fee based on the number of advertisements placed into www.switchboard.com. Switchboard recognizes this monthly fee as revenue as it is earned. Switchboard considers this fee earned during the period that Switchboard provides the advertising on www.switchboard.com.
 
Deferred revenue is principally comprised of billings relating to advertising agreements and licensing fees received pursuant to advertising or services agreements in advance of revenue recognition. Unbilled receivables are principally comprised of revenues earned and recognized in advance of invoicing customers, resulting primarily from contractually defined billing schedules.
 
G. AOL
 
Revenue recognized from AOL during the three months ended March 31, 2004 was $1.2 million, or 28.9% of revenue, of which $600,000 was from engineering services. Revenue recognized from AOL during the three months ended March 31, 2003 was $1.6 million, or 48.8% of revenue, of which $633,000 was from engineering services. Net amounts due from AOL included in accounts receivable March 31, 2004 were $400,000. There were no amounts due from AOL at December 31, 2003. At March 31, 2004, AOL beneficially owned 7.8% of Switchboard's outstanding common stock.
 
H. Related Parties
 
ePresence provided Switchboard with telephone service and support under a corporate services agreement during the three months ended March 31, 2003. The corporate services agreement expired on December 31, 2003. Under the agreement, Switchboard paid ePresence at a rate of $75,000 per year for these services. ePresence has agreed to continue to provide these services at a rate of $75,000 per year until such time as Switchboard is able to provide these services itself. Switchboard recorded $19,000 in expense and paid ePresence $19,000 under the agreements in both the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. Switchboard had $6,000 accrued under the agreements as of March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003.
 
Switchboard leases the space it currently occupies from ePresence under a sublease that expires on September 30, 2005. Under the current sublease agreement, Switchboard pays rent at a rate of $210,000 per year. Under its sublease agreements with ePresence, Switchboard recorded rent expense of $52,000 and $57,000 and paid ePresence $54,000 and $81,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Switchboard had $18,000 and $19,000 accrued under the sublease agreements as of March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Switchboard believes that the amounts paid to ePresence under its services agreements and subleases with ePresence are competitive with amounts Switchboard would have paid to outside third parties for the same or similar services and leased space.
 
Certain directors of Switchboard hold positions as officers or directors of ePresence. The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Switchboard is also Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer of ePresence. One director of Switchboard is Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of ePresence. Another director of Switchboard is also a director of ePresence. In the three months ended March 31, 2004, a total of $23,000 in compensation was paid to these directors by Switchboard for their services. In the three months ended March 31, 2003, no compensation was paid to these directors.
 
I. Transaction Costs
 
On March 26, 2004, Switchboard announced a definitive agreement to be acquired by InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace"). In connection with the transaction, each outstanding share of Switchboard will be converted into a right to receive $7.75 per share in cash, without interest, and Switchboard will become a wholly owned subsidiary of InfoSpace. The transaction is expected to close during June 2004. The completion of the transaction is subject to several conditions, including the approval of both Switchboard's and ePresence's stockholders and regulatory approval. On May 10, 2004, Switchboard filed and on May [12], 2004, Switchboard mailed to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement regarding this matter. Investors and security holders are urged to read carefully that filing
 
because it contains important information in connection with the proposed acquisition. In the three months ended March 31, 2004, Switchboard recorded $406,000 in fees associated with the transaction as a component of transaction costs.
 
On October 23, 2003, Switchboard filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 in connection with a proposed underwritten offering of 8,815,171 shares of its common stock, plus an over-allotment option of 1,322,250 shares. Of the shares proposed to be sold, including the over-allotment option, 10,037,421 shares were proposed to be sold by ePresence and certain other selling stockholders, and 100,000 were proposed to be sold by Switchboard. The offering was initiated by ePresence in order to facilitate an orderly disposition of its Switchboard holdings in conjunction with ePresence's announced plan of liquidation. In light of the proposed transaction with InfoSpace Switchboard expects to abandon this offering.
 
As of December 31, 2003, Switchboard had incurred $511,000 of costs associated with the offering. Switchboard classified these deferred offering costs as a long-term asset on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. In the three months ended March 31, 2004, Switchboard recorded as a component of non-recurring transaction costs $721,000 in expense associated with the proposed offering. This amount was comprised of the $511,000 of deferred costs at December 31, 2003 as well as $210,000 in costs incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2004.
 
J. Class Action Lawsuits
 
Switchboard, its former CEO and director Douglas J. Greenlaw, and its directors Dean Polnerow, William P. Ferry, Robert M. Wadsworth, Richard Spaulding and David Strohm have been named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit filed by plaintiff David Osher in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County on March 26, 2004. The Company was served notice of this complaint on March 31, 2004. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the $7.75 per share consideration contemplated by the merger agreement with InfoSpace Inc. is unfair and grossly inadequate, that the director defendants failed to inform themselves of Switchboard's market value and failed to act in the best interest of all of Switchboard's stockholders, as opposed to the interests of ePresence in liquidating its holdings in Switchboard, and that the director defendants therefore breached their fiduciary duties to the public stockholders of Switchboard by approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages. Switchboard believes that the litigation is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against such litigation.

SWITCHBOARD INCORPORATED
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A. Nature of Business
 
Switchboard Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Switchboard"), commenced operations in February 1996. From Switchboard's inception (February 19, 1996) until its initial public offering on March 7, 2000, Switchboard was a unit and later a subsidiary of ePresence Inc. ("ePresence"). As of December 31, 2003, ePresence beneficially owned approximately 51.1% of Switchboard's common stock. Switchboard is a provider of local online advertising products, enabled by its consumer-oriented online yellow and white pages directory technology.
 
Switchboard generates revenue primarily from merchant and national advertisers that pay to advertise in the Switchboard-powered yellow pages directories of its licensees, as well as in its own directory website, . Switchboard licenses its yellow pages directory technology to Internet portals, traditional yellow pages publishers and newspaper publishers. Switchboard operates in one business segment as a provider of advertising solutions through its web-hosted directory technologies and customized yellow pages directory technology, and classifies its revenue into two categories, namely net merchant network revenue and national banner and site sponsorship revenue.
www.switchboard.com
 
Net merchant network revenue includes revenue from various licensing agreements with Switchboard's directory technology licensees and also includes engineering and other fees for services provided to support the directories and programs of Switchboard's licensees. In addition, net merchant network revenue includes revenue from running priority placement, local performance based, and content targeted advertising in the Switchboard.com yellow pages directory, and building and hosting websites for local merchant advertisers. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, net merchant network revenue comprised 88.4%, 87.9% and 66.9% of our net revenue, respectively.
 
Switchboard also continues to generate revenue from the sale of national banner and site sponsorship advertising on white and yellow pages, as well as maps pages, across both and the websites of several directory technology licensees. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, 11.6%, 12.1% and 33.1% of Switchboard's net revenue, respectively, was derived from the sale of national banner and site sponsorship advertising.
www.switchboard.com
 
Switchboard is subject to risks and uncertainties common to growing technology-based companies, including rapid technological change, growth and commercial acceptance of the Internet, acceptance and effectiveness of Internet advertising, dependence on principal products and third-party technology, new product development, new product introductions and other activities of competitors, dependence on key personnel, security and privacy issues, dependence on strategic customer and vendor relationships and limited operating history.
 
Switchboard has experienced substantial net losses since its inception and, as of December 31, 2003, had an accumulated deficit of $106.7 million. Such losses and accumulated deficit resulted from Switchboard's lack of substantial revenue and significantly increased costs incurred in the development of Switchboard's products and services, in the preliminary establishment of Switchboard's infrastructure and in the development of Switchboard's brand. Switchboard expects to continue to incur significant operating expenses in order to execute its current business plan, particularly sales and marketing and product development expenses. Switchboard believes that the funds currently available would be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future.
 
B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The accompanying financial statements, which are derived from both the independent books and records of Switchboard and its subsidiaries and the historical books and records of ePresence, include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Switchboard at historical cost. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
 
These financial statements are intended to present management's estimates of the results of operations and financial condition of Switchboard as if it had operated as a stand-alone company since inception. Certain of the costs and expenses are management estimates of the cost of services provided by ePresence and its subsidiaries. As a result, the financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had Switchboard operated as a nonaffiliated entity.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent liabilities at the period end, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
 
Switchboard considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Those instruments with maturities as of the balance sheet date between three and twelve months are considered to be short-term marketable securities, and investments with maturities as of the balance sheet date of greater than one year are classified as long-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are carried at market, and consist primarily of interest bearing deposits with major financial institutions.
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"), Switchboard classifies all of its marketable equity securities as available for sale securities. These securities are valued at fair value and consist primarily of U.S government securities, corporate and municipal issues and interest bearing deposits with major banks. Unrealized holdings gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of Stockholders' Equity. Other-than-temporary unrealized losses are reported as a component of other income (expense) within the Statement of Operations.
 
In 2003, 2002 and 2001, purchases of marketable securities were $285,000, $12.8 million and $81.9 million, respectively. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities were $5.5 million, $53.5 million and $79.5 million, respectively. In 2002, Switchboard recorded $57,000 in realized losses on marketable securities.
 
Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated asset lives:
 
 
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the asset's estimated useful life or the remaining life of the lease, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred, while betterments are capitalized. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective amounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations.
 
Goodwill and Intangibles
 
Switchboard recorded amounts in excess of assets acquired pursuant to its acquisition of Envenue, Inc. ("Envenue") in November 2000 as goodwill. Pursuant to a distribution agreement Switchboard entered into with America Online, Inc. ("AOL", the "Directory Agreement"), Switchboard issued shares of its common stock to AOL. The value of these shares of common stock had been recorded as an intangible asset, and had been amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the Directory Agreement. As of December 31, 2001, Switchboard evaluated the net realizable value of all of its assets related to AOL and Envenue as a result of lower than anticipated revenues in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" ("SFAS 121") and determined that both its assets related to AOL and Envenue had been impaired. As a result, Switchboard recorded a loss on impairment as a component of its special charge in 2001 (Notes E, F and Q).
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), Switchboard periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for potential impairment. Potential impairment is assessed when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Recoverability of these assets is assessed based on undiscounted expected future cash flows from the assets, considering a number of factors including past operating results, budgets and economic projections, market trends and product development cycles. An impairment in the carrying value of each asset is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from the asset are less than its carrying value. Switchboard believes that there has been no impairment of its long-lived assets as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.
 
Advertising Expense
 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $34,000 and $15,430,000 in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2001, the costs included $9,680,000 of non-cash advertising received from Viacom Inc. (formerly CBS Corporation) (Note K).
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Switchboard generates its revenue primarily from merchant advertising placements promoted in the Switchboard-powered directories of its licensees, as well as in its own directory website. Generally, revenue is recognized as services are provided, so long as no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Switchboard believes that it is able to make reliable judgments regarding the creditworthiness of its customers based upon historical and current information available to Switchboard. There can be no assurances that Switchboard's payment experience with its customers will be consistent with past experience or that the financial condition of these customers will not decline in future periods, the result of which could be the failure to collect invoiced amounts. Some of these amounts could be material, resulting in an increase in Switchboard's provision for bad debts.
 
Switchboard licenses its directory technology to its licensees. Licensees can enter into a development and licensing arrangement with Switchboard whereby Switchboard creates and/or modifies a private labeled web-hosted directory. Switchboard recognizes revenue under these agreements when evidence of an arrangement exists, the related fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the fee is reasonably assured, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB") and No. 104, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB Nos. 101 and 104"). Revenue received by Switchboard for such development and licensing arrangements is deferred until such time as the customer accepts the directory.
 
Switchboard considers customer acceptance to occur at the time the directory is made accessible to the licensee for general use. After acceptance by the customer, revenue from such development and licensing agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the agreement. Once the web-hosted directory is operational, Switchboard may earn additional fees based on the number of merchants promoted within the directory. Per merchant license fees or additional engineering and other services fees are recognized as earned. Per merchant fees are considered earned in the period during which the merchant advertisement is displayed in our website and/or the website of our licensees. Additional engineering and other services fees are considered earned in the period during which the services were provided.
 
Switchboard's most significant licensee is America Online, Inc. ("AOL"). Revenues recognized under Switchboard's agreement with AOL are recognized in accordance with SAB Nos. 101 and 104. Prior to October 2003, Switchboard received a share of directory advertisement revenue earned by AOL from the sales of advertisements on the yellow pages directory it provides to AOL, less an estimate for amounts deemed uncollectible by AOL. Switchboard recorded as merchant licensing revenue the net amount received from AOL in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent" ("EITF No. 99-19"), as it is earned. Switchboard considers this merchant licensing revenue earned during the period that AOL displays the advertisements sold to its customers in its yellow page directory. Switchboard also earns revenue from AOL through the provision of engineering and other services to AOL. Switchboard considers the delivery of engineering and other services to be a separate earnings process and recognizes revenue from engineering and other services in the period during which these services are delivered. Subsequent to October 2003, Switchboard receives an annual license fee. Switchboard bifurcates this amount between merchant and platform licensing fees and engineering services fees. Switchboard recognizes revenue from merchant and platform licensing fees as earned. Switchboard considers revenue from merchant and platform licensing earned as it provides AOL the yellow pages directory and displays AOL's advertisers in the Switchboard.com yellow pages. In addition, included as an offset to revenue is consideration given to AOL, for which the benefits of such consideration are not separately identifiable from the revenue obtained from AOL.
 
Switchboard sells national and local advertisements in Switchboard.com through its direct sales force, as well as through third-parties. For these advertisements, Switchboard is generally paid a monthly fee based on the number of advertisements placed into . Switchboard recognizes this monthly fee as revenue as it is earned. Switchboard considers this fee earned during the period that they provide the advertising on www.switchboard.com.
www.switchboard.com
 
Deferred revenue is principally comprised of billings relating to advertising agreements and licensing fees received pursuant to advertising or services agreements in advance of revenue recognition. Unbilled receivables are principally comprised of revenues earned and recognized in advance of invoicing customers, resulting primarily from contractually defined billing schedules.
 
Cost of Revenue
 
Switchboard's cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses paid to third parties under data licensing and website creation and hosting agreements, search engine database inclusion expenses and employee compensation expense associated with the delivery of additional engineering, as well as other direct expenses incurred to maintain the operations of Switchboard's website and the web-hosted platforms of its licensees. Expenses associated with data licensing are largely fixed in nature and are recorded as expense on a straight-line basis. Direct expenses incurred to maintain the operations of Switchboard's website and those of its licensees are recorded as expense as incurred. Website creation and hosting expenses and search engine database inclusion expenses are variable based upon the number of merchants receiving website services and the amount of search engine database inclusion purchased. Switchboard recognizes these expenses as the website creation and hosting expense and search engine database inclusion expenses are incurred. Employee compensation expense associated with the delivery of additional engineering is recorded as a cost of revenue in the period during which the additional engineering was performed.
 
Risks, Concentrations and Uncertainties
 
Switchboard invests its cash and cash equivalents primarily in deposits, money market funds and investment grade securities with financial institutions. Switchboard has not experienced any material realized losses to date on its invested cash.
 
A potential exposure to Switchboard is a concentration of credit risk in accounts receivable. Switchboard minimizes this risk by maintaining reserves for credit losses and, to date, such losses have been within management's expectations. These expectations are based on historical experience, analysis of information currently available to Switchboard with respect to its customer's financial position, as well as various other factors. As of December 31 2002, AOL accounted for 28.8% of accounts receivable. AOL accounted for 41.2% and 41.8% of net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. One customer accounted for 11.6% of net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2001.
 
Income Taxes
 
Switchboard accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A deferred tax asset is established for the expected future benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. A valuation reserve against net deferred tax assets is required if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts of Switchboard's financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and a note payable, approximate their fair values.
 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 
Switchboard accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," ("APB 25") and related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of Switchboard's common stock at the date of grant. Switchboard has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS 123") through disclosure only (Note N). All stock-based awards to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with SFAS 123.
 
At December 31, 2003, Switchboard has three stock-based employee compensation plans as defined by SFAS 148, which are more fully described in Note N. Switchboard accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25 and related interpretations. The table below illustrates the effect on the net income (loss) if Switchboard had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation (in thousands, except per share data). Because options vest over several years and additional option grants are expected to be made in future years, the below pro-forma effects are not necessarily indicative of the pro-forma effects on future years.
 
 
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in each of the following periods:
 
 
The weighted average grant date fair values using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were $5.19, $3.28 and $3.99 during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
Net Income (Loss) per Share
 
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding less any restricted shares. Diluted income (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, the proceeds of which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase outstanding common stock using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares also include the unvested portion of restricted stock, as well as the effect of unearned compensation resulting from the unvested portion of stock options issued at an exercise price lower than the market price on the date of issuance of the stock option.
 
A reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, options to purchase 1,176,834, 3,566,603 and 4,206,080 shares of common stock, respectively, warrants for none, 918,468 and 918,468 shares of common stock, respectively, and restricted common stock of none, 300,000 and 746,260, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share since their inclusion would be antidilutive.
 
Comprehensive Loss
 
Switchboard adheres to SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", which requires companies to report all changes in stockholders' equity during a period, except those resulting from investment by owners and distribution to owners, in comprehensive income in the period in which they are recognized.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which was issued in January 2003. Switchboard will be required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in variable interest entities created after December 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material effect on Switchboard's financial position, results or operations or cash flows.
 
C. Barter Transactions
 
Switchboard had no barter transactions in the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Switchboard had barter transactions totaling $836,000, or 9.0% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2001 in which Switchboard received promotion in exchange for promotion on Switchboard's website or through direct e-mail distributions. Revenue from advertising barter has been valued based on similar cash transactions which occurred within six months prior to the date of the barter transaction in accordance with EITF Issue No. 99-17 "Accounting for Advertising Barter Transactions".
 
D. Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment consisted of the following:
 
 
Depreciation expense and amortization of leased assets for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1,213,000, $1,521,000 and $1,235,000, respectively.
 
E. AOL
 
In December 2000, Switchboard entered into a Directory Agreement with AOL to develop a new directory and local advertising platform and product set to be featured across specified AOL properties (the "Directory Platform"). In November 2001, April 2002, August 2002, November 2002 and October 2003, certain terms of the agreement were amended. Under the original four-year term of the amended Directory Agreement, Switchboard was to have shared with AOL specified directory advertisement revenue. In general, Switchboard received a majority of the first $12.0 million of such directory advertisement revenue, less any billable engineering revenue earned from AOL after June 30, 2002, and a lesser share of any additional directory advertisement revenue over and above the initial $12.0 million pursuant to the August 2002 amendment. Switchboard paid AOL and recorded an asset of $13.0 million at the signing of the original Directory Agreement. Following the incorporation of the Directory Platform on the AOL.com, AOL Service and Digital City properties ("AOL Roll-In") in January 2002, Switchboard recorded a second asset and a liability related to future payments of $13.0 million. In April 2002, Switchboard established an additional asset and liability of $1.0 million and paid $2.0 million upon the execution of the April 2002 amendment. Under the April 2002 amended agreement, Switchboard was scheduled to make six additional quarterly payments of $2.0 million each, replacing the $13.0 million originally owed upon the AOL Roll-In.
 
The August 2002 amendment, among other things, eliminated the $12.0 million in remaining additional payments established in the April 2002 amendment. AOL committed to pay Switchboard at least $2.0 million in consulting or service fees over the term of the agreement under a payment schedule which ended in September 2002, of which AOL paid all $2.0 million and Switchboard delivered all $2.0 million in services to AOL. In addition, Switchboard was required to provide up to 300 hours of engineering services per month to AOL at no charge, if requested by AOL for the term of the agreement. These 300 hours were provided to support the Directory Platform, from which we shared in directory revenue over the term of the amended agreement. Any engineering services provided by Switchboard in excess of 300 hours per month were charged to AOL on a time and materials basis. AOL typically exceeds these 300 hours each month. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, consulting and service fees totaled $2.0 million, $1.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
 
The October 2003 amendment, among other things, extended the term of the agreement for an additional year until December 11, 2005, and provides that Switchboard will receive $4.8 million annually from AOL, payable in monthly increments of $400,000, in exchange for providing, maintaining and customizing the AOL yellow pages directory technology and inclusion of current AOL merchants in Switchboard's yellow pages directory. In addition, the amended agreement creates the opportunity for both parties to share in revenue generated from advertising products that combine both AOL's and Switchboard's consumer audience. The revenue sharing arrangement, based on a percentage of AOL merchant subscription revenue, that was previously in effect has been eliminated. AOL and Switchboard are now able to sell advertising products offering both local merchant and national advertisers access to the combined consumer audience of both AOL and Switchboard yellow pages. As part of the consideration for the $4.8 million annual fee, if requested by AOL, Switchboard is obligated to provide AOL with up to 3,000 hours of engineering services per fiscal quarter in order to customize and further AOL's directory platform. In addition, AOL may carry-over up to 1,000 of its unused engineering hours into the next quarter. At no time at the end of any fiscal quarter may the unused hours carried forward exceed 1,000 hours. Revenue attributable to any unused hours that are carried forward into the following fiscal quarter are valued using Switchboard's standard hourly rates for engineering services and deferred until the hours carried forward are either used or the right to use them expires. Switchboard bills AOL on a time and materials basis for any hours of engineering services in excess of the 3,000 hours per quarter and recognizes this revenue during the period in which the engineering services are delivered. The October 2003 amended agreement is subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of specified events, including, without limitation (1) Switchboard being acquired by one of certain third parties, or (2) AOL acquiring one of certain third parties and AOL paying Switchboard a termination fee of $25.0 million.
 
Subsequent to the October 2003 amendment to the AOL agreement, Switchboard has bifurcated the monthly fee received from AOL into a directory license fee and an engineering service fee in accordance with EITF No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangement with Multiple Deliverables" ("EITF No. 00-21") and SAB 104. EITF 00-21 and SAB 104 allow for accounting for separate elements of contract if the elements qualify as separate accounting units, and if vendor specific evidence of fair value can be established for each element under the arrangement. If vendor specific evidence of fair value cannot be established for all elements under the arrangement, but can be established for the undelivered elements, value may be allocated to the delivered elements based on the residual method. Switchboard has established vendor specific evidence of fair value for the engineering services and has allocated remaining value to the license fees. Switchboard recognizes revenue for each element in accordance with SAB 101 and 104, when evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are fixed and determinable, services have been delivered and collectibility is assured.
 
In connection with entering into the Directory Agreement, in December 2000, Switchboard issued to AOL 746,260 shares of its common stock, which were restricted from transfer until the AOL Roll-In, which occurred on January 2, 2002. Switchboard valued these shares using the fair market value for its common stock at the time of issuance, recording an asset of $3.1 million in December 2000. Switchboard also agreed to issue to AOL an additional 746,260 shares of common stock if the Directory Agreement continued after two years and a further 746,260 shares of common stock if the Directory Agreement continued after three years. Under the amended agreement, the requirement to issue additional shares upon the two and three-year continuations has been eliminated. If Switchboard renews the Directory Agreement with AOL for at least an additional four years after the initial amended five-year term, it is required to issue to AOL a warrant to purchase up to 721,385 shares of common stock at a per share purchase price of $4.32. Switchboard will record the value of this potential warrant when it is issuable.
 
The $13.0 million paid and the value of the stock issued upon the signing of the Directory Agreement was amortized on a straight-line basis over the original four-year estimated life of the agreement. In accordance with EITF Issue
 
01-9 "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)", Switchboard recorded the amortization of its AOL asset as an offset to merchant network revenue of $2.0 million and $4.0 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of December 2001 and as part of the September 2002 restatement of Switchboard's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, the remaining unamortized amounts were written down to zero as a result of an impairment analysis as of December 31, 2001 (Note Q). In 2002, Switchboard recorded amortization based upon the remaining net book value of its AOL assets established upon the AOL Roll-In and April 2002 amendment on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the amended agreement.
 
As a result of the elimination in the August 2002 amendment of the remaining $12.0 million owed to AOL, an adjustment to amortization of consideration given to a customer of $482,000 was recorded in 2002, offsetting amortization recorded in the period. Throughout the remaining initial term of the amended agreement, Switchboard will no longer record amortization of consideration given to AOL as these assets are now fully amortized and no further consideration is due AOL. The following table illustrates the amounts provided to AOL and the associated amortization expense and impairment charge in each of the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 (in thousands).
 
 
Revenue recognized from AOL, net of amortization of consideration given to AOL, was $6,265,000, or 41.2% of net revenue, $4,906,000, or 41.8% of net revenue, and $26,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net amounts due from AOL included in accounts receivable at December 31, 2002 were $549,000. There were no amounts due from AOL at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, AOL beneficially owned 7.8% of Switchboard's outstanding common stock.
 
F. Envenue Acquisition
 
On November 24, 2000, Switchboard acquired Envenue, a wireless provider of advanced product searching technologies designed to drive leads to traditional retailers. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. The total purchase price included consideration of $2.0 million in cash, which was to be paid on or before May 24, 2002, and $38,000 in recorded value of stock options to purchase 10,200 shares of Switchboard's common stock issued to non-employees. Switchboard used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the options granted. Switchboard did not pay the $2.0 million on or before May 24, 2002, as it was involved in a contractual dispute with the previous owners of Envenue. In June 2002, Switchboard placed $2.0 million into an escrow account, which was to be held until the resolution of this dispute. In October 2002, Switchboard paid $410,000 out of the escrowed funds, representing the undisputed portion of the purchase price plus interest from the original maturity date to the former stockholders of Envenue. The remaining $1.6 million of the purchase price, which was non-interest bearing, was classified separately in the accompanying financial statements as of December 31, 2002. Switchboard recorded $1.6 million as restricted cash at December 31, 2002 related to the cash held in escrow. In June 2003, Switchboard paid the former owners of Envenue $1.7 million to settle all claims related to the acquisition of Envenue. As a result, Switchboard no longer has funds in escrow related to the matter.
 
Switchboard recorded $2,285,000 of goodwill from the acquisition in 2000 and was amortizing this goodwill on a straight-line basis using an estimated useful life of 5 years. In December 2001, Switchboard exercised its rights under the acquisition agreement to substantially reduce the funding of its Envenue acquisition. Additionally, Switchboard evaluated the carrying value of its goodwill in Envenue, and determined it would not be fully recovered through estimated undiscounted
 
future operating cash flows. As a result during the three months ending December 31, 2001, Switchboard recorded an impairment charge of $1,859,000 related to the Envenue goodwill. This impairment charge was recorded as a component of special charges within the Switchboard's statement of operations (Note Q).
 
G. Deferred Offering Costs
 
On October 23, 2003, Switchboard filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 in connection with a proposed underwritten offering of 8,815,171 shares of its common stock, plus an over-allotment option of 1,322,250 shares. Of the shares proposed to be sold, including the over-allotment option, 10,037,421 shares are proposed to be sold by ePresence, Inc. and certain other selling shareholders, and 100,000 are proposed to be sold by Switchboard. The offering is being initiated by ePresence in order to facilitate an orderly disposition of its Switchboard holdings in conjunction with its announced plan of liquidation. At the completion of the offering, Switchboard anticipates that ePresence will continue to own 5.6% of Switchboard's shares. If the over-allotment option is exercised and the additional 1,322,250 shares are sold, ePresence will no longer own any shares of Switchboard. The sale of ePresence's entire holdings of Switchboard stock is subject to the approval of ePresence's shareholders. However, ePresence may sell up to approximately 5.4 million of its shares of Switchboard stock without shareholder approval.
 
As of December 31, 2003, Switchboard had incurred $511,000 of costs associated with the offering, of which $15,000 was paid in 2003. Switchboard has classified these deferred offering costs as a long-term asset on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. Switchboard anticipates offsetting these costs with proceeds received from the offering.
 
H. Marketable Securities
 
The following is a summary of investments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands):
 
 
In August 1999, in connection with a Development, Access and License agreement with a third party, Switchboard was issued a warrant for 150,000 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $9.19 per share. In September 2001 and March 2002, Switchboard assessed a decline in market value of the third party's publicly traded common stock and determined that the decline in value was other-than-temporary. As a result, Switchboard recorded as a component of other income and expense unrealized losses on investments of $6,000 and $55,000 in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In June 2002, the warrant expired.
 
In June 2002, Switchboard entered into a loan and security agreement (the "SVB Financing Agreement") with Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB") (Note P). As a result of the conditions contained within the SVB Financing Agreement, Switchboard liquidated $35.7 million in marketable securities previously held at Fleet for transfer to SVB. This liquidation resulted in $402,000 in realized gains during 2002.
 
I. Accrued Expenses
 
Accrued expenses consist of the following at:
 
 
J. Related Parties
 
Under an agreement dated March 7, 2000, ePresence provided certain administrative, technical support and equipment maintenance services for Switchboard. Following the expiration of the March 2000 agreement, Switchboard and ePresence entered into a corporate services agreement dated March 7, 2002, under which ePresence provided Switchboard with telephone service and support only, for an amount of $75,000 per year. The March 2002 agreement included past services incurred since the March 7, 2001 expiration of the previous agreement, as well as telephone services through February 28, 2003. The March 2002 agreement expired in February 2003. Switchboard entered into a new agreement with ePresence dated March 1, 2003 to provide telephone service and support only from March 2003 through December 2003 for $62,500. As of both December 31, 2003 and 2002, Switchboard had accrued expenses of $6,000 related to these services. For these services Switchboard paid ePresence $75,000, $131,000 and $29,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
Switchboard leased the space it occupied in 2003 under a sublease it entered into in January 2003, which expired on December 31, 2003. Switchboard leased the space it occupied in 2002 and 2001 under a sublease entered into in January 2001, which expired on December 31, 2002. Under these subleases, Switchboard paid approximately $251,000, $475,000 and $488,000 to ePresence during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and had $19,000 and $43,000 accrued related to the lease as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Previous to the January 2001 sublease agreement, Switchboard paid ePresence rent in an amount that was approximately equal to its pro rata share of ePresence's rent and occupancy costs. Switchboard's share of ePresence's rent and occupancy costs was $51,000 in 2001. In January 2004, Switchboard entered into a new lease agreement with ePresence to lease the space it occupies for a gross annual base rent of $210,000 per year, which expires on September 30, 2005. Minimum lease payments to ePresence are $210,000 and $157,000 in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Switchboard believes that the amounts paid to ePresence under its services agreements and subleases with ePresence are competitive with amounts Switchboard would have paid to outside third parties for the same or similar services and leased space.
 
Certain directors of Switchboard hold positions as officers or directors of ePresence. The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Switchboard is also Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer of ePresence.
 
One director of Switchboard is Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of ePresence. Another director of Switchboard is also a director of ePresence. In 2003, a total of $23,000 was paid in cash and options to purchase a total of 90,000 shares of Switchboard's common stock were granted to these directors for their services. In 2002 and 2001, no compensation was paid to these directors by Switchboard for their services other than option grants under Switchboard's equity incentive plans.
 
K. Restructuring of Viacom Relationship
 
In 1999, Switchboard and Viacom Inc. ("Viacom", formerly CBS Corporation) consummated a number of agreements under which Viacom acquired a 35% equity stake in Switchboard, through the issuance of 7,468,560 shares of Switchboard's common stock and one share of Series E Special Voting Preferred Stock. In exchange, Switchboard received $5,000,000 in cash and the right to receive advertising and promotional value over a term of seven years, across the full range of CBS media properties, as well as those of its radio and outdoor subsidiary, Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. As part of the transactions, Viacom was also issued warrants to purchase up to an additional 1,066,937 shares of Switchboard's common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.00, which would have increased its ownership position in Switchboard to 40% at the time of the transaction. The number of shares of common stock and warrants issued to Viacom were subject to adjustment in the event of certain future issuances of securities by Switchboard.
 
The Advertising and Promotion Agreement dated as of June 30, 1999 among Switchboard, ePresence and Viacom provided advertising with a future value of $95 million to Switchboard over a seven-year period, subject to one year renewals upon the mutual written agreement of Switchboard, ePresence and Viacom. The net present value of the advertising was recorded as a contribution receivable for the common stock issued. The contribution receivable was reduced as Switchboard utilized advertising based on the proportion of advertising provided to the total amount to be provided over the seven-year term.
 
In August 2001, Switchboard entered into a restructuring agreement with Viacom and ePresence, under which, among other things, Switchboard agreed to terminate its right to the placement of advertising on Viacom's CBS properties with an expected net present value of approximately $44,524,000 in exchange for, primarily, the reconveyance by Viacom to Switchboard of 7,488,560 shares of Switchboard's common stock, the cancellation of warrants held by Viacom to purchase 533,469 shares of Switchboard's common stock and the reconveyance to Switchboard of the one outstanding share of Switchboard's series E special voting preferred stock. In addition, as part of the restructuring of Switchboard's relationship with Viacom, Switchboard's license to use specified CBS trademarks terminated on January 26, 2002.
 
On October 26, 2001, Switchboard obtained approval for the restructuring agreement by its stockholders and closed the transactions contemplated by the restructuring agreement. At the closing, the two individuals who had been elected directors by Viacom pursuant to Viacom's rights as the holder of Switchboard's special voting preferred stock resigned as directors of Switchboard. Due to the reduction in the number of outstanding shares of Switchboard's stock associated with the closing, ePresence became Switchboard's majority stockholder, beneficially owning approximately 54% of Switchboard's outstanding stock on October 26, 2001.
 
In connection with the termination of its advertising and promotion agreement with Viacom, Switchboard recorded a one-time, non-cash accounting loss of $22,203,000 in Switchboard's 2001 statement of operations. The non-cash accounting loss resulted from the difference between the net present value of Switchboard's remaining advertising rights with Viacom, which were terminated, and the value of the shares of Switchboard's common and preferred stock that were reconveyed and the warrants that were cancelled. Switchboard determined the value of the 7,488,560 shares of common stock reconveyed and one share of preferred stock cancelled to be $20,968,000 using the closing market price of Switchboard's common stock of $2.80 per share on October 26, 2001. Switchboard used the Black-Scholes warrant pricing model to determine a value of $1,352,544 attributable to the canceled warrants.
 
Subsequently, on February 27, 2002, Viacom exercised its warrant pursuant to a cashless exercise provision in the warrant, resulting in the net issuance of 386,302 shares of common stock. On March 12, 2002, Switchboard repurchased these 386,302 shares of common stock from Viacom at a price of $3.25 per share, for a total cost of $1.3 million. Switchboard recorded the value of these shares as treasury stock at cost.
 
L. Commitments and Contingencies
 
Switchboard leases facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire at various dates through March of 2005. Under these agreements, Switchboard is obligated to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance. Excluding rent paid to ePresence (Note J), Switchboard recorded rent expense of $16,000, $17,000 and $357,000 in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Under various agreements, Switchboard paid rent of approximately $251,000, $475,000 and $539,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001 to ePresence, respectively. In addition, Switchboard has entered into certain license agreements, under which Switchboard is required to pay minimum royalty payments through October 2005 based upon Switchboard's revenue.
 
At December 31, 2003, future minimum lease payments under operating leases, excluding Switchboard's operating lease with ePresence, and license agreements with minimum terms exceeding one year are as follows (in thousands):
 
 
On November 21, 2001, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of Switchboard from March 2, 2000 through December 6, 2000. The complaint named as defendants Switchboard, the managing underwriters of our initial public offering, Douglas J. Greenlaw, Dean Polnerow, and John P. Jewett. Mr. Polnerow is our President and CEO, and Mr. Greenlaw and Mr. Jewett are former officers of Switchboard.
 
An amended complaint was filed on April 20, 2002. The amended complaint alleges violations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, primarily based on the assertion that the defendants made material false and misleading statements in Switchboard's registration statement and prospectus filed with the SEC in connection with Switchboard's initial public offering because of the failure to disclose (a) the alleged solicitation and receipt of excessive and undisclosed commissions by the underwriters in connection with the allocation of shares of common stock to certain investors in Switchboard's public offering and (b) that certain of the underwriters allegedly had entered into agreements with investors whereby underwriters agreed to allocate the public offering shares in exchange for which the investors agreed to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. The amended complaint alleges claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act. The amended complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount.
 
In July 2002, Switchboard, Douglas J. Greenlaw, Dean Polnerow and John P. Jewett joined in an omnibus motion to dismiss challenging the legal sufficiency of plaintiffs' claims. The motion was filed on behalf of hundreds of issuer and individual defendants named in similar lawsuits. The plaintiffs opposed the motion, and the Court heard oral argument on the motion in November 2002. On February 19, 2003, the court issued its decision on the defendants' motion to dismiss, granting in part and denying in part the motion as to Switchboard. In addition, in October 2002, Messrs. Greenlaw, Polnerow and Jewett were dismissed from this case without prejudice.
 
In June 2003, the plaintiffs, the issuer defendants and their insurers agreed on the terms and conditions of a proposed settlement of this case. The terms and conditions of the proposed settlement have been widely reported in the press. Our special committee of the board of directors met twice during June 2003 to evaluate the proposed settlement. The committee was advised by outside counsel on the merits of the proposed settlement. The committee determined that the settlement was in the best interests of Switchboard and that we should accept the proposed settlement. There is no guarantee that the settlement will become final, as it is subject to a number of conditions, including court approval; however, based on this proposed settlement. In the third quarter of 2003, Switchboard was informed by outside counsel that all but two of the non-bankrupt issuers decided to accept the terms and conditions of the proposed settlement of this case. The two issuers who did not accept the proposal were in unique circumstances that do not apply to other issuers. We do not believe we will suffer material future losses related to this lawsuit.
 
Switchboard is currently involved in other legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of its business, none of which it believes could reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on Switchboard's financial condition.
 
M. Income Taxes
 
In 2003, Switchboard did not have a significant tax provision. Switchboard is subject to certain state and federal minimum taxes. Switchboard has not provided for income taxes in each of the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 due to its significant pre-tax losses. Switchboard has not recorded a benefit for income taxes as Switchboard believes it is more likely than not that net operating losses and tax credits will not be fully utilized.
 
A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Company's effective tax rate in 2003 is as follows:
 
 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, Switchboard considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Switchboard believes that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a valuation of $39,940,000 and $40,346,000 for December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, has been established for deferred tax assets. The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) and the related valuation allowance are as follows:
 
 
As of December 31, 2003, Switchboard has net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $87,734,000 and $87,726,000, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2012 and 2003, respectively. A portion of the Company's net operating losses were created by the excess tax benefits associated with stock options and will be realized through increases to stockholders equity when utilized. Ownership changes resulting from Switchboard's issuance of capital stock may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income.
 
N. Stock Option Plans
 
In November 2000, with its acquisition of Envenue, Switchboard adopted the 2000 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan ("2000 Non-Statutory Plan"). A total of 446,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2000 Non-Statutory Plan. As of December 31, 2003, options to purchase 201,908 shares were issued and outstanding under the 2000 Non-Statutory Plan.
 
In October 1999, Switchboard adopted the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1999 Option Plan"). A total of 3,520,916 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1999 Option Plan. As of December 31, 2003, options to purchase 1,804,328 shares were issued and outstanding under the 1999 Option Plan. The 1999 Option Plan also
 
permits awards of restricted stock at a price determined by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors subject to Switchboard's right to repurchase such stock in specified circumstances prior to the expiration of a restricted period. In January 2002, Switchboard issued 450,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Greenlaw, its former Chief Executive Officer, who was also a director of Switchboard, at fair market value (Note R). In September 2003, Mr. Greenlaw ceased to be an employee and resigned as a director. In connection with the separation of employment, Switchboard exercised its right to repurchase 225,000 unvested restricted shares from Mr. Greenlaw. These 225,000 repurchased shares were returned to the 1999 Option Plan.
 
Switchboard also has the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1996 Option Plan"), which provides for the issuance of options to purchase 1,216,800 shares of Switchboard's common stock. As of December 31, 2003, options to purchase 1,216,800 shares were issued and outstanding under the 1996 Option Plan.
 
Generally, options under the 1996, 1999 and 2000 Option Plans vest over four years and have a maximum term of ten years. All options are fully exercisable upon the date of grant into shares of restricted stock, for which the restrictions laps over in accordance with the vesting under the original stock option grant. A summary of the status of Switchboard's stock plans as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and the changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below.
 
 
As of December 31, 2003, 1,716,588 shares and 186,856 shares were available for grant under the 1999 Option Plan and the 2000 Non-Statutory Plan, respectively. There were no shares available for grant under the 1996 Option Plan.
 
The following table summarizes information about the stock options at December 31, 2003:
 
 
In June 2001, Switchboard issued to a director and officer of Switchboard options to purchase 150,000 shares of its common stock under the 1999 Option Plan at a price below market value. Switchboard recorded $437,000 in value resulting from the difference between the market value on the date of grant of $3.91 per share and the $1.00 per share exercise price as unearned compensation as a component of Stockholders' Equity. Switchboard is amortizing this amount over the two-year and nine-month vesting period. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, Switchboard recognized $146,000, $156,000 and $102,000 of amortization expense, respectively.
 
In 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"). A total of 300,000 shares of Switchboard's common stock have been reserved for issuance to eligible employees under the Purchase Plan. Under the Purchase Plan, Switchboard is authorized to make a series of offerings during which employees may purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions made over the term of the offering. The per-share purchase price at the end of each offering is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period (as defined by the Purchase Plan), whichever is lower. As of December 31, 2003, 150,428 shares of common stock were issued under the Purchase Plan.
 
O. Capital Lease
 
In March 2001, Switchboard entered into a computer equipment sale-leaseback agreement with Fleet Capital Corporation ("FCC") under which Switchboard was able to lease up to $3.0 million of equipment. Under the agreement, Switchboard was to have leased computer equipment over a three-year period ending on June 28, 2004. At December 31, 2001, Switchboard had utilized approximately $1.1 million of this lease facility. The agreement had an estimated effective annual percentage rate of approximately 7.90%. Under the terms of the agreement, Switchboard was required to maintain on deposit with Fleet a compensating balance, restricted as to use, in an amount equal to the principal outstanding under the lease. Switchboard had accounted for the transaction as a capital lease.
 
In May 2002, Switchboard paid $794,000 to FCC to terminate its lease obligations with FCC through an early buy-out. The $794,000 was comprised of $764,000 in outstanding principal under the lease and $30,000 in expenses associated with the early termination. In exchange for the amount paid, Switchboard assumed all right and title to the assets leased under the facility. Additionally, Switchboard's requirement to maintain a compensating balance with Fleet was eliminated.
 
P. Notes Payable and Line of Credit
 
In June 2002, Switchboard entered into a loan and security agreement (the "SVB Financing Agreement") with Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB"), under which Switchboard was able to borrow up to $4.0 million for the purchase of equipment. Amounts borrowed under the facility accrued interest at a rate equal to prime plus 0.25%, and were to have been repaid monthly over a 30-month period. Switchboard had utilized $2.7 million of this facility through borrowings that occurred in June 2002 and September 2002. Switchboard recorded a note payable to SVB on its balance sheet totaling $2.2 million for the equipment financed as of December 31, 2002, of which $1.1 million was classified as a current liability. The SVB Financing Agreement also provided for a $1.0 million revolving line of credit at an interest rate equal to prime. Switchboard did not borrow any amounts under the revolving line of credit. Switchboard's ability to borrow additional amounts under the SVB Financing Agreement expired on May 30, 2003 after Switchboard chose not to renew the agreement. In May 2003, Switchboard paid SVB $1.8 million in satisfaction of its outstanding borrowings under the loan facility.
 
Q. Special Credits and Charges
 
In 2003, Switchboard recorded the reversal of $35,000 of excess restructuring reserves as a special credit. The 2003 reversal resulted primarily from a change in estimate with respect to a compensation amount for a terminated employee that had been provided for as part of the Company's 2001 special charges. In 2002, Switchboard recorded the reversal of $262,000 in excess restructuring reserves as a special credit. The 2002 reversal resulted primarily from better than expected results in the subleasing of idle office space which Switchboard had reserved for as part of its 2002 special charges. Under a non-cancelable sublease, Switchboard received $156,000 and $72,000 in 2003 and 2002, and anticipates receiving $132,000 and $60,000 in 2004 and 2005, respectively.
 
In December 2001, Switchboard recorded net pre-tax special charges of approximately $17.3 million, comprised primarily of $15.6 million for the impairment of certain assets, $1.0 million for costs related to facility closures and $700,000 in severance costs related to the reduction of approximately 21% of Switchboard's workforce. The restructuring resulted in 21 employee separations.
 
Included in the $15.6 million impairment charge for certain assets is $11.7 million recorded for the impairment of the unamortized portion of the value of the common stock issued and amounts prepaid to AOL. Switchboard assessed the value of its assets related to its AOL Directory Agreement for impairment as it had a current period operating loss combined with a history of operating losses with respect to its AOL relationship and revenues were lower at the end of the first year of the Directory Agreement than originally anticipated and Switchboard had incurred a current period and historical operating loss with respect to its AOL business. This analysis was performed as part of Switchboard's restatement of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001, which occurred in September 2002. However, in performing this impairment analysis, Switchboard was unable to utilize the more favorable financial terms of the April 2002 and August 2002 amendments as they had occurred subsequent to the date Switchboard had filed its original Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 (March 2002). The financial terms of the April 2002 and August 2002 amendments were developments that occurred subsequent to the March 2002 filing and, in accordance with existing accounting standards, could not be considered. If Switchboard had been able to utilize the more favorable financial terms resulting from the April 2002 and August 2002 amendments, its AOL assets may have been considered to be fully recoverable.
 
Switchboard's impairment analysis, utilizing the estimated cash flow approach, included certain revenue and expense assumptions through December 2004, the expiration date of the Directory Agreement. Switchboard assumed annual revenue growth rates of 77%, 135% and 85% under the agreement in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Switchboard's expense assumptions included contractually fixed payments of $39.0 million; a total of $4.8 million of value associated with two additional contractual stock issuances to AOL of 746,260 shares each, which were to have occurred in December 2002 and 2003; and an estimate of other costs and expenses Switchboard would incur to support the relationship with AOL. Switchboard's analysis indicated that the AOL assets were impaired due to the fact that the projected future cash flows from AOL over the remainder of the term of the agreement were insufficient to support the value of the AOL related assets. Switchboard then measured impairment by performing an analysis of the discounted future cash flows under the Directory Agreement using a discount factor of 20% per year. This discounted cash flow analysis indicated that the AOL related assets were fully impaired as of December 31, 2001. Accordingly, a charge of $11.7 million was recorded as an additional component of special charges during 2001.
 
In December 2001, Switchboard exercised its rights under the Envenue acquisition agreement to substantially reduce the funding of Envenue. Switchboard evaluated the carrying value of its goodwill in Envenue, and determined it would not be fully recovered through estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows. As a result, in 2001 Switchboard recorded as a component of the $15.6 million impairment charge, $1.9 million related to the Envenue goodwill. The impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded the present value of the estimated discounted future cash flows attributable to these assets.
 
Also included in the impairment charge for certain assets are amounts related to prepaid advertising expenses. As a result of Switchboard's change in overall strategy from a destination site to a technology provider, Switchboard no longer considered this prepaid advertising to be complementary to its corporate strategy. Accordingly, Switchboard recorded $1.4 million for the impairment of these prepaid advertising assets.
 
Of the total $1.3 million facilities and severance charge, which is net of the $35,000 and $262,000 special credits recorded in 2003 and 2002, approximately $1.1 million was cash related. Switchboard has a remaining liability of $10,000 on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 relating to the special charges.
 
R. Note Receivable for the Issuance of Restricted Common Stock
 
In January 2002, Switchboard recorded a note receivable from Mr. Greenlaw, its Chief Executive Officer, who was also a member of its Board of Directors, for approximately $1.4 million arising from the financing of a purchase of 450,000 shares of its common stock as restricted stock by Mr. Greenlaw. As of December 31, 2002, 300,000 of such shares were unvested and restricted from transfer. On each of January 4, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, 75,000 of these restricted shares were to have vested, respectively. The note bore interest at a rate of 4.875%, which was deemed to be fair market value, compounding annually and was 100% recourse as to principal and interest. The note was payable upon the earlier of the occurrence of the sale of all or part of the shares by the issuer of the note, or January 4, 2008. During 2003 and 2002, Switchboard recorded $56,000 and $71,000 in interest income resulting from this note receivable. At December 31, 2002, Switchboard had recorded $1.5 million in principal and interest as a note receivable classified within stockholders' equity.
 
Mr. Greenlaw ceased to be an employee and resigned as a director effective September 2, 2003. In connection with Mr. Greenlaw's separation of employment, Switchboard recorded, as a component of general and administrative expense, certain separation expenses of $174,000 in 2003 in accordance with Mr. Greenlaw's employment agreement. At the time Mr. Greenlaw ceased to be affiliated with Switchboard, 225,000 of the original 450,000 shares granted were vested. In September 2003, Switchboard exercised its right to repurchase the remaining 225,000 unvested shares for $725,000, resulting in a corresponding reduction in the outstanding note of $725,000. In accordance with the terms of the note, Mr. Greenlaw repaid the note payable and all accrued interest outstanding to Switchboard in full through payments totaling $851,000. The final payment was received in November 2003.

T. Subsequent Event
 
On March 26, 2004, Switchboard announced a definitive agreement to be acquired by InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace"). In connection with the transaction, all of the outstanding shares of Switchboard will be converted into a right to receive $7.75 per share in cash, without interest, and Switchboard will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of InfoSpace. The completion of the transaction is subject to several conditions, including shareholder and regulatory approval.

Revenues for the second quarter of 2004 were $54.4 million, reflecting a $22.8 million (or 72%) increase over the second quarter of 2003. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2004 was $13.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, versus a net loss from continuing operations of $16.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2003. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a net gain of $3.7 million as part of operating income, which primarily relates to a gain from the settlement of a litigation matter.
 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments at June 30, 2004 totaled approximately $293 million. The Company had no debt obligations at the end of the quarter.
 
"We had a tremendous quarter and are once again raising guidance for 2004," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "We had substantial growth in revenue and cash flow from our search distribution, directory and mobile businesses. With the acquisitions of Switchboard and Atlas Mobile as well as new business with Verizon Wireless and Dex Media, we are capitalizing on the expanding opportunities in our markets."

Search & Directory
 
Search & Directory revenues were $34.4 million in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of $13.0 million or 61% from the second quarter of 2003.

The Section 16(b) lawsuit was brought against a former officer and director of the Company and other defendants by the same private party shareholder on behalf of InfoSpace. As such, the derivative and Section 16(b) lawsuits did not seek monetary damages from, or the imposition of remedies on, the Company. Subject to final approval by the King County Superior Court and the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington for the derivative lawsuit and the Section 16(b) lawsuit, respectively, settlement proceeds, net of plaintiff's counsel's fee and certain costs, will be paid to the Company pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.

Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled to income from continuing operations, which the Company believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance. This non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.

Item 1.01
 
On January 24, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the InfoSpace, Inc. Board of Directors approved the 2005 InfoSpace Executive Financial Performance Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan"). The 2005 Plan provides for the payment of cash bonuses to eligible senior executives, which include the chairman and chief executive officer; president and chief operating officer; chief financial officer; chief administrative officer; chief strategy officer; executive vice presidents; and certain senior vice presidents. The payment of these cash bonuses is based upon the attainment of specific revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) objectives established by the Compensation Committee. Revenue and EBITDA targets are identified for the year for the business unit or for the corporation as a whole, depending on the role of the executive. These revenue and EBITDA targets have not been included in this description or in the 2005 Plan in order to maintain the confidentiality of InfoSpace's confidential commercial or business information.
 
The above description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the 2005 Plan which is filed as Exhibit 10.20 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 9.01
 
(c) EXHIBITS.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: January 27, 2005
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.20
 
 
This plan document outlines the 2005 InfoSpace Executive Financial Performance Incentive Plan ("the Plan").
 
Rationale
 
 
 
 
 
Effective date
 
This plan is effective January 1, 2005. However, the Plan may be changed at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at any time.
 
Participation Eligibility
 
Senior executives covered by an written employment agreement including Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; President and Chief Operating Officer; Chief Financial Officer; Chief Strategy Officer; Chief Administrative Officer; Executive Vice Presidents; and certain Senior Vice Presidents.
 
Payout Eligibility
 
In order to be eligible for a bonus payout, participants are required to meet or exceed MBO goals and be employed for the performance period. The Compensation Committee has full discretion to pay out partial bonuses if MBO's are partially met.
 
Target
 
The target percentage is determined in the Compensation Committee's discretion based on a combination of factors including current year plan challenges and risks, market-place pay competitiveness and past performance of incumbent.
 
Elements
 
The elements measured to determine the incentive earned are:
 
 
 
Revenue and EBITDA targets are identified for the year for business unit or for the corporation as a whole depending on the role of the executive.
 
Financial Criteria Payout Calculation
 
The specific Revenue and EBITDA objectives that reflect levels of performance are set by the Compensation Committee and will be individually communicated. These specific financial objectives may change at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee anticipates a mid-year review of all financial targets.
 
The payout scenarios are illustrated below.
 
 
There is no payout if the financial targets are not at least 90% achieved.
 
Performance results are rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point.
 
Bonus payments for the Chairman/CEO, President/COO, CFO, CAO and CSO are paid annually and are subject to Compensation Committee approval. Incentives will be paid out for other participants quarterly, typically 2 paycheck cycles after the financial close of a quarter. These payments will be made in accordance with this plan document and paid without additional Compensation Committee review, unless there is a request to deviate from this plan.
 
New Hires
 
The incentive will be pro-rated to reflect date of hire.
 
Terminations, Transfers, Leave of Absence
 
If an executive resigns on good terms, is terminated for good reason, or takes an approved leave of absence during the performance period, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay out a partial bonus if the executive worked a significant portion of a performance period and achieved the majority of the MBO's, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement.

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Factors that could affect InfoSpace's actual results include general economic, industry and market sector conditions, the progress and costs of the development of our products and services, the timing and extent of market acceptance of those products and services, our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives. A more detailed description of certain factors that could affect actual results include, but are not limited to, those discussed in InfoSpace's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as filed from time to time, in the section entitled "Factors Affecting Our Operating Results, Business Prospects and Market Price of Stock."

For each of the business segments, Search & Directory and Mobile, the financial information above is used by the Company's chief operating decision maker.
 
 
 
 
 
Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled to income from continuing operations, which the Company believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance. This non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.
 
(1)
As presented in the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Income.
 
(2)
Other income, net, primarily consists of the settlement of a certain litigation matter, interest income, gains or losses from the disposal of assets, and foreign currency gains or losses.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
Item 9.01
 
(c) EXHIBITS.
 
99.1     Press Release, dated July 26, 2005
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: July 26, 2005
 
 
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2005.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (July 26, 2005)
 
Revenues for the second quarter of 2005 were $83.2 million, reflecting an increase of 53 percent over revenues of $54.4 million in the second quarter of 2004. Net income for the second quarter of 2005 was $16.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to net income of $13.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments at June 30, 2005, totaled approximately $407 million, an increase of approximately $23 million from the first quarter of 2005. At the end of the second quarter, the Company had no debt obligations.
 
"InfoSpace delivered revenue within our expectations and strong bottom-line results," said Jim Voelker, chairman and CEO of InfoSpace. "However, given current trends, we anticipate revenues to decline in the third quarter and to grow in the fourth quarter. In the second half of the year, we will continue to invest in new products that leverage our unique search and mobile assets."
 
Second Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
 
 
 
 
 
Segment Information and Adjusted EBITDA
 
Segment income for each reportable operating segment does not include allocations for general, administrative and other overhead costs, depreciation, amortization, restructuring and other charges and non-operating gains or losses.
 
Search & Directory
 
Search & Directory revenues were $46.1 million in the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $11.7 million or 34 percent from the second quarter 2004. The increase in revenue is due to growth in total paid searches, as well as growth in average revenue per paid search. During the quarter, total paid searches in North America for both search and directory were approximately 214 million. Average revenue per paid search was approximately $0.18, an increase of 13 percent over the prior year second quarter. Search & Directory segment income was $20.3 million or 44 percent of revenues for the second quarter of 2005.
 
Mobile
 
Mobile revenues were $37.1 million in the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $17.0 million or 85 percent from the second quarter of 2004. The increase in revenue is due to year-over-year growth in the Company's media download business. Mobile segment income totaled $8.3 million or 22 percent of revenues for the second quarter of 2005.
 
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA")
 
Adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million in the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $7.1 million or 59 percent from the prior year second quarter. The Adjusted EBITDA results should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in this release. InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA results are calculated by adjusting income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP to exclude the effects of interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, litigation settlements, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets, as detailed in the accompanying table.
 
Outlook
 
The Company's guidance excludes the gain from the first quarter litigation settlement and the potential impact of any one-time gains or losses. The Adjusted EBITDA guidance below has been prepared in a manner consistent with the historical Adjusted EBITDA data provided above and a table reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to net income in accordance with GAAP is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.
 
If the Company is able to achieve a certain level of profitability during the second half of 2005, absent other business factors, the Company may reduce the reserve on its deferred tax asset. The impact of reducing the reserve would provide a one-time income tax benefit in the period it is reduced and the Company would then begin recording an income tax expense, which would be substantially non-cash due to the Company's net operating loss carry-forwards. The Company's guidance has assumed an effective income tax rate of 38 percent in determining its income tax expense in the fourth quarter.
Third Quarter 2005 Outlook
 
For the third quarter of 2005, the Company expects revenue to be between $75.0 million and $80.0 million. The Company expects that Adjusted EBITDA will be between $9.0 million and $11.0 million; net income to be between $5.5 million and $7.5 million; and fully diluted earnings per share to be between $0.15 and $0.20.
 
Full Year 2005 Outlook
 
For full year 2005, the Company is revising its revenue guidance to be between $330.0 million and $340.0 million. This is revised from prior guidance of $375.0 million and $395.0 million. The Company expects that Adjusted EBITDA will be between $62.0 and $67.0 million, net income to be between $44.0 million and $47.0 million, and fully diluted earnings per share to be between $1.15 and $1.25 (assuming an effective income tax rate of 38 percent in the fourth quarter). This is revised from prior guidance which expected Adjusted EBITDA to be between $92.0 and $100.0 million, net income to be between $67.0 million and $75.0 million, and fully diluted earnings per share to be between $1.75 and $1.95.
 
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific/ 5 p.m. Eastern. The live Webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate Web site, at . A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the call through August 4, 2005, at 10:00 p.m. Pacific.

Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled to income from continuing operations, which the Company believes to be the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance. This non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.

"The opportunity to lead InfoSpace's expanding mobile media enterprise captivated me from the start," said Mr. Davis. "Jim Voelker and his team have built a truly compelling mobile content library and paired it with major carrier relationships in North America and Europe. InfoSpace is the first company addressing the greater role of content programming in the mobile space, and I am thrilled to lead the company's mobile media business to the next level."

The company produced and distributed one of the largest slates of made-for-television movies in the industry and produced a number of top rated television series, including "Hell's Kitchen" and "Nanny 911" for FOX, "Hit Me Baby One More Time" for NBC, "Room Raiders" for MTV, "Celebrity Fit Club" for VH1 and "Airline" for A&E.
 
Prior to joining Granada America, Mr. Davis was president and CEO of Carlton America, which later merged with Granada.

"I've worked with Kathy Rae for many years and she has done an outstanding job at InfoSpace," said Voelker.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2005.
BELLEVUE, Wash. October 25, 2005
 
Revenues for the third quarter of 2005 were $83.2 million, reflecting an increase of 24 percent over revenues of $67.2 million in the third quarter of 2004. Net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $11.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to net income of $13.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments as of September 30, 2005 totaled approximately $362 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 2.0 million shares at a total cost of $51.2 million. At the end of the quarter, the Company had no debt obligations.
 
"We are pleased with our third quarter results," said David Rostov, chief financial officer of InfoSpace. "We continue to execute against initiatives that enhance our position in mobile and leverage our unique combination of search and mobile assets."
 
Third Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
 
 
 
 
 
Segment Information and Adjusted EBITDA
 
Segment income for each reportable operating segment does not include allocations for general, administrative and other overhead costs, depreciation, amortization, restructuring and other charges and non-operating gains or losses.
 
Search & Directory
Search & Directory revenues were $44.2 million in the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $2.2 million or 5 percent from the third quarter of 2004. During the quarter, total paid searches in North America for both search and directory were approximately 182 million. Average revenue per paid search was approximately $0.20, an increase of 18 percent over the prior year third quarter. Search & Directory segment income was $16.5 million or 37 percent of revenues for the third quarter of 2005.
 
Mobile
Mobile revenues were $39.0 million in the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $13.9 million or 55 percent from the third quarter of 2004. The increase in revenue is due to year-over-year growth in the Company's media download business. Mobile segment income totaled $6.8 million or 18 percent of revenues for the third quarter of 2005.
 
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA")
Adjusted EBITDA was $14.0 million in the third quarter of 2005, a decrease of $3.1 million or 18 percent from the prior year third quarter. The Adjusted EBITDA results should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP is included in a table accompanying the condensed consolidated financial statements in this release. InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA results are calculated by adjusting income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP to exclude the effects of interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, litigation settlements, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets, as detailed in the accompanying table.
 
Outlook
 
Fourth Quarter 2005 Outlook
For the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company expects revenue to be between $84 million and $86 million. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be between $13 million and $14 million, net income to be between $9 million and $10 million, and fully diluted earnings per share to be between $0.25 and $0.28.
 
Full Year 2005 Outlook
For full year 2005, the Company expects revenue to be between $337 million and $339 million. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be between $68 million and $69 million, net income to be between $53 million and $54 million, and fully diluted earnings per share to be between $1.46 and $1.49.
 
The Company's guidance excludes the gain from the first quarter litigation settlement and the potential impact of any one-time gains or losses. The Adjusted EBITDA guidance has been prepared in a manner consistent with the historical Adjusted EBITDA data provided above and in the accompanying table.
If the Company is able to achieve continued profitability during the fourth quarter of 2005, absent other business factors, the Company may reduce the reserve on its deferred tax asset. The impact of reducing the reserve would provide a one-time income tax benefit in the period it is reduced and the Company would then begin recording an income tax expense, which would be substantially non-cash due to the Company's net operating loss carry-forwards. The Company's guidance excludes any impact from this potential tax matter.
 
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific/ 5 p.m. Eastern. The live Webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate Web site, at . A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the call through November 3, 2005, at 10:00 p.m. Pacific.

This release contains forward-looking statements relating to InfoSpace, Inc.'s products and services and future operating results that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. The words "believe," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward looking. Forward-looking statements include without limitation statements regarding the projected results of the
Company's strategic plan and efforts to achieve long-term sustainable growth; projected financial performance for the Company for the fourth quarter and full year 2005; and material reductions of the reserve on its deferred tax asset. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Factors that could affect InfoSpace's actual results include general economic, industry and market sector conditions, the progress and costs of the development of our products and services, the timing and extent of market acceptance of those products and services, our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives. A more detailed description of certain factors that could affect actual results include, but are not limited to, those discussed in InfoSpace's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on form 10-Q as filed from time to time, in the section entitled "Factors Affecting Our Operating Results, Business Prospects and Market Price of Stock." Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release.

For each of the business segments, Search & Directory and Mobile, the financial information above is used by the Company's chief operating decision maker.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled to income from continuing operations, which the Company believes to be the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance. This non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled to income from continuing operations, which the Company believes to be the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance. This non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.

The eligible positions for 2006 will be:
 
 
 
 
 
If the executive leadership team changes composition, any additions will be recommended by the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee.
PERFORMANCE PERIODS
The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer will be paid annually. The remaining executives will be paid semi-annually.
BONUS TARGETS
The participant's annual bonus target will be 75% of annual base salary. The bonus target will be determined at the Compensation Committee's discretion based on a combination of factors including current-year operating plan challenges and risks, market pay competitiveness, and the past performance of the incumbent. The bonus target will also be set in accordance with the participant's employment agreement.
PLAN DESIGN
The Plan will have the following financial bonus components with the associated weightings, measurement periods, payment scales, and bonus achievement percentages:
 
Revenue and EBITDA Financial Performance Bonuses
Revenue and EBITDA targets will be established and measured on a consolidated, worldwide basis. The bonus plan financial targets will match the 2006 operating plan targets approved by the Board of Directors in December 2005.
 
2006 Executive Financial Performance Incentive Plan
The bonus payment scale below will be used to calculate the revenue and EBITDA bonuses on a quarterly basis.
 
 
 
 
Financial bonus amounts will be calculated and accrued on a quarterly basis, but final bonus payment amounts will be determined on a semi-annual basis. Actual bonus payments will be made in accordance with the performance periods on page one.
Individual Performance: MBO Achievement
Executives must achieve individual performance objectives (MBOs) to receive full bonus payments. Each executive will have 3-5 MBOs tied to bonus eligibility within each six-month performance period. The Compensation Committee will review and approve the MBOs for each executive at the beginning of the performance period.
 
 
Bonus Calculation Example
An example is illustrated below for a Plan participant who has a semi-annual performance period, a 75% bonus target, and an annualized base salary of $225,000.
 
The semi-annual bonus payments would then be calculated as follows on the next page, depending upon MBO bonus achievement.
 
2006 Executive Financial Performance Incentive Plan
 
Semiannual bonus payments will be made in August 2006 and February 2007. For participants with annual performance periods, similar calculations will be made for each of the two semi-annual periods. For the annual participants, the two semi-annual bonus payments will be added together and paid out in February 2007.
EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
In order to be eligible for a bonus payment under the Plan, participants must be employed for the entire performance period.
If an executive resigns on good terms, exercises termination for good reason, or takes an approved leave of absence during the performance period, the CEO has the discretion to recommend to the Compensation Committee to pay a partial bonus if the executive worked a significant portion of a performance period and achieved the majority of the MBO's, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement.
For executives who join the company after the beginning of a performance period but before the last 60 days of it, he or she may be eligible for pro-rated participation at the sole discretion of the CEO.
APPROVAL
All bonus payments made to executives will be submitted to the Compensation Committee for final approval. The Compensation Committee may adjust the final bonus amount as it deems appropriate. The Committee has complete discretion to adjust bonus awards to reflect changes in the industry, company, the executive's job duties or performance, or any other circumstance the Committee determines should impact bonus awards.

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION TARGET
The EVP's total incentive compensation target will be 125% of base salary.

PLAN DESIGN
The Plan will have the following incentive compensation components with the associated weightings, measurement periods, payment scales, and achievement percentages:
 
REVENUE BONUS
The EVP will earn a revenue bonus based on his achievement of the targets. Revenue bonus amounts will be calculated and accrued on a quarterly basis, but final revenue payments will be determined and made on a semi-annual basis. The revenue bonus amounts for Q1 & Q2 and for Q3 & Q4 will be added together to form a total semi-annual payment, with the final payment amount dependent upon MBO achievement.
For revenue achievement up to 100% of target, the company's executive bonus scale on the following page will be used to determine the EVP's revenue bonus. However, for revenue achievement that is greater that 100%, the EVP will receive additional bonus amounts in accordance with the following schedule:
 
 
2006 EVP, Sales & Business Development Compensation Plan
The sum of these overachievement amounts across the different ranges will be added to the target bonus amount to yield the quarterly revenue bonus amount.
Here is the revenue bonus scale for achievement up to 100% of target:
 
 
 
The quarterly revenue bonus for performance up to 100% of target will be equal to:
 
EBITDA BONUS

EBITDA targets will be established and measured on a consolidated, worldwide basis. The bonus payment scale below will be used to calculate the EBITDA bonuses on a quarterly basis.

Semiannual bonus payments will be made in August 2006 and February 2007.
EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

e. During the construction process, Fisher, Customer and Contractor shall meet at least once per week at the job site to review construction progress and all other matters as may be appropriate in connection with the Tenant Improvements.
 
a. It is agreed that Customer's obligation to pay Fees as called for under the Agreement shall not commence until Fisher has Substantially Completed all work to be performed by Fisher as set forth on the Final Agreed Plans. As used herein, "Substantial Completion" shall mean the completion of Fisher's construction obligations with respect to the Tenant Improvements in accordance with the Final Agreed Plans and otherwise as set forth in this Work Letter Agreement, subject to completion or correction of "punch list" items, that is, minor items of incomplete or defective work or materials or mechanical maladjustments that are of such a nature that they do not materially interfere with or impair Customer's use of the Co-Location Space for its permitted use. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Tenant Improvements shall not be deemed "substantially complete" and the Commencement Date shall not be deemed to occur until the following conditions shall have been satisfied by Fisher:
(i) The utility and other systems servicing the Building and necessary for the operation of the Customer's occupancy and full enjoyment of the Co-Location Space (such as elevators, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, electrical and security systems) shall be completed and in good order and operating condition except for details of construction, decoration and mechanical adjustments which do not materially interfere with Customer's use of the Co-Location Space;
(ii) The project architect shall have certified to Customer that the Tenant Improvements have been completed, subject to completion of "punch-list" items, in accordance with the Final Agreed Plans;
(iii) Fisher shall have obtained final inspections and necessary "sign-offs" on all permits required for the Tenant Improvements.
The occurrence of the Commencement Date prior to the completion in full of all work required to be performed by Fisher as provided herein shall not relieve Fisher of its obligation thereafter to complete the same with due dispatch and in a workmanlike manner. In the event Fisher is actually delayed in Substantially Completing said work as a result of (i) Customer's failure to timely furnish information required by and in accordance with the requirements of this Work Letter Agreement; (ii) Customer's request for materials, finishes, or installations other than Building Standard; (iii) Customer's changes to the initial design concepts, the Plans and Specifications or the Final Agreed Plans, or, (iv) as a result of any other act or failure to act on the part of Customer which actually delays the completion of the work, then such delay shall not alter the Agreement Commencement Date nor the Customer's obligations under the Agreement.
b. Fisher shall make reasonable efforts to complete the Tenant Improvements by the Agreement Commencement Date. However, Fisher shall not be held liable for any damages incurred by Customer in the event of a delay due to strikes, governmental regulations, acts of God, or any other causes beyond Fisher's control.
 
This Work Letter Agreement and the subsequent Final Agreed Plans shall constitute the complete construction specifications and no other representations, or oral agreements between the parties shall be recognized in the event of a dispute between Fisher and Customer.
Time is of the essence with respect to each of the duties and obligations of Fisher and Customer set forth in this Work Letter Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions hereof, default by Customer or Fisher under any provisions of this Work Letter Agreement which are not cured within applicable notice and cure periods set forth in the Agreement shall constitute a default under the Agreement.
 
as of the date and year first set forth above.
AGREED TO AND ACCEPTED

EXHIBIT 99.1
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2006.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (April 26, 2006)
Revenues for the first quarter of 2006 were a record $90.3 million, reflecting an increase of $3.3 million or four percent over the previous high of $87.0 million in the first quarter of 2005.
Net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $3.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to net income of $93.9 million, or $2.52 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005. Net income in the first quarter of 2005 included a net gain of $77.3 million from the settlement of certain litigation matters and net income in the first quarter of 2006 includes a $4.1 million deduction for stock compensation expense.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments at March 31, 2006, totaled approximately $395.6 million, an increase of approximately $20.2 million from the end of 2005. At the end of the first quarter, the Company had no debt obligations.
"InfoSpace had an exciting quarter, delivering strong results and record revenues fueled by strength in media downloads and online search," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc. "Just as important, we are successfully executing on our strategic initiatives including the deployment of two new mobile search products. Our search applications are now available on three of the four major carriers in North America."
First Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
 
 
 
 
 
 
First Quarter Segment Information and Adjusted EBITDA
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in its organization. The Company continues to present revenue from its two segments, Mobile and Online, consistent with historical presentation. Additionally, the Company will present segment gross profit, which is segment revenues net of respective content and distribution costs.
 
 
The historical segment results for the first quarter of 2005 through the first quarter of 2006 are presented in the accompanying table to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA")
Adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2006, a decrease of $9.2 million from the first quarter of 2005 Adjusted EBITDA of $21.9 million. InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, litigation settlements, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of our core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and the investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income in accordance with GAAP accompanies the condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.
Outlook
The Company's guidance excludes the potential impact of any future one-time gains or losses. The Adjusted EBITDA guidance below has been prepared in a manner consistent with the historical Adjusted EBITDA data provided above and in the accompanying table.
Second Quarter 2006 Outlook
For the second quarter of 2006, the Company expects revenue to be between $90.0 million and $92.0 million. The Company expects that Adjusted EBITDA will be between $5.0 million and $6.0 million, and a net loss between $2.0 million and $3.0 million or $0.06 and $0.10 per share. Included in the net loss outlook is the impact of approximately $6.5 million of stock compensation expense.

InfoSpace's total revenue for the same period was $186.1 million. The Company plans to rationalize its costs to align them with expected future revenues. Specific plans will be announced within 30 days.

On October 3, 2006, InfoSpace, Inc. and Edmund O. Belsheim, Jr., the Company's Chief Administrative Officer, reached an agreement whereby Mr. Belsheim's employment with the Company will terminate as of January 1, 2007, as part of the restructuring discussed in Item 2.05 of this current report on Form 8-K. Pursuant to the termination agreement and the terms of the Employment Agreement dated as of April 2, 2003, as amended December 9, 2004 between InfoSpace and Mr. Belsheim, and subject to the execution of a release by Mr. Belsheim of the Company from any claims that existed or may have existed at any time up to the date of separation (with the exception of any claims arising under the Indemnification Agreement between the Company and Mr. Belsheim, which remains in full effect, and certain other categories of claims enumerated in the Employment Agreement), Mr. Belsheim will receive a severance payment of $1 million, less lawful and required withholdings. Pursuant to the terms of his Employment Agreement, Mr. Belsheim will also receive twelve months of paid COBRA health benefits and acceleration of certain outstanding stock options for which he will have twelve months to exercise.
 
On September 20, 2006, InfoSpace, Inc. announced that it had been informed by one of its carrier partners that the carrier plans to develop direct licensing relationships with the major record labels beginning in early 2007 and that, accordingly, the Company expects its revenues, as well as its operating results, to be negatively impacted by these direct relationships. The Company also announced that it plans to rationalize its costs to align them with expected future revenues and that specific plans would be announced within 30 days.
On October 10, 2006, InfoSpace announced the following restructuring plan. The Company expects that the plan, which includes a reduction in workforce and consolidation of certain facilities, will align costs with expected future revenues. The plan was committed to on September 29, 2006, and employees began to be notified October 3, 2006.
Including the reductions in its workforce and the consolidation of its operations previously disclosed with respect to the closure of its Hamburg, Germany facility, InfoSpace will eliminate approximately 250 positions, which will take place over time through mid-2007. As a result of these cost-cutting measures, InfoSpace estimates that it will record pre-tax cash restructuring charges, including previously disclosed charges related to the closure of the Hamburg, Germany facility, in the third quarter of 2006 of approximately $6.5 million for severance costs, approximately $1.5 million for exiting excess facilities and losses in the range of $4.5 million to $5.5 million for termination of commitments under certain agreements, and a non-cash, pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $1 million for property, equipment and other charges. Additionally, the Company anticipates recording a non-cash, pre-tax restructuring charge for intangible assets, including goodwill, in the third quarter of 2006. The Company is currently determining an estimate for these non-cash charges and will file an amended report on Form 8-K when it makes a final determination of the estimate.
The Company expects to record additional pre-tax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2006 and through mid-2007, potentially up to $2 million in cash. Potential future charges include approximately $0.8 million for severance costs and approximately $1.2 million for additional excess facilities that the Company has not yet ceased using as of September 30, 2006.
This current report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements relating to InfoSpace, Inc.'s products and services and future operating results, its anticipated revenue loss, planned reduction in force, expected and estimated restructuring charges, and an executive's transition, that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Factors that could affect InfoSpace's actual results include general economic, industry and market sector conditions, the progress and costs of the development of our products and services, our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, the successful execution of the Company's strategic and operational initiatives, including rationalizing costs, and decisions made by our customers and partners to use our products and services.

Specifically, as a result of the restructuring plan the Company has recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2006 a non-cash charge for intangible assets of $44.5 million, consisting of $31.9 million for goodwill and $12.6 million for other intangible assets. The Company also expects to record between approximately $3 million to $4 million in additional pre-tax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2006 through mid-2007, including approximately $0.9 million to $1.3 million in cash for severance costs, approximately $1.25 million to $1.7 million in cash for additional excess facilities that the Company has not yet ceased using as of September 30, 2006 and for termination of commitments under certain agreements, and approximately $0.85 million to $1 million in non-cash charges for stock compensation. In the aggregate, the Company estimates that it will incur a total of between $60.8 million and $61.8 million in total costs in connection with the restructuring, including the $57.8 million recorded as of September 30, 2006, and the potential $3 million to $4 million in additional costs discussed above.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2006.
BELLEVUE, Wash. (November 1, 2006)
Revenues for the third quarter of 2006 were $96.3 million, reflecting an increase of $13.1 million or 16 percent over the third quarter 2005.
During the quarter, the Company announced the loss of a significant portion of business with one of its carrier partners beginning in early 2007. Accordingly, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to rationalize costs and align them with expected revenues.
Net loss in the third quarter was $46.7 million, or $1.49 per share, compared to net income of $11.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005. The net loss in the third quarter of 2006 includes a restructuring charge of $57.8 million, which includes $44.5 million of non-cash charges related to intangible assets. Additionally, the Company recorded a $4.8 million deduction for stock-based compensation expense.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments at September 30, 2006 totaled $411.0 million, an increase of $4.0 million from June 30, 2006. At the end of the third quarter, the Company had no debt obligations.
"We've taken quick action to address the disappointing loss of business, aligning costs with future revenues to continue building on the strong foundation we have in mobile technology and online and mobile discovery," said Jim Voelker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of InfoSpace, Inc.
Third Quarter Segment Information and Adjusted EBITDA
Mobile
Mobile revenues were $47.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $8.7 million or 22 percent from the third quarter of 2005. Mobile gross profit totaled $18.2 million or 38 percent of mobile revenue for the third quarter of 2006.
Online
Online revenues were $48.6 million in the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $4.4 million or 10 percent from the third quarter of 2005. Online gross profit was $30.4 million or 62 percent of online revenue for the third quarter of 2006.
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA")
Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $51.3 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $14.0 million in the third quarter 2005. InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income to include the effects of the restructuring but exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of our core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and the
investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income in accordance with GAAP accompanies the condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.
Fourth Quarter Outlook
For the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company expects revenue to be between $91 million and $93 million.
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific/ 5 p.m. Eastern. The live Webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate Web site, at A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the call through November 15, 2006, at 7:30 p.m. Pacific/ 10:30 p.m. Eastern.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
On December 5, 2005, the Board of Directors of InfoSpace, Inc. adopted an amendment to the InfoSpace, Inc. 1996 Flexible Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to add the ability to issue restricted stock units ("RSUs") under the Plan, as described in more detail below.
Since its adoption in 1996, the Plan has permitted InfoSpace to make grants of restricted stock. In the case of such an award, the entire number of shares subject to a restricted stock award would be issued at the time of grant. Such shares could be subject to vesting provisions based on time or other conditions specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee of the Board. InfoSpace would have the right to repurchase unvested shares subject to a restricted stock award if the grantee's service to the Company terminated prior to full vesting of the award. Until repurchased, such unvested shares would be considered outstanding for dividend, voting and other purposes.
In contrast to restricted stock awards, the newly-permitted RSUs would represent an obligation of InfoSpace to issue unrestricted shares of common stock to the grantee only when and to the extent that the vesting criteria of the award are satisfied. As in the case of restricted stock awards, vesting criteria for RSUs can be based on time or other conditions specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee of the Board. However, until vesting occurs, the grantee is not entitled to any stockholder rights with respect to the unvested shares.
In addition to approving the amendment to the Plan, the Board approved a form of agreement pursuant to which RSUs could be granted. The Plan as amended and the form of Notice of Grant and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement are attached to this report as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively.
The Board also approved the grant, to be effective December 20, 2006, of up to 1,500,000 RSUs under the Plan to InfoSpace employees, including 285,000 RSUs specifically granted to certain executive officers as described in Item 5.02 of this current report on Form 8-K. The RSUs are to be granted pursuant to the form of Notice of Grant and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement attached to this report as Exhibit 10.2, and, subject to the terms thereof, 50% will vest on December 20, 2007, and 50% will vest on December 20, 2008, subject to continued employment with InfoSpace through the vesting date. Assuming that all of the 1,500,000 RSUs are granted as of December 20, 2006, and assuming a price of $20.10 per share (the closing price of InfoSpace's common stock on December 5, 2006, although the actual charge will be based on the closing price of InfoSpace's common stock on December 20, 2006), a total of approximately $30,150,000 would be expected to be charged to the operating results of InfoSpace over the vesting period. The actual amount of expense will vary subject to a number of factors, including the actual number of RSUs granted, timing of the grant of the RSUs, the closing price of our common stock on such date, and forfeitures or other cancellations.
 
On December 5, 2006, the Board of Directors of InfoSpace, Inc. approved grants, to be effective December 20, 2006, of RSUs under the Plan to certain executive officers as noted in the table below. The RSUs are to be granted pursuant to the form of Notice of Grant and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement attached to this report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, and, subject to the terms thereof, 50% will vest on December 20, 2007, and 50% will vest on December 20, 2008, subject to continued employment with InfoSpace through the vesting date.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 10.2
Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Plan shall have the same defined meanings in this Notice of Grant.
Name: _______________________
You have been granted _________ Restricted Stock Units. Each such Unit is equivalent to one Share of Common Stock of the Company for purposes of determining the number of Shares subject to this award. None of the Restricted Stock Units will be issued (nor will you have the rights of a stockholder with respect to the underlying shares) until the vesting conditions described below are satisfied. Additional terms of this grant are as follows:
 
You acknowledge and agree that this agreement and the vesting schedule set forth herein does not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee, consultant, or directors, as applicable, for the vesting period, for any period, or at all, and shall not interfere with your right or the Company's right to terminate your relationship with the Company at any time, with or without cause.
You hereby agree to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Plan Administrator upon any questions relating to the Plan and this award.
By your signature below, you agree that this Notice of Grant, the form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement attached as Exhibit A hereto and the Restated 1996 Flexible Stock Incentive Plan constitute your entire agreement with respect to this award and may not be modified adversely to your interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and you.
 
1. . The Company hereby grants to the employee listed on the Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock Units (the "Employee") an award of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), as set forth in the Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock Units and subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Company's Restated 1996 Flexible Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Plan shall have the same defined meanings in this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.
Grant
2. . Each RSU represents the right to receive a share of Stock (a "Share") on the vesting date. Unless and until the RSUs vest, the Employee will have no right to receive Shares under such RSUs. Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
Company's Obligation
3. . Subject to paragraph 4, to Plan Section 16 and to any other relevant Plan provisions, the RSUs awarded by this Agreement will vest in the Employee according to the vesting schedule specified in the Notice of Grant.
Vesting Schedule
4. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement or the Notice of Grant, if the Employee terminates service as an employee for any or no reason prior to vesting, the unvested RSUs awarded by this Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company.
Forfeiture upon Termination of Service
5. . Any RSUs that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 will be paid to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee's death, to his or her estate) in Shares, provided that to the extent determined appropriate by the Company, the minimum statutorily required federal, state and local withholding taxes with respect to such RSUs will be paid by reducing the number of vested RSUs actually paid to the Employee.
Payment after Vesting
6. . Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Employee under this Agreement will, if the Employee is then deceased, be made to the administrator or executor of the Employee's estate. Any such administrator or executor must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.
Payments after Death
7. . Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or Employee's broker.
Rights as Stockholder
8. . The Employee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries is on an at-will basis only. Accordingly, the terms of the Employee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries will be determined from time to time by the Company or the Subsidiary employing the Employee (as the case may be), and the Company or the Subsidiary will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause or notice.
No Effect on Employment
9. . Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement will be addressed to the Company at [ADDRESS]; : Stock Administration, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing or electronically.
Address for Notices
Attn
10. . Except to the limited extent provided in paragraph 6, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.
Grant is Not Transferable
11. . Subject to the limitation on the transferability of this grant contained herein, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legatees, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
Binding Agreement
12. . If at any time the Company will determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of Shares to the Employee (or his or her estate), such issuance will not occur unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval will have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.
Additional Conditions to Issuance of Stock
13. . This Agreement and the Notice of Grant are subject to all terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement or the Notice of Grant and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern.
Plan Governs
14. . The Plan Administrator will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any RSUs have vested). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Plan Administrator in good faith will be final and binding upon Employee, the Company and all other interested persons. No member of the Plan Administrator will be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.

Item 5.02
On January 12, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the InfoSpace, Inc. Board of Directors approved the 2007 1H InfoSpace Executive Financial Performance Incentive Plan (the "2007 1H Executive Plan").
The 2007 1H Executive Plan provides for the payment of cash bonuses to eligible senior executives, which include the Chief Executive Officer; Chief Financial Officer; Executive Vice President, Online; and Executive Vice President, Mobile. The payment of these cash bonuses is based upon the attainment of specific revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) objectives established by the Compensation Committee and the achievement by the executive of individual performance objectives reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee for the first half of 2007. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer will have worldwide revenue and EBITDA targets. The Executive Vice Presidents will have business-unit specific revenue and EBITDA targets. These revenue and EBITDA targets have not been included in this description or in the 2007 1H Executive Plan in order to maintain the confidentiality of InfoSpace's confidential commercial or business information.
The above descriptions are subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the 2007 1H Executive Plan which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
On January 12, 2007, the Compensation Committee also approved Amendment No. 1 to Employment Agreement ("Amendment No. 1") amending the employment agreements between InfoSpace, Inc. and each of the following named executive officers: Chief Financial Officer, Allen M. Hsieh, dated November 1, 2006; Executive Vice President Online, Brian T. McManus, dated April 2, 2003; and Executive Vice President Mobile, Steven L. Elfman, dated August 3, 2005 (each, an "Employment Agreement"). The amendment provides for the acceleration of 50% of the employee's then unvested restricted stock units if the employee is terminated by InfoSpace without cause or by the employee for good reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), including in connection with a change of control. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Amendment No. 1 attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and each of the Employment Agreements previously filed.

Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $89.3 million, reflecting a $2.8 million or 3% increase over the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $30.0 million or $0.91 per diluted share versus net income of $37.9 million or $1.13 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005. The fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005 included a tax benefit of $32.6 million and $25.4 million, respectively, primarily from realizing a deferred tax asset related to a portion of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards. Additionally, the Company recorded stock-based compensation costs of $3.3 million and a restructuring charge of $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments as of December 31, 2006 totaled $401.9 million, a net increase of $26.6 million from the end of 2005. At the end of the year, the Company had no debt obligations.
"As we emerge from restructuring, our remaining business continues to generate solid cash flow and our strong balance sheet positions us for growth," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace Inc.
Fourth Quarter and 2006 Segment Information and Adjusted EBITDA
Mobile
Mobile revenues were $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $5.2 million or 12% from the fourth quarter of 2005. Mobile gross profit totaled $18.7 million or 39% of Mobile revenue for the fourth quarter of 2006.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $15.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA was
a negative $27.8 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $70.9 million for the full year 2005. InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income, which includes the effects of the restructuring charges, to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of our core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and the investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income in accordance with GAAP accompanies the condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.
First Quarter Outlook
The Company's guidance excludes the potential impact of any future one-time gains or losses. The Adjusted EBITDA guidance below has been prepared in a manner consistent with the historical Adjusted EBITDA data provided above and in the accompanying table.
For the first quarter of 2007, the Company expects revenue to be between $82 million and $84 million. Additionally, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be between $6.5 million and $7.5 million and GAAP net loss to be between $1.0 million and $1.5 million, or $0.03 and $0.05 per share.

A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the call through February 14, 2007, at 7:30 p.m. Pacific/ 10:30 p.m. Eastern.

On April 26, 2007, InfoSpace, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into an agreement (the "Agreement"), with certain stockholders of the Company that are affiliated with Sandell Asset Management Corp. (collectively, the "Sandell Group"). The Sandell Group had previously filed preliminary proxy materials in connection with the Company's 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2007 Annual Meeting"), which proxy solicitation sought to (a) elect Nick Graziano, Jonathan R. Macey and Paul L. Schaut as Class II directors to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), and (b) repeal any amendments to the Company's restated bylaws that were adopted by the Board after February 12, 2003.
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Sandell Group agreed that it would withdraw and terminate its proxy solicitation in connection with the 2007 Annual Meeting. In addition, the Sandell Group agreed that it would cause all shares of the Company's common stock beneficially owned by it and its controlled affiliates to be present and voted in favor of the Company's Nominees (as defined below) at the 2007 Annual Meeting, and that such shares would be voted against the approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with, any proposal or nominees recommended by the Board at the 2007 Annual Meeting.
The Agreement also provides that the Board would appoint Nick Graziano, an individual affiliated with the Sandell Group, to the Board as a Class II director not later than May 3, 2007. In addition, the Company agreed to promptly amend its proxy statement on Schedule 14A to indicate that (i) Richard D. Hearney, James F. Voelker and Nick Graziano are being nominated by the Board as the sole nominees (the "Nominees") of the Company for election as Class II directors at the 2007 Annual Meeting, (ii) William J. Ruckelshaus is not standing for election to the Board at the 2007 Annual Meeting, (iii) the Board recommends that the Company's stockholders vote "for" the Nominees at the 2007 Annual Meeting, and that the Board is soliciting its stockholders to vote for the Nominees, (iv) proxies solicited by the Board would be voted "for" the Nominees at the Annual Meeting, (v) the Board would form, and Nick Graziano would be appointed as a member of, a new committee of the Board created for the purpose of evaluating and making recommendations concerning the Company's business and strategy, (vi) William J. Ruckelshaus would be appointed to the Board to fill a Class I vacancy immediately following the 2007 Annual Meeting.
Furthermore, the Company also agreed to pay a special dividend to the Company's stockholders aggregating at least $200 million as promptly as practicable, and to reauthorize the Company's previously authorized $100 million stock repurchase program.

EXECUTION COPY

Election of Directors
On May 2, 2007, the Board of Directors ("") of InfoSpace, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), elected William J. Ruckelshaus and Nicholas (Nick) F. Graziano to the Board to fill two existing vacancies.
Board
Company
Mr. Graziano was selected as a director pursuant to an agreement between the Company and certain Company stockholders affiliated with Sandell Asset Management Corp. (the ""). Pursuant to the Sandell Agreement, the Board agreed to (i) elect Mr. Graziano to the Board as a Class II director to fill an existing vacancy, and (ii) replace Mr. Ruckelshaus with Mr. Graziano as a nominee for election to the Board as a Class II director at the Company's 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Sandell Agreement also contemplates that the Board will elect Mr. Ruckelshaus to the Board as a Class I director to fill an existing vacancy.
Sandell Agreement
Pursuant to the terms of the Sandell Agreement, Mr. Graziano also will be appointed as a member of a committee of the Board to be created for the purpose of evaluating and making recommendations concerning the Company's business and strategy, when such committee is formed.
The complete text of the Sandell Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 2, 2007 and is incorporated herein by reference.
(e)
Reference is made to the disclosure under the heading "Compensatory Arrangements" provided in Item 8.01 below.
 
Declaration of Dividend
On May 2, 2007, the Board declared a special one-time cash distribution by means of a dividend on the Company's common stock of $6.30 per share (the ""). The Distribution will be payable on or about May 28, 2007 with respect to all shares of the Company's common stock outstanding at the close of business on May 18, 2007 (the "").
Distribution
Record Date
The Company believes that a significant portion of the Distribution may be deemed a tax-free return of capital to most stockholders to the extent of each stockholder's tax basis in his, her or its shares.
Tax Consequences
A portion of the Distribution may be taxable as "qualified dividend income" to the extent paid out of a stockholder's pro rata share of the Company's current or accumulated earnings and profits. The portion of the Distribution that will be taxable as qualified dividend income will not be determined until after December 31, 2007, because such portion is dependent on the earnings and profits of the Company
 
for its taxable year ending December 31, 2007, which the Company will not be able to definitively calculate until after the end of the taxable year. The final determination of the portion of the Distribution, if any, that will be treated as qualified dividend income will be reported to recipients of the Distribution on a tax information return in early 2008.
Any portion of the Distribution in excess of each holder's pro rata share of the Company's earnings and profits will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of each stockholder's tax basis in his, her or its shares of the Company's common stock, with any remaining portion treated as capital gain.
Non-United States holders of the Company's common stock generally will be subject to withholding on the gross amount of the Distribution at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be permitted by an applicable income tax treaty.
Because individual tax circumstances of stockholders vary, stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the Distribution.
Compensation Program
The Company's employees and members of its Board who hold stock options and restricted stock units will not receive the Distribution with respect to such equity awards because the Distribution will only be paid to holders of the Company's common stock as of the Record Date. The Company believes that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that employees and members of the Board who hold outstanding in-the-money stock option awards and restricted stock units (collectively "") be compensated with respect to the Distribution. As such, in connection with the Distribution, the Board, in consultation with a compensation consulting firm, approved a program (the "") designed to compensate employees and members of the Board who hold Equity Awards in respect of the potential decrease in the value of their Equity Awards attributable to the Distribution.

Pursuant to the Compensation Program, holders of vested in-the-money stock options will receive cash payments equal to the reduction in value of the Company common stock underlying such stock options that is attributable to the Distribution, based on the share price of the Company's common stock before and after the Distribution (as measured by the difference between the 30-day average closing price of the Company's common stock before, and the 5-day average closing price of the Company's common stock on and after, the ex-dividend date), and each payment will include a "gross-up" amount intended to offset the assumed tax effect of the payment to the recipient.
Also pursuant to the Compensation Program, holders of unvested in-the-money stock options and restricted stock units will receive grants of restricted stock units with a value equal to the reduction in value of such holders' unvested in-the-money stock options and restricted stock units, based on the share price of the Company's common stock before and after the Distribution (as measured by the difference between the 30-day average closing price of the Company's common stock before, and the 5-day average closing price of the Company's common stock on and after, the ex-dividend date). The vesting schedule of such grants shall be the same as the existing Equity Awards with respect to which they are issued.
Based upon (i) an assumed number of Equity Awards held by employees and members of the Board as of May 18, 2007, (ii) an assumed 30-day average closing price of the Company's common stock before the ex-dividend date of $25.17 (the closing price of the Company's common stock on May 2, 2007, with such assumed amount used to determine both the reduction of value of shares of Company common stock attributable to the Distribution and whether an individual stock option is in-the-money),
 
and (iii) an assumed 5-day average closing price of the Company's common stock on and after the ex-dividend date of $18.87 (the closing price of the Company's common stock on May 2, 2007 less the amount of the Distribution, with such assumed amount used to determine the reduction of value of shares of Company common stock attributable to the Distribution) (the ""), the combined cash payments and non-cash compensation expenses associated with the Compensation Program would equal approximately $31 million. However, the actual remuneration payable to holders of Equity Awards pursuant to the Compensation Program will depend on the average closing price of the Company's common stock before, on and after the ex-dividend date, as described above.
Assumptions
The Company previously provided estimates with respect to its financial performance for the three-month period ending June 30, 2007, and fiscal year ending December 31, 2007, specifying that such estimates excluded the impact of the Distribution. Those estimates also exclude the impact of the Compensation Program. The Company anticipates that the cash payments under the Compensation Program will be accounted for as operating expenses during the three-month period ending June 30, 2007, and the restricted stock units granted under the Compensation Program will be accounted for as operating expenses over the vesting periods of such awards.
Compensatory Arrangements
All employees of the Company that hold Equity Awards are eligible to participate in the Compensation Program, including the Company's current executive officers. In addition, members of the Board are also eligible to participate in the Compensation Program.
Estimated remuneration to the Company's current executive officers who are receiving benefits pursuant to the Compensation Program is set forth in the table below, calculated based on the Assumptions. The actual remuneration payable to the executive officers and to all holders of Company Equity Awards will depend on the average closing price of the Company's common stock before, on and after the ex-dividend date, as described above.

99.1    Press Release, dated August 8, 2007
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: August 8, 2007
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash. (August 8, 2007)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2007.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2007 were $70.5 million, reflecting a $25.3 million decrease over the second quarter of 2006. Of this decrease, $19.0 million was attributable to the exit of the mobile media business.
Net loss for the second quarter of 2007 was $28.1 million, or $0.86 per share, versus net income of $1.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006. Net loss in the second quarter of 2007 includes a $22.3 million payment, or $0.68 per share, made to employees and directors related to the $208.2 million special dividend to shareholders. Additionally, the Company recorded an $8.8 million non-cash charge, or $0.27 per share, for stock-based compensation expense.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments as of June 30, 2007 totaled $197.8 million, after accounting for the cash distribution to shareholders of $208.2 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, the Company had no debt obligations.
"Our second quarter operating results were largely in line with expectations. We have completed our restructuring, exited the mobile media business and significantly reduced costs. Moreover, we have good momentum in the mobile services business and have added several new high quality online distribution partners," said Jim Voelker, Chairman and CEO of InfoSpace, Inc. "Additionally, we completed the $208 million special dividend and reauthorized our $100 million stock repurchase plan."
Second Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
InfoSpace:
 
 
 
 
 
Second Quarter 2007 Segment Information and Adjusted EBITDA
Online
Online revenues were $39.7 million in the second quarter of 2007, a decrease of $10.6 million, compared to the second quarter of 2006. The revenue decrease is largely attributable to the reduction in traffic from the Company's search engine marketing distribution partners. Online segment income was $15.8 million in the second quarter of 2007.
Mobile
Mobile revenues were $30.8 million in the second quarter of 2007, a net decrease of $14.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2006. The $30.8 million is comprised of $13.4 million in mobile services revenues, an increase of $4.3 million from the second quarter of 2006 and $17.4 million in media content revenues, representing a decrease of $19.0 million from the second quarter of 2006. Mobile segment loss was $3.6 million in the second quarter of 2007.
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA")
Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $17.5 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income, which includes the effects of the restructuring charges, the payments made to employees and directors related to the cash distribution to shareholders, and sale of non-core operations, to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of the Company's core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and its investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income in accordance with GAAP accompanies the condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.
Third Quarter and Full Year Outlook
The Company's guidance excludes the potential impact of any future one-time gains or losses. The Adjusted EBITDA guidance below has been prepared in a manner consistent with the historical Adjusted EBITDA data provided above and in the accompanying table.
For the third quarter of 2007, with the exit of the mobile media business ($17.4 million in the second quarter of 2007), the Company expects revenue to be between $49 million and $51 million. Additionally, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be between $1 million and $2 million and GAAP net loss to be between $16.5 million and $17.5 million, or $0.50 and $0.53 per share.
For the full year of 2007, the Company expects revenue to be between $260 million and $264 million (includes $47.1 million from the mobile media business that the Company exited in the second quarter of 2007). Additionally, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $1 million and $3 million (includes a $22.3 million payment made to employees and directors related to the $208.2 million special dividend to shareholders) and GAAP net loss to be between $55 million and $57 million (includes $43 million of stock-based compensation), or $1.68 and $1.74 per share.

A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the call through August 20, 2007, at 7:30 p.m. Pacific/ 10:30 p.m. Eastern.

Exhibit 99.1
InfoSpace to Sell Online Directory
Business for $225 Million in Cash
Transaction Unlocks Value of Directory Business, Capitalizes on NOL and Reinforces Company's Focus on Shareholder Value Creation
BELLEVUE, Wash., Sep 17, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) 
InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSP) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a definitive agreement under which InfoSpace will sell its online directory business, including the Company's online yellow and white pages services, to Idearc Inc. (NYSE:IAR), for $225 million in cash.
"The sale of our directory business is part of the Board of Directors' ongoing review of our company and the opportunities available to enhance value for our shareholders," said Jim Voelker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of InfoSpace. "In addition to unlocking the value of our directory business that was not reflected in the Company's market valuation, this transaction is extremely tax efficient, allowing us to capitalize on our net operating losses to significantly maximize the cash proceeds from the sale."
The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2007 upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
Upon completion of the transaction, the Company expects to return the net proceeds from the sale to shareholders as a special cash distribution. The Company will utilize a portion of its net-operating loss carry-forwards to offset substantially all of the taxable gain resulting from the sale, increasing the cash available for distribution to shareholders. At closing, InfoSpace's cash position is expected to be in excess of $400 million.
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is acting as financial advisor and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati is acting as legal counsel to InfoSpace in connection with the transactions.

BELLEVUE, Washington, October 15, 2007  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSP) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its mobile services business to Motricity, a privately held provider of mobile content services and solutions, for $135 million in cash.
"This transaction is another opportunity to unlock value for our shareholders," said Jim Voelker, Chairman and CEO of InfoSpace. "Like the previously announced sale of our online directory business for $225 million in cash, this transaction is extremely tax efficient, allowing us to capitalize on our net operating losses to significantly maximize the cash proceeds from the sale.
Prior to anticipated cash distributions, after completion of the sale of the online directory business and upon completion of the sale of the mobile business, the Company expects to have in excess of $550 million in cash.
"With these transactions, InfoSpace will be solely focused on online search. We will maintain a strong financial position and a solid distribution network with over 100 private label partners as well as our award winning branded websites such as Dogpile.com. Based on results for the first half of the year, our search business represents over 60% of InfoSpace's revenue. Our search business is highly scalable and continues to generate strong cash flow," concluded Mr. Voelker.
Following the close of the transaction, the Company expects to return a significant portion of the net proceeds from the sale to shareholders as a special cash distribution. The Company will utilize a portion of its net-operating loss carry-forwards to offset substantially all of the taxable gain resulting from the sale, increasing the cash available for distribution to shareholders.
The transaction is expected to be completed within the next 90 days, upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is acting as financial advisor and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati is acting as legal counsel to InfoSpace in connection with the transaction.

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash. (November 1, 2007)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2007.
"We are pleased with our third quarter operating results, as we exceeded our expectations in both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA," said Jim Voelker, Chairman and CEO of InfoSpace, Inc. "Additionally, we unlocked significant value for InfoSpace shareholders through the sale of our directory business for $225 million and the pending sale of our mobile business for $135 million. We expect to return the majority of the net proceeds from the sales to shareholders. Going forward, InfoSpace will be a leading metasearch company with a strong financial position, solid cash flows, a large distribution network and award-winning branded websites. We are honing our strategic priorities for the upcoming year to ensure we fully capitalize on these strengths and continue to drive value creation."
Revenues for the third quarter of 2007 were $48.7 million and include both online search revenues and mobile revenues; however, they exclude online directory revenues of $8.7 million which are now treated as discontinued operations for the third quarter of 2007 and all prior periods. If the directory business had remained part of continuing operations of InfoSpace, revenues would have been $57.5 million for the third quarter of 2007.
Net loss for the third quarter of 2007, which includes the directory business as discontinued operations, was $12.3 million, or $0.37 per share.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments as of September 30, 2007 totaled $214.8 million. At the end of the quarter, the Company had no debt obligations.
Third Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments

Other
Additionally, in connection with the announced transactions, Brian McManus, Executive Vice President of the Online division, will leave the Company by the end of the year.
"Brian has made significant contributions to InfoSpace during his tenure," said Voelker. "We appreciate his dedicated service to this organization and wish him the best in his future endeavors."
Third Quarter 2007 Segment Information and Adjusted EBITDA
Online Search
Online search revenues were $33.9 million in the third quarter of 2007, a decrease of $6.8 million, compared to the third quarter of 2006. Online search segment income was $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2007. Directory revenues of $8.7 million as well as the related operating expenses are excluded from the segment results and included as a component of discontinued operations.
Mobile
Mobile revenues were $14.9 million in the third quarter of 2007, a decrease of $32.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2006. Mobile revenues included $13.9 million of mobile services revenues in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2006 and the remainder is attributable to the mobile media business. Mobile segment loss was $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2007.
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") from Continuing Operations
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared to negative Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $56.2 million in the third quarter of 2006. InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is calculated by adjusting GAAP loss from continuing operations, which includes the effects of the restructuring charges, the payments made to employees and directors related to the cash distribution to shareholders, and sale of non-core operations, and to exclude discontinued operations, the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of the Company's core business operating results. InfoSpace
believes that management and its investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to the loss from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP accompanies the condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.
Fourth Quarter Outlook
Starting in the fourth quarter of 2007, in addition to the directory business, the Company will present its mobile business as a discontinued operation and will also adjust all prior periods. Accordingly, fourth quarter guidance for revenue, Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and income from continuing operations represents only the Online search business. The Company will not be providing guidance for the revenue and operating expense components of the directory or mobile businesses. In addition, the Company's guidance excludes the potential impact of any future one-time gains or losses, including the gain from the sale of the directory business and the expected gain from the pending sale of the mobile businesses. The Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations guidance below has been prepared in a manner consistent with the historical Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations provided above and in the accompanying table.
For the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company expects revenue for its online search business to be between $34 million and $35 million. Additionally, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to be approximately $1 million and GAAP loss from continuing operations, to be between $7.5 million and $8.5 million, or $0.22 and $0.25 per share.
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific/ 5 p.m. Eastern. The live Webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate Web site, at . A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the call through November 10, 2007, at 7:30 p.m. Pacific/ 10:30 p.m. Eastern.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 restructuring and other, net consists of a gain on the sale of the assets related to the mobile media operations of $0 and $3.3 million, respectively, and adjustments to estimated restructuring charges of $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 restructuring and other, net consists of a restructuring charge of $57.8 million, comprised of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment of $44.5 million, employee separation costs of $6.3 million, a benefit of $1.1 million related to stock compensation, losses on contractual commitments of $5.6 million, and costs of $2.4 million for abandoned facilities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1)
Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") from continuing operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled to loss from continuing operations, which the Company's management believes to be the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") measure. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations results are calculated by adjusting GAAP loss from continuing operations to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and other income, net (including such items as interest income, litigation settlements and contingencies, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed above. This calculation excludes the directory business, as it has been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons. The Company's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance. This non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.

As presented in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(3)
Other income, net, primarily consists of interest income, gains or losses from the disposal of assets, and foreign currency transaction gains or losses.
(4)
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations reconciliation for forward looking guidance excludes both the directory and mobile businesses, as each will be classified as discontinued operations in future periods.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
Amendment to Bylaws
On November 14, 2007, the Board of Directors ("") of InfoSpace, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), amended the Restated Bylaws of InfoSpace, Inc. (""), as follows:
Board
Company
Bylaws
Section 6.2 of the Bylaws was amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the Corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Every holder of stock of the Corporation represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman or vice-chairperson of the Board of Directors, or the President or vice-president and by the Secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be by a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. The Corporation shall not have power to issue a certificate in bearer form.
Section 6.2. Stock Certificates.
Section 6.5 of the Bylaws was amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the manner prescribed by law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the record holder of such stock or by his or her attorney lawfully constituted in writing and, if such stock is certificated, upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, which shall be canceled before a new certificate shall be issued.
Section 6.5. Transfers.
Section 6.4 of the Bylaws was deleted in its entirety.
The amendments to Sections 6.2 and 6.5 of the Bylaws were adopted to enable the Company to comply with Marketplace Rule 4350(l) of the NASDAQ Manual, which requires that, beginning on January 1, 2008, all securities listed on Nasdaq be eligible for a "Direct Registration Program" operated by a clearing agency registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The deletion of Section 6.4 of the Bylaws was adopted to remove the requirement that a restrictive legend be included on all stock certificates representing shares of the Company, subject to certain exceptions.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, as amended, attached as Exhibit 3.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Declaration of Dividend
On November 14, 2007, the Board declared a special cash distribution by means of a dividend on the Company's common stock, in an amount of $9.00 per share (the ""). The Distribution will be payable on or about January 8, 2008 with respect to all shares of the Company's common stock outstanding at the close of business on December 10, 2007 (the "").
Distribution
Record Date
Tax Consequences
A portion of the Distribution may be taxable as "qualified dividend income" to the extent paid out of a stockholder's pro rata share of the Company's current or accumulated earnings and profits. The portion of the Distribution that will be taxable as qualified dividend income will not be determined until after December 31, 2008, because such portion is dependent on the earnings and profits of the Company for its taxable year ending December 31, 2008, which the Company will not be able to definitively calculate until after the end of the taxable year. The final determination of the portion of the Distribution, if any, that will be treated as qualified dividend income will be reported to recipients of the Distribution on a tax information return in early 2009.
Any portion of the Distribution in excess of each holder's pro rata share of the Company's earnings and profits will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of each stockholder's tax basis in his, her or its shares of the Company's common stock, with any remaining portion treated as capital gain.
Non-United States holders of the Company's common stock generally will be subject to withholding on the gross amount of the Distribution at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be permitted by an applicable income tax treaty.
Because individual tax circumstances of stockholders vary, stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the Distribution.
Compensation Program
The Company's employees and members of its Board who hold outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock units will not receive the Distribution with respect to such equity awards because the Distribution will only be paid to holders of the Company's common stock as of the Record Date. The Company believes that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that employees and members of the Board who hold outstanding in-the-money stock option awards and unvested restricted stock units (collectively "") be compensated with respect to the Distribution. As such, in connection with the Distribution, the Board approved a program (the "") designed to compensate employees (other than certain officers of the Company with employment contracts with the Company) and members of the Board who hold Equity Awards in respect of the potential decrease in the value of their Equity Awards attributable to the Distribution. "In-the-money" options are those options with an exercise per share lower than the 30-day average closing price of the Company's common stock before the ex-dividend date.
Equity Awards
Compensation Program
Pursuant to the Compensation Program, holders of outstanding vested in-the-money stock options as of the ex-dividend date, outstanding unvested in-the-money stock options on the ex-dividend date that would have vested on or prior to December 31, 2007, or outstanding restricted stock units on the ex-dividend date that would have vested on or prior to December 31, 2007, will receive cash payments equal to the reduction in value of the Company common stock underlying such stock options or restricted stock units that is attributable to the Distribution, up to $9.00 per share underlying such stock options or restricted stock units, based on the share price of the Company's common stock before and after the Distribution (as measured by the difference between the 30-day average closing price of the Company's
 
common stock before, and the 5-day average closing price of the Company's common stock beginning on the ex-dividend date), plus an estimated amount which, after payment of all Federal, state and local income, excise and employment taxes imposed thereon, will be approximately equal to the amount by which (x) the aggregate amount of all Federal, state and local income, excise taxes and employment taxes payable by the employee or Board member on the cash payment exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of all Federal, state and local income, excise and employment taxes that would have been payable by the employee or Board member on the amount of the cash payment if the employee or Board member had received such amount from the Company as a corporate dividend instead of as a payment of compensation.
Also pursuant to the Compensation Program, holders of outstanding in-the-money stock options as of the ex-dividend date that would not have vested on or prior to December 31, 2007, as well as holders of outstanding restricted stock units as of the ex-dividend date that would not have vested on or prior to December 31, 2007, will receive grants of restricted stock units with a value equal to the reduction in value of such holders' unvested in-the-money stock options and restricted stock units, up to $9.00 per share underlying such stock options or restricted stock units, based on the share price of the Company's common stock before and after the Distribution (as measured by the difference between the 30-day average closing price of the Company's common stock before, and the 5-day average closing price of the Company's common stock beginning on the ex-dividend date). The vesting schedule of such grants shall be the same as the existing Equity Awards with respect to which they are issued.
Based upon (i) an assumed number of Equity Awards held by employees and members of the Board as of November 14, 2007, (ii) an assumed 30-day average closing price of the Company's common stock before the ex-dividend date of $18.00 per share (this assumed amount is also used to determine whether an individual stock option is in-the-money), (iii) an assumed 5-day average closing price of the Company's common stock beginning on the ex-dividend date of $9.00 per share (the assumed $18.00 per share price above less the amount of the Distribution), and (iv) the terms of the employment agreements with certain officers of the Company (the ""), the cash payments associated with the Compensation Program and payment to certain officers of the Company under their employment agreements would equal approximately $35.9 million, and the non-cash payments, excluding such non-cash payments to the Company's mobile business employees (assuming the closing of the recently announced signing of a definitive agreement with Motricity, Inc. for the sale of the Company's mobile business to Motricity, Inc.) would equal approximately $6.5 million. However, the actual remuneration payable to holders of Equity Awards pursuant to the Compensation Program and employment agreements will depend on the average closing price of the Company's common stock before, on and after the ex-dividend date, as described above, and the number of outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock units as of January 1, 2008.
Assumptions
Compensatory Arrangements
The Company's current executive officers will not participate in the Compensation Program but will receive cash payments in connection with the Distribution as set forth in their employment agreements with the Company, which employment agreements were previously filed by the Company as exhibits to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 9, 2007.
Estimated remuneration to the Company's current executive officers under their employment agreements is set forth in the table below, calculated based on the Assumptions and the terms of their respective employment agreements.
 
The Company previously provided estimates with respect to its financial performance for the three-month period ending December 31, 2007. Those estimates excluded the impact of non-recurring charges, including the charges associated with the Distribution, the Compensation Program and the payments due to certain officers of the Company under their employment agreements as a result of the Distribution discussed above. The Company anticipates that the cash payments under the Compensation Program and the payments due to certain officers under their employment contracts as a result of the Distribution will be accounted for as operating expenses during the three-month period ending December 31, 2007, and the restricted stock units granted under the Compensation Program will be accounted for as operating expenses over the vesting periods of such awards.

At any time prior to the commencement of the annual meeting, the Board may postpone the annual meeting.
 
The Chairman of the Board, the President, the Board or the holders of not less than 30 percent of all the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote on any issue proposed to be considered at the meeting may call special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose.
 
All meetings shall be held at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place within or without the State of Delaware designated by the Board, by any persons entitled to call a meeting hereunder or in a waiver of notice signed by all of the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.
 
The Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary or the Board shall cause to be delivered to each stockholder entitled to notice of or to vote at the meeting either personally or by mail, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the meeting, written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called; except that where the matter to be acted on is a merger or consolidation of the corporation or the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the corporation's assets other than in the ordinary course of business, such notice shall be given not less than 20 nor more than 60 days prior to such meeting. Upon written request by the holders of not less than the number of outstanding shares of the corporation specified in subsection 2.2 hereof and entitled to vote at the meeting, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to give notice of a special meeting of stockholders to be held on such date and at such place and hour as the Secretary may fix, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days after receipt of said request, and if the Secretary shall neglect or refuse to issue such notice, the person making the request may do so and may fix the date for such meeting. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed delivered when deposited in the official government mail properly addressed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation with postage prepaid. If the notice is telegraphed, it shall be deemed delivered when the content of the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company. Notice given in any other manner shall be deemed delivered when dispatched to the stockholder's address, telephone number or other number appearing on the stock transfer records of the corporation.
 
 
Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose (a) by or at the direction of the Board or (b) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section, who shall be entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not fewer than 60 nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting; , , that in the event that less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was first given or such public disclosure was first made. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A
provided
however
 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including, without limitation, such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; and (b) as to the stockholder giving notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's stock ledger, of such stockholder, (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such stockholder and (iii) if the stockholder intends, directly or indirectly, to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder's nominees, a representation to that effect. In addition, if the stockholder intends, directly or indirectly, to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee(s) for election or reelection as a director, the stockholder's notice shall set forth, as to the stockholder and any other participants in the solicitation of proxies, all information relating thereto that is required pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act. At the request of the Board, any person nominated by the Board for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election at any meeting of stockholders as a director of the corporation unless nominated in compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5.1. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in compliance with the procedures prescribed by the Bylaws, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nominations shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.5.1.
The procedures set forth in this subsection 2.5.1 for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the requirements set forth in Rule 14a-8 under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor provision.
 
At the annual meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, any business other than the nomination of persons for election to the Board (which is governed by subsection 2.5.1 of the Bylaws) must be a proper subject for stockholder action under the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same may be amended (the "DGCL"), and must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section and who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not fewer than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting; , , that in the event that less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the
provided
however
 
meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was first mailed or such public disclosure was first made. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary of the corporation shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, (b) as to the stockholder giving such notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's stock ledger, of such stockholder, (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such stockholder, and (iii) if the stockholder intends, directly or indirectly, to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal, a representation to that effect; and (c) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5.2 (or with respect to the nomination of persons for election to the Board, Section 2.5.1 of the Bylaws). In addition, if the stockholder intends, directly or indirectly, to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal, the stockholder's notice shall set forth, as to the stockholder and any other participants in the solicitation of proxies, all information relating thereto that is required pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.5.2, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
At any special meeting of the stockholders, only such business as is specified in the notice of such special meeting given by or at the direction of the person or persons calling such meeting pursuant to subsections 2.2 and 2.4 of the Bylaws shall come before such meeting.
 
Any written notice required to be delivered by a stockholder to the corporation pursuant to subsection 2.5.1 or subsection 2.5.2 hereof must be given, either by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary at the corporation's executive offices.
 
 
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any stockholder under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.
 
The attendance of a stockholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
 
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall not be more than 60 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the corporation, request the Board to fix a record date. The Board shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
 
corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Section 2.7.2, to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance with Section 2.7.2 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this Section 2.7.3 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
 
At least 10 days before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, shall be made, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and number of shares held by each stockholder. This list shall be open to examination by any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. This list shall also be produced and kept at such meeting for inspection by any stockholder who is present.
 
A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of the stockholders; provided, that where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. If a quorum is present or represented at a reconvened meeting following such an adjournment, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
 
In all matters other than the election of Directors, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, if a quorum of such class or classes is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of outstanding shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors.
 
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. Such authorization may be accomplished by (a) the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent executing a writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including facsimile signature or (b) by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the intended holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service or similar agent duly authorized by the intended proxy holder to receive such transmission; provided, that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission must either set forth or be accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
 
reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission by which a stockholder has authorized another person to act as proxy for such stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
A proxy shall be filed with the Secretary before or at the time of the meeting or the delivery to the corporation of the consent to corporate action in writing. A proxy shall become invalid three years after the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A proxy with respect to a specified meeting shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any reconvened meeting following adjournment of such meeting but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof.
 
Each outstanding share entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter of an issue submitted to a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote upon each such issue.
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at an election of Directors may vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by such stockholder for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected and for whose election such stockholder has a right to vote; provided, however, that no cumulative voting shall be permitted in the election of Directors.
 
Subject to subsections 2.7.2 and 2.7.3 hereof and the following paragraph, any action that is properly brought before the stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors and that could be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall (a) be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to be voted with respect to the subject matter thereof having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted (as determined in accordance with subsection 2.6.2 hereof) and (b) be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the records of proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the
 
corporate action referred to therein unless written consents signed by the requisite number of stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof are delivered to the corporation, in the manner required by this Section 2, within 60 (or the maximum number permitted by applicable law) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation in the manner required by this Section 2. The validity of any consent executed by a proxy for a stockholder pursuant to a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission transmitted to such proxy holder by or upon the authorization of the stockholder shall be determined by or at the direction of the Secretary. A written record of the information upon which the person making such determination relied shall be made and kept in the records of the proceedings of the stockholders. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Any such consent shall be inserted in the minute book as if it were the minutes of a meeting of the stockholders.
 
 
In advance of any meeting of stockholders after this corporation has become a Public Company (as defined below), the Board shall appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of election at such meeting and to make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons to serve as alternate inspectors to serve in place of any inspector who is unable or fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of such meeting shall appoint one or more persons to act as inspector of elections at such meeting. This corporation shall be a "Public Company" upon the earliest of (a) a vote by the Board of Directors of the corporation designating the corporation a Public Company, (b) when a registration statement filed by the corporation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with an offering of the corporation's securities to the public first becomes effective or (c) upon the effective date of the registration of the corporation's securities pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
The inspectors of election shall:
(a) ascertain the number of shares of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share;
(b) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots;
(c) count all votes and ballots;
 
(d) determine and retain for a reasonable period of time a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by them; and
(e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of the votes and ballots.
The validity of any proxy or ballot shall be determined by the inspectors of election in accordance with the applicable provisions of these Bylaws and the DGCL as then in effect. In determining the validity of any proxy transmitted by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission, the inspectors shall record in writing the information upon which they relied in making such determination. Each inspector of elections shall, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors of election may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist them in the performance of their duties.
SECTION 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 
The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by the Board.
 
The number and tenure of the Directors shall be governed by Article 5 of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
 
At each election of Directors, the persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be the Directors.
 
An annual Board meeting shall be held without notice immediately after and at the same place as the annual meeting of stockholders. By resolution, the Board or any committee designated by the Board may specify the time and place either within or without the State of Delaware for holding regular meetings thereof without other notice than such resolution.
 
Special meetings of the Board or any committee appointed by the Board may be called by or at the request of the Board, Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or, in the case of any special Board meetings, any three (3) directors, and, in the case of any special meeting of any committee appointed by the Board, by such committee or the Chairman thereof. The person or persons authorized to
 
call special meetings may fix any place either within or without the State of Delaware as the place for holding any special meeting called by them.
 
Members of the Board or any committee designated by the Board may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting.
 
Notice of a special Board or committee meeting stating the place, day and hour of the meeting shall be given to a Director in writing or orally by telephone or in person. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting need be specified in the notice of such meeting.
 
If notice is given by personal delivery, the notice shall be effective if delivered to a Director at least two days before the meeting.
 
If notice is delivered by mail, the notice shall be deemed effective if deposited in the official government mail properly addressed to a Director at his or her address shown on the records of the corporation with postage prepaid at least five days before the meeting.

If notice is delivered orally, by telephone or in person, the notice shall be deemed effective if personally given to the Director at least two days before the meeting.
 
 
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any Director under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board or any committee appointed by the Board need be specified in the waiver of notice of such meeting.
 
The attendance of a Director at a Board or committee meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
A majority of the total number of Directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws or, if vacancies exist on the Board, a majority of the total number of Directors then serving on the Board, provided, however, that such number may be not less than one-third of the total number of Directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any Board meeting. If less than a majority are present at a meeting, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.
 
The act of the majority of the Directors present at a Board or committee meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board or committee, unless the vote of a greater number is required by these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL.
 
A Director of the corporation present at a Board or committee meeting at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting, or unless such Director files a written dissent to such action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof, or forwards such dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. A Director who voted in favor of such action may not dissent.
 
Any action that could be taken at a meeting of the Board or of any committee appointed by the Board may be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth the action so taken is signed by each of the Directors or by each committee member. Any such written consent shall be inserted in the minute book as if it were the minutes of a Board or a committee meeting.
 
Any Director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board, or to the registered office of the corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if the time is not specified, upon delivery thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
One or more members of the Board (including the entire Board) may be removed, but only for cause, at a meeting of stockholders called expressly for that purpose, or without a meeting pursuant to Section 2.14 of these Bylaws, by the holders of not less than a majority of the shares entitled to elect the Director or Directors whose removal is sought in the manner provided by these Bylaws.
 
Any vacancy occurring on the Board may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors, whether or not they constitute a quorum of the Board. A Director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office, if any. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of Directors may be filled by the Board for a term of office continuing only until the next election of Directors, and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualify.
 
 
The Board may, by resolution passed by a majority of the number of Directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws, appoint standing or temporary committees, each committee to consist of one or more Directors of the corporation. The Board may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board establishing such committee or as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that require it to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
In addition to any committees appointed pursuant to this subsection 3.16, no later than such time as this corporation may become a Public Company there shall be an Audit Committee, appointed annually by the Board, consisting of at least two Directors who are not members of management. It shall be the responsibility of the Audit Committee, if and when appointed, to review the scope and results of the annual independent audit of books and records of the corporation, to review compliance with all corporate policies which have been approved by the Board and to discharge such other responsibilities as may from time to time be assigned to it by the Board. The Audit Committee shall meet at such times and places as the members deem advisable, and shall make such recommendations to the Board as they consider appropriate.
 
The Board may, in its discretion, designate a Compensation Committee consisting of one or more Directors as it may from time to time determine.

The duties of the Nominating and Organization Committee shall consist of the following: (a) to report and make recommendations to the Board on the size and composition of the Board and nominees for Directors; (b) to evaluate the performance of the officers of the corporation and together with management, select and recommend to the Board appropriate individuals for election, appointment and promotion as officers of the corporation and ensure the continuity of capable management; (c) to report and make recommendations to the Board on the organization of the corporation; and (d) to perform such other duties as shall be assigned to the Nominating and Organization Committee by the Board.
 
All committees so appointed shall keep regular minutes of their meetings and shall cause them to be recorded in books kept for that purpose.
 
A majority of the number of Directors composing any committee of the Board, as established and fixed by resolution of the Board, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of such committee but, if less than a majority are present at a meeting, a majority of such Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. The act of a majority of the members of a committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of such committee.
 
Any member of any committee may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary, the Board or the Chairman of such committee. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time is not specified, upon delivery thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
The Board may remove from office any member of any committee elected or appointed by it, but only by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the number of Directors fixed by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws.
 
By Board resolution, Directors and committee members may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each Board or committee meeting, a fixed sum for
 
attendance at each Board or committee meeting, or a stated salary as Director or a committee member, or a combination of the foregoing. No such payment shall preclude any Director or committee member from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
SECTION 4. OFFICERS

SECTION 9. SEAL
The seal of the corporation, if any, shall consist of the name of the corporation, the state of its incorporation and the year of its incorporation.
SECTION 10. INDEMNIFICATION
 
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the corporation or that, being or having been such a Director or officer of the corporation, he or she is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such a Director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as such a Director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the full extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in subsection 10.2 hereof with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this subsection 10.1 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this subsection 10.1 or otherwise.
 
If a claim under subsection 10.1 hereof is not paid in full by the corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Section 10 upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for an advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.
 
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Section 10 shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors, provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation or otherwise. Notwithstanding any amendment to or repeal of this Section 10, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
 
The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. The corporation, without further stockholder approval, may enter into contracts with any Director, officer, employee or agent in furtherance of the provisions of this Section 10 and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Section 10.
 
The corporation may, by action of the Board, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees or agents or groups of employees or agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Section 10 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Directors and officers of the corporation; provided, however, that an undertaking shall be made by an employee or agent only if required by the Board.
 
Any person who is or was a Director or officer of the corporation who is or was serving (a) as a Director or officer of another corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its Directors is held by the corporation or (b) in an executive or management capacity in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation is a general partner or has a majority ownership shall be deemed to be so serving at the request of the corporation and entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under subsection 10.1 hereof.
 
The Board may establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 10, determination of the entitlement of any person thereto and review of any such determination. Such procedures shall be set forth in an appendix to these Bylaws and shall be deemed for all purposes to be a part hereof.
SECTION 11. AMENDMENTS OR REPEAL
The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of this corporation; provided, however, the Board of Directors may not repeal or amend any bylaw that the stockholders have expressly provided may not be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of this corporation.
Notwithstanding any amendment to Section 10 hereof or repeal of these Bylaws, or of any amendment or repeal of any of the procedures that may be established by the Board pursuant to Section 10 hereof, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
The foregoing Bylaws were amended and restated by the Board of Directors on February 12, 2003, and amended on November 14, 2007.

FURTHER, THE RETENTION BY LANDLORD OF THE AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR HEREIN HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON, AFTER NEGOTIATION, AS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF LANDLORD'S DAMAGES. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PAYMENT OF SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED AS A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW, BUT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO LANDLORD. THE PARTIES HAVE SET FORTH THEIR INITIALS BELOW TO INDICATE THEIR AGREEMENT WITH THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION CONTAINED IN THIS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EACH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO EXPLAINED THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION AT THE TIME THIS NINTH AMENDMENT WAS EXECUTED.

BELLEVUE, Wash. (February 5, 2008)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2007.
"We are pleased that our revenue grew by fifteen percent sequentially and that overall our financial results exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter," said Jim Voelker, chairman and chief executive officer of InfoSpace. "These results cap a year of transformation for InfoSpace and value creation for our shareholders that included more than $500 million in special dividends. As a result of the successful sales of our mobile and directory businesses, we enter 2008 as a focused online search company with a talented team, loyal users, leading search technology, strong customer relationships and a growing distribution network. With these assets, we are confident that InfoSpace is well positioned for continued growth."
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $39.1 million, reflecting a $5.0 million increase over third quarter or a 15% increase, sequentially and year-over-year.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $57.8 million compared to net income of $27.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net income was impacted by a number of notable items, including:
 
 
 
 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a negative $42.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Full Year Results
Revenues for the full year 2007 were $140.5 million, reflecting a $13.3 million or 9% decrease over the full year 2006.
Net income for the full year 2007, including results from discontinued operations of $114.6 million, which included a gain from the sale of the Company's directory and mobile assets, was $16.9 million compared to a net loss of $15.1 million for the full year 2006.
For the full year 2007, Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a negative $47.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of a negative $28.3 million for the full year 2006.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments as of December 31, 2007 totaled $574.8 million. Of that total, the Company has paid or expects to pay approximately $360 million related to the $300 million special dividend, employee expenses related to the dividend, severance payments and deal related fees. After these payments, the Company expects its cash balance to be between $210 million and $215 million. At the end of the year, the Company had no debt obligations.
First Quarter 2008 Outlook
For the first quarter of 2008, the Company expects revenue to be between $35 million and $37 million. Additionally, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.5 million and $3.5 million and GAAP net income to be between breakeven and $1.4 million, or zero and $0.04 per share.
The Company's guidance excludes the potential impact of any future one-time gains or losses. The Adjusted EBITDA guidance above has been prepared in a manner consistent with the historical Adjusted EBITDA data provided above and in the accompanying table.
Conference Call and Webcast
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific/ 5 p.m. Eastern. The live Webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate Web site, at .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is calculated by adjusting GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments, net, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of our core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and the investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.

Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace" or the "Company") is furnishing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") this Current Report on Form 8-K/A to correct certain historical financial information reported in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on February 5, 2008.
On February 5, 2008, InfoSpace announced its preliminary financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2007, and contemporaneously furnished to the SEC these preliminary results on a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Initial Report"). Subsequent to the release of the preliminary results, the Company determined that certain adjustments should be made to its Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2007, and to its Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations were furnished to the SEC in an exhibit to the Initial Report.
The Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2007 reflect a non-cash adjustment to the gain on sale of discontinued operations, reducing the gain on sale of discontinued operations by $2.3 million. Additionally, the Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect certain reclassifications of income tax expense from continuing operations to the gain from the sale of discontinued operations. As a result of these adjustments, loss from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was $66.7 million and loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $90.7 million; net income for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was $55.5 million, and net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $14.6 million.
There were no changes to the Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2006.
The Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 reflect adjustments to net cash used by operating activities due to the Company's determination that it had incorrectly classified net cash flows from discontinued operations as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations. As a result, net cash used by operating activities that was presented in the Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows was overstated by $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and understated by $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company determined that, for the year ended December 31, 2007, it had incorrectly excluded certain excess tax benefits upon settlement of stock-based awards and as a result net cash used by operating activities was overstated by $6.1 million. In total, the result of the adjustments to the Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was an overstatement of net cash provided by operating activities of $26.3 million and an understatement of net cash provided by operating activities of $5.3 million, respectively. As a result of these adjustments, net cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $33.4 million, and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $60.8 million. There are no changes to the overall net increase in cash and cash equivalents on the Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31 2007 and 2006.
The Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three month and full year ended December 31, 2007 and the Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively. The information set forth in such revised statements attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 are preliminary, and are subject to change as a result of final management review and closing adjustments for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2007.
 
A reconciliation of differences between the Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2007 and the Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three month and full year ended December 31, 2007 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3, and a reconciliation of the differences between the Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006s is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.4. In addition to the changes discussed above, these reconciliations include adjustments that resulted from certain presentation reclassifications and rounding.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A and the exhibits attached hereto is being furnished to the SEC and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and this Current Report on Form 8-K/A and the exhibits attached hereto shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing by InfoSpace under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the Exchange Act.

On February 27, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace" or the "Company") approved the 2008 InfoSpace Executive Bonus Plan (the "2008 Executive Plan").
The 2008 Executive Plan provides for the payment of cash bonuses to eligible senior executives, which include the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Technology Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, and Chief Accounting Officer. The payment of these cash bonuses is based upon the attainment of specific consolidated revenue and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for non-recurring, non-operational and transitional cost items) objectives established by the Compensation Committee and the achievement by the executive of individual performance objectives reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. The target bonus amount for each of the participants in the 2008 Executive Plan is expected to be between 30% and 100% of such participant's base salary, as determined by the Compensation Committee and in accordance with the employment agreement of the relevant executive.
The foregoing description of the 2008 Executive Plan does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by the 2008 Executive Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) EXHIBITS.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 10.1
 
This plan document outlines the 2008 InfoSpace Executive Bonus Plan ("the Plan").
PLAN OBJECTIVES
 
 
 
 
EFFECTIVE DATE
The Plan is effective on January 1, 2008. However, the Plan may be changed at any time at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
PARTICIPATION ELIGIBILITY, PERFORMANCE PERIODS, AND PAYMENT TIMING
The positions eligible for the Plan for 2008 are listed below, along with the period for performance measurement and the timing of bonus payments:
 
If the executive leadership team changes composition, any additions to the Plan will be recommended by the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee.
BONUS TARGETS
The participant's annual bonus target will be between 30% and 100% of annual base salary. The participant's individual bonus target will be determined at the Compensation Committee's discretion based on a combination of factors including current-year operating plan challenges and risks, market pay competitiveness, and the past performance of the incumbent. The bonus target will also be set in accordance with the participant's employment agreement.
PLAN DESIGN
The Plan will have the following financial bonus components with the associated weightings, measurement periods, payment scales, and bonus achievement percentages:
 
 
2008 Executive Bonus Plan
Revenue and EBITDA Financial Targets
"Revenue" will be the total consolidated revenue that is reported externally by InfoSpace, Inc. "Adjusted EBITDA" will be earnings before income, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for non-recurring, non-operational and transitional cost items. Both Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets will match the 2008 operating plan targets approved by the Board of Directors.
Revenue and EBITDA Bonuses
For 2008, the Executive Bonus Payment Scale below will be used to calculate the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA bonuses on a quarterly basis.
 
 
 
 
 
Financial bonus amounts will be calculated and accrued on a quarterly basis, but actual bonus payments will be made in accordance with the payment timing listed by position on page one.
Individual Performance: MBO Achievement
Executives must achieve individual performance objectives (MBOs) to receive full bonus payments. Each executive will have 3-5 MBOs tied to bonus eligibility. MBOs will be prepared semiannually, and the Compensation Committee will review and approve the MBOs for each executive.
 
 
 
2008 Executive Bonus Plan
EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
In order to be eligible for a bonus payment under the Plan, and for a bonus to be considered to be earned under the Plan, participants must be employed for the entire performance period.
If an executive resigns on good terms, exercises termination for good reason, or takes an approved leave of absence during the performance period, the CEO has the discretion to recommend to the Compensation Committee to pay a partial bonus if the executive worked a significant portion of a performance period and achieved the majority of the MBOs, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement.
For executives who join the company after the beginning of a performance period but before the last 60 days of it, he or she may be eligible for prorated participation at the sole discretion of the CEO.
APPROVAL
All bonus payments made to executives will be submitted to the Compensation Committee for final approval. The Compensation Committee may adjust the final bonus amount as it deems appropriate. The Committee has complete discretion to adjust bonus awards to reflect changes in the industry, company, the executive's job duties or performance, or any other circumstance the Committee determines should impact bonus awards.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is calculated by adjusting GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments, net, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of our core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and the investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.

Revenues for the third quarter of 2008 were $39.5 million, reflecting a $5.6 million or 17% increase over the third quarter of 2007.

"Based on the success we've seen in driving traffic to our sites in both the second and third quarters, we will continue to invest in marketing programs for our flagship search site Dogpile.com. We are pleased with our progress and performance this year and are confident in our ability to continue this success despite the challenges in the macroeconomic environment."
Loss from continuing operations was $9.9 million in the third quarter of 2008, included in this amount is a charge of $11.0 million for unrealized losses on investments. This is compared to a loss from continuing operations of $6.6 million in the third quarter of 2007.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is calculated by adjusting GAAP net loss to exclude the effects of discontinued operations, income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, gain (loss) on investments, net, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of our core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net loss in accordance with GAAP accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.

On February 2, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of InfoSpace, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("InfoSpace" or the "Company"), elected William J. Lansing as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President and appointed Mr. Lansing to serve on the Board. Effective as of February 2, 2009, Mr. Lansing succeeds James F. Voelker, who is retiring from the position of Chief Executive Officer and President, but who will continue in his position as Chairman of the Board and will remain an employee of the Company.
Prior to joining InfoSpace, Mr. Lansing, age 50, served as Chief Executive Officer, President and as a director of ValueVision Media, Inc., a direct marketing company, from December 2003 to October 2007. From September 2001 to December 2003, Mr. Lansing served as a General Partner of General Atlantic LLC, a private equity investment firm. From April 2000 to August 2001, he was Chief Executive Officer of NBC Internet, Inc., an integrated Internet media company.

From November 1996 to May 1998, Mr. Lansing served as Vice President, Corporate Business Development for General Electric Company. Mr. Lansing serves on the Board of Directors of Fair Isaac Corporation, Digital River, Inc. and RightNow Technologies, Inc.
In connection with Mr. Lansing's election as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Lansing (the "Lansing Employment Agreement"), effective February 2, 2009 (the "Effective Date").
The Lansing Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Lansing will receive the following benefits: an annual base salary of $410,000, which is subject to annual review, but which in no event will be less than $410,000; eligibility for an annual performance bonus, the target of which to be set at not less than 100% of Mr. Lansing's then-current base salary; and a one-time lump-sum signing bonus equal to $175,000. In addition, on the Effective Date, Mr. Lansing received a stock option grant to purchase 1,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Option") and a grant of 200,000 restricted stock units covering the Company's common stock (the "RSU Grant"). Subject to the accelerated vesting provisions set forth in the Lansing Employment Agreement, the Option and the RSU Grant will be scheduled to vest as follows: 25% of the shares subject to the Option and 25% of the restricted stock units subject to the RSU Grant will be scheduled to vest on the first anniversary of the Effective Date, and 12.5% of the shares subject to the Option and 12.5% of the restricted stock units subject to the RSU Grant will be scheduled to vest each six-month period thereafter. All unvested stock options (including the Option), restricted stock units (including the RSU Grant), and other equity awards (collectively, the "Equity Awards") will become vested and immediately exercisable immediately prior to the effective date of a Change of Control (as defined in the Lansing Employment Agreement) if the acquiring or successor entity does not agree to assume or substitute for such awards.
The Lansing Employment Agreement will have an initial four (4) year term beginning on February 2, 2009, and will be automatically renewable for an additional two (2) year term on February 2, 2013, and thereafter, for additional one (1) year terms, unless, in any case, Mr. Lansing or the Company provides timely written notice of non-renewal. If the Company fails to renew the Lansing Employment Agreement, Mr. Lansing will be eligible to receive the following benefits: six (6) months continued payment of his annual salary; payments in equal installments over six (6) months of an amount equal to 50% of his target bonus; Company reimbursement for the cost of Mr. Lansing's COBRA premiums for no more than six (6) months following his termination; and the acceleration of vesting of 100% of his Equity Awards.
 
If Mr. Lansing's employment is terminated by InfoSpace without Cause (as defined in the Lansing Employment Agreement) or by Mr. Lansing for Good Reason (as defined in the Lansing Employment Agreement), and such termination occurs prior to February 2, 2010, Mr. Lansing will be eligible to receive the following severance benefits: twelve (12) months continued payment of his annual salary; payment in equal installments over twelve (12) months of an amount equal 100% of his target bonus; Company reimbursement for the cost of Mr. Lansing's COBRA premiums for no more than twelve (12) months following his termination; and the acceleration of vesting of 50% of his unvested Equity Awards.
If Mr. Lansing's employment is terminated by InfoSpace without Cause or by Mr. Lansing for Good Reason, and such termination occurs on or after February 2, 2010, Mr. Lansing will be eligible to receive the following severance benefits: twenty-four (24) months continued payment of his annual salary; payment in equal installments over twenty-four (24) months in an amount equal to 200% of his target bonus; Company reimbursement for the cost of Mr. Lansing's COBRA premiums for no more than twenty-four (24) months following his termination; and acceleration of vesting of 100% of his Equity Awards. In addition, if Mr. Lansing is terminated without Cause or terminates his employment for Good Reason, and in either event such termination is within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control, in addition to the benefits described directly above, Mr. Lansing will be eligible to receive a pro-rated bonus equal to 100% of his target bonus, payable in equal installments over the twelve (12) month period following the date of termination.
The foregoing summary of the Lansing Employment Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Lansing Employment Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Cause
(b) "". For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" is defined as the occurrence of any of the following:
Change of Control

(ii) Any merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation that has been approved by the stockholders of the Company, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 50% of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company;

Release
Exhibit A
(h) "". For purposes of this Agreement, "Section 409A Limit" means the lesser of two (2) times: (i) Employee's annualized compensation based upon the annual rate of pay paid to Employee during Employee's taxable year preceding Employee's taxable year of Employee's termination of employment as determined under, and with such adjustments as are set forth in, Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A)(1) and any Internal Revenue Service guidance issued with respect thereto; or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") for the year in which Employee's employment is terminated.

Code Section 409A
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no payments or benefits to be paid or provided to Employee, if any, pursuant to this Agreement, when considered together with any other payments or benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations and any guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A") (together, the "Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits") shall be paid or provided until Employee has a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Employee is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of Employee's "separation from service" (other than due to death), then the Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits, if any, otherwise due to the Employee on or within the six (6) month period following the date of "separation from service" and which are in excess of all applicable exclusions and exceptions will accrue during such six (6) month period and will become payable in a cash lump sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) on the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the Termination Date. All subsequent payments, if any, will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Employee dies following his "separation from service" but prior to the six (6) month anniversary of the Termination Date, then any payments delayed in accordance with this paragraph will be payable in a cash lump sum (less applicable withholding taxes) to Employee's estate as soon as administratively practicable after the date of Employee's death and all other Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit.

(c) Any amount paid under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations shall not constitute Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits for purposes of clause (a) above.
(d) Any amount paid under this Agreement that qualifies as a payment made as a result of an involuntary separation from service pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations that do not exceed the Section 409A Limit shall not constitute Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits for purposes of clause (a) above.
 
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all expenses eligible for reimbursement hereunder, and all in-kind benefits to be provided, shall be paid or provided, as applicable, to Employee promptly in accordance with the Company's customary practices (if any) applicable to the reimbursement of expenses, or the provision of in-kind benefits, of such type, but in any event by no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such expenses were incurred. The expenses incurred by Employee in any calendar year that are eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of in-kind benefits, under this Agreement shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year. Employee's right to receive any reimbursement or provision of in-kind benefits hereunder shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.
(f) This provision is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the payments and benefits to be provided hereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply.

This compares to loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $60.4 million, which included $61.6 million of employee expenses related to a special dividend, restructuring charges and income tax expense primarily related to placing a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset. For the year, loss from continuing operations was $16.5 million in 2008, compared with $84.5 million in 2007.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $3.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of negative $42.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.

Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 included a charge of $6.4 million for unrealized losses on investments.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income (loss) to exclude the effects of discontinued operations, income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments, net and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of its core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP accompanies the preliminary unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this release.

If an executive resigns on good terms, exercises termination for good reason, or takes an approved leave of absence during the performance period, the CEO has the discretion to recommend to the Compensation Committee to pay a partial bonus if the executive worked a significant portion of a performance period and achieved the majority of the MBOs, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement.
For executives who join the company after the beginning of a performance period but before the last 60 days of it, he or she may be eligible for prorated participation at the sole discretion of the CEO.
APPROVAL
All bonus payments made to executives will be submitted to the Compensation Committee for final approval. The Compensation Committee may adjust the final bonus amount as it deems appropriate. The Committee has complete discretion to adjust bonus awards to reflect changes in the industry, company, the executive's job duties or performance, or any other circumstance the Committee determines should impact bonus awards.

The information set forth in Item 5.03 is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On June 4, 2009, InfoSpace, Inc. ("" or the "") amended its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to the Amendment to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of InfoSpace, Inc., a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 (the ""). Pursuant to the Amendment, each share of InfoSpace's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""), that was outstanding as of the effective time of the Amendment was automatically reclassified into a new share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""), which Common Stock provides for certain transfer restrictions that are discussed below. The Amendment was adopted by InfoSpace's stockholders at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 4, 2009 (the ""). The proposal to adopt the Amendment was disclosed in InfoSpace's definitive proxy statement that was first distributed to its stockholder on or about March 31, 2009 in connection with the Annual Meeting.
InfoSpace
Company
Amendment
Old Common Stock
Common Stock
Annual Meeting
The Amendment prohibits certain future transfers of InfoSpace's capital stock (or options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into capital stock) that could adversely affect its ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") and certain income tax credits to reduce its federal income taxes. Except for the restrictions noted below, the reclassified shares of Common Stock have the same rights and preferences as the Old Common Stock.
The Amendment generally restricts any person or entity from attempting to transfer (which includes any direct or indirect acquisition, sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, pledge or other disposition) any of InfoSpace's stock (or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into such stock), to the extent that the transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a 5-percent stockholder of InfoSpace's stock for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (which the Amendment refers to as a "Five Percent Shareholder") or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing Five Percent Shareholder. The Amendment does not prevent transfers that are sales by a Five Percent Shareholder, although it does restrict any purchasers that seek to acquire shares from a Five Percent Shareholder to the extent that the purchaser is or would become a Five Percent Shareholder.
The Amendment provides that any transfer that violates the provisions of the Amendment shall be null and void and shall not be effective to transfer any record, legal, beneficial or any other ownership of the number of shares which result in the violation of the Amendment (which are referred to as ""). The purported transferee shall not be entitled to any rights as an InfoSpace stockholder with respect to the Excess Securities. Instead, the purported transferee would be required, upon demand by InfoSpace, to transfer the Excess Securities to an agent designated by InfoSpace for the limited purpose of consummating an orderly arm's-length sale of such shares. The net proceeds of the sale will be distributed first to reimburse the agent for any costs associated with the sale, second to the purported transferee to the extent of the price it paid, and finally any additional amount will go to the purported transferor, or, if the purported transferor cannot be readily identified, to a charity designated by the Board of Directors of InfoSpace. The Amendment also provides InfoSpace with various remedies to prevent or respond to a purported transfer which violates its provisions. In particular, the Amendment provides that any person who knowingly violates the Amendment, together with any persons in the same control group with such person, are jointly and severally liable to InfoSpace for such amounts as will put it in the same financial position as it would have been in had such violation not occurred.
ab initio
Excess Securities
 
Any amendments to or repeal of the transfer restriction provisions of the Amendment will require the affirmative vote of 66
 2
/
3
% of InfoSpace's then-outstanding shares of capital stock.
The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Description of Capital Stock
Upon the effectiveness of the filing of the Amendment, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 900,000,000 shares of Common Stock, 900,000,000 shares of Old Common Stock, and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share. The shares of the Common Stock are currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
Except for the restrictions on transfer set forth in the Amendment and described below, the shares of Common Stock have the same rights and preferences as shares of Old Common Stock.
The following summary of certain provisions of the Company's Common Stock does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the provisions of the Amendment.
COMMON STOCK
The holders of the Company's Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. There are no cumulative voting rights. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of the Company's preferred stock, the holders of the Company's Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Company's Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of the preferred stock of the Company. Holders of the Company's Common Stock have no preemptive rights or rights to convert their Common Stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock.
As a result of the Amendment, the Company's shares of Common Stock are also subject to transfer restrictions such that holders of Common Stock are restricted from attempting to transfer (which includes any direct or indirect acquisition, sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, pledge or other disposition) any of the share of Common Stock (or options, warrants or other rights to acquire the Company's stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock), to the extent that transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a 5-percent shareholder of the Company's stock for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the related Treasury Regulations (which are referred to as a "") or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing Five Percent Shareholder.
Five Percent Shareholder
Transfers that violate the provisions of the Amendment shall be null and void and shall not be effective to transfer any record, legal, beneficial or any other ownership of the number of shares which result in the violation of the Amendment (which shares are referred to as ""). The purported transferee shall not be entitled to any rights as a Company stockholder with respect to the Excess Securities. Instead, the purported transferee would be required, upon demand by the Company, to
ab initio
Excess Securities
 
transfer the Excess Securities to an agent designated by the Company for the limited purpose of consummating an orderly arm's-length sale of such shares. The net proceeds of the sale will be distributed first to reimburse the agent for any costs associated with the sale, second to the purported transferee to the extent of the price it paid, and finally any additional amount will go to the purported transferor, or, if the purported transferor cannot be readily identified, to a charity designated by the Board of Directors.
All shares of the Common Stock that have been issued in exchange for shares of the Old Common Stock in the reclassification are fully paid and nonassessable.
The reclassification effected by the Amendment has an "anti-takeover" effect because, among other things, the Common Stock issued in exchange for the Old Common Stock restricts the ability of a person, entity or group to accumulate more than five percent of the Company's Common Stock and the ability of persons, entities or groups now owning more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Common Stock from acquiring additional shares of the Company's Common Stock without the approval of the Company's Board of Directors.
OTHER ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS UNDER THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND RESTATED BYLAWS
The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the "") provides that any "Business Combination" (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) that has not been approved by at least two-thirds of the Board of Directors will require the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding capital stock of the Company. Any Business Combination that has been approved by at least two-thirds of the Board of Directors requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock of the Company; provided, however, that if a Business Combination approved by at least two-thirds of the Board of Directors is not otherwise required by law to be approved by the Company's stockholders, then no vote of stockholders would be required. This supermajority voting requirement to approve Business Combinations that have not been approved by at least two-thirds of the Board of Directors, which would include mergers and share exchanges, could discourage a potential acquiror that would seek to acquire the Company through such means.
Supermajority Vote Required to Approve a Change of Control.
Certificate of Incorporation
On July 19, 2002, in accordance with the terms of a Preferred Stock Rights Agreement (the "") between the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right (a "") to purchase one one-thousandth share of the Company's Series C Participating Preferred Stock ("") for each outstanding share of Common Stock. Unless earlier redeemed by the Company in accordance with the Rights Agreement, the Rights will become exercisable upon the earlier of (a) the tenth day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company's Board of Directors) after a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding, and (b) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company's Board of Directors) after a person or group announces a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Shares. The earlier of such dates is referred to as the "Distribution Date."
Preferred Stock Rights Agreement.
Rights Agreement
Right
Series C Preferred
The Rights approved by the Board of Directors are designed to protect and maximize the value of the outstanding equity interests in the Company in the event of an unsolicited attempt by an acquirer to take over the Company in a manner or on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. The Rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company and will not do so. Subject to the restrictions described above, the Rights may be redeemed by the Company at $0.001 per Right at any time prior to the Distribution Date. Accordingly, the Rights should not interfere with any merger or business combination approved by the Board of Directors.
 
However, the Rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the Company deemed undesirable by the Board of Directors. The Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms or in a manner not approved by the Company's Board of Directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon the negation, purchase or redemption of the Rights.
. The Company's Board of Directors has the ability to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the Company.
Undesignated Preferred Stock
. The Certificate of Incorporation provides for the division of the Company's Board of Directors into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the directors in each class serving for a three-year term, and one class being elected each year by the Company's stockholders. Directors may be removed only for cause. This system of electing and removing directors may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company and may maintain the incumbency of the Board of Directors, as it generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of directors.
Classified Board of Directors
. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company's stockholders may not act by written consent unless the matter has been properly brought before the stockholders by or at the direction of the Company's Board of Directors. This limit on the ability of the stockholders to act by written consent may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions. As a result, a holder controlling a majority of the Company's capital stock would not be able to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or the Restated Bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of stockholders called in accordance with the Restated Bylaws.
Limitations on the Ability of Stockholders to Act by Written Consent or Call a Special Meeting
. Under the Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws, the stockholders of the Company may call a special meeting only upon the request of holders of at least 30% of the outstanding shares. Additionally, the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and the President may call special meetings of stockholders.
Stockholder Meetings
. The Restated Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors. However, the Restated Bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.
Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals
. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless the certificate of incorporation of the company provides otherwise. The Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws provide that cumulative voting shall not exist with respect to the shares of the Company's capital stock.
No Cumulative Voting
. The amendment of certain of the above provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation regarding the transfer restrictions requires approval by holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Amendment of Charter Provisions
 
. The Company is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which regulates corporate acquisitions of public held companies. This law provides that specified persons who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly held Delaware corporation, or an interested stockholder, may not engage in business combinations with the corporation for a period of three years after the date on which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in advance of the a manner prescribed by Delaware law. The law defines the term "business combination" to include mergers, asset sales and other transactions in which the interested stockholder receives or could receive a financial benefit on other than a pro rata basis with other stockholders. This provision has an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Company's Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of the Company's Common Stock.
Anti-Takeover Statutes
The laws of the Washington, where the Company's principal executive offices are located, impose restrictions on certain transactions between certain foreign corporations and significant stockholders. Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "") prohibits a "Target Corporation," with certain exceptions, from engaging in certain "Significant Business Transactions" with a person or group of persons which beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting securities of the Target Corporation (an "") for a period of five years after such acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the Target Corporation's board of directors prior to the time of acquisition. Such prohibited transactions include, among other things, a merger or consolidation with, disposition of assets to, or issuance or redemption of stock to or from, the Acquiring Person, termination of 5% or more of the employees of the Target Corporation as a result of the Acquiring Person's acquisition of 10% or more of the shares or allowing the Acquiring Person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a stockholder. After the five-year period, a Significant Business Transaction may take place as long as it complies with certain fair price provisions of the statute or is approved at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. A Target Corporation includes a foreign corporation if (i) the corporation has a class of voting stock registered pursuant to Section 12 or 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) the corporation's principal executive office is located in Washington, (iii) any of (a) more than 10% of the corporation's stockholders of record are Washington residents, (b) more than 10% of its shares of record are owned by Washington residents or (c) 1,000 or more of its stockholders of record are Washington residents, (iv) a majority of the corporation's employees are Washington residents or more than 1,000 Washington residents are employees of the corporation and (v) a majority of the corporation's tangible assets are located in Washington or the corporation has more than $50 million of tangible assets located in Washington. A corporation may not "opt out" of this statute. If the Company meets the definition of a Target Corporation, Chapter 23B.19 of the WBCA may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.

Transfer Restrictions
(a) From and after the Effective Date and prior to the Restriction Release Date, no Transfer shall be permitted, and any such purported Transfer shall be void , to the extent that after giving effect to such purported Transfer (or any series of Transfers of which such Transfer is a part), either (i) any Person or group of Persons shall become a Five Percent Shareholder, or (ii) the Percentage Stock Ownership interest in the Corporation of any Five Percent Shareholder shall be increased.

ab initio
(b) The restrictions contained in this Article 4 are for the purposes of reducing the risk that any "ownership change" of the Corporation Securities (as defined in the Code) may limit the Corporation's ability to utilize its Tax Benefits. In connection therewith, and to provide for effective policing of these provisions, a Restricted Holder who proposes to Acquire Corporation Securities shall, prior to the date of the proposed Acquisition, request in writing (a "") that the Board of Directors of the Corporation (or a committee thereof that has been appointed by the Board of Directors) review the proposed Acquisition and authorize or not authorize the proposed Acquisition in accordance with this Section 4.3.2(b) of Article 4.

The Board of Directors may authorize an Acquisition by a Restricted Holder, if it determines, in its sole discretion, that, after taking into account the preservation of the Tax Benefits, such Acquisition would be in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders. Any determination by the Board of Directors not to authorize a proposed Acquisition by a Restricted Holder shall cause such proposed Acquisition to be deemed a Prohibited Transfer. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, impose any conditions that it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection with authorizing any such Acquisition by a Restricted Holder. In addition, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, require such representations from the Restricted Holder or such opinions of counsel to be rendered by counsel selected by the Board of Directors, in each case as to such matters as the Board of Directors may determine.

Treatment of Excess Securities
(a) No employee or agent of the Corporation shall record any Prohibited Transfer, and the purported transferee of a Prohibited Transfer (the "") shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the Corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Corporation Securities which are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the ""). The Purported Transferee shall not be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities to any rights of stockholders of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof. Once the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, such Corporation Securities shall cease to be Excess Securities.
Purported Transferee
Excess Securities
(b) If the Board of Directors determines that a Prohibited Transfer has been recorded by an agent or employee of the Corporation notwithstanding the prohibition in Section 4.3.3(a) of this Article 4, such recording and the Prohibited Transfer shall be void and have no legal effect and, upon written demand by the Corporation, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported Transferee's possession or control, together with any dividends or other distributions that were received by the Purported Transferee from the Corporation with respect to the Excess Securities (the ""), to an agent designated by the Board of Directors (the ""). In the event of an attempted Prohibited Transfer involving the purchase or Acquisition of Corporation Securities in violation of this Article 4 by a Restricted Holder, the Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers, which may include the Corporation or the purported transferor, the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more arm's-length transactions (including over a national securities exchange or national securities quotation system on which the Corporation Securities may be traded); provided, however, that the Agent, in its sole discretion, shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if, in the Agent's discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the market for the Corporation Securities, would adversely affect the value of the Corporation Securities or would be in violation of applicable securities laws. If the Purported Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the Corporation's demand to surrender the Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the Corporation grants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds not exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to Section 4.3.3(c) of this Article 4 if the Agent, rather than the Purported Transferee, had resold the Excess Securities.
ab initio
Prohibited Distributions
Agent
(c) The Agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and, if the Purported Transferee had previously resold the Excess Securities, any amounts received by it from a Purported Transferee, as follows: (i) first, to reimburse itself to the extent necessary to
cover its costs and expenses incurred in accordance with its duties hereunder; (ii) second, to reimburse the Purported Transferee for the amounts paid by the Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or in the case of any Prohibited Transfer by gift, devise or inheritance or any other Prohibited Transfer without consideration, the fair market value, calculated on the basis of the closing market price for the Corporation Securities on the day before the Prohibited Transfer), and (iii) third, the remainder, if any, to the original transferor, or, if the original transferor cannot be readily identified, to an entity designated by the Corporation's Board of Directors that is described in Section 501(c) of the Code, contributions to which must be eligible for deduction under each of Sections 170(b)(1)(A), 2055 and 2522 of the Code. The recourse of any Purported Transferee with respect of any Prohibited Transfer shall be limited to the amount payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 4.3.3.(c) of this Article 4. Except as may be required by law, in no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to this Article 4 inure to the benefit of the Corporation or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover expenses incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder.
(d) If the Purported Transferee fails to surrender the Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof to the Agent within thirty (30) days from the date on which the Corporation makes a demand pursuant to Section (3)(b) of this Article 4, then the Corporation may take such actions as it deems necessary to enforce the provisions hereof, including the institution of legal proceedings to compel such surrender.
(e) If any Person shall knowingly violate, or knowingly cause any other Person under control of such Person (a "") to violate this Article 4, then that Person and any Controlled Person shall be jointly and severally liable for, and shall pay to the Corporation, such amount as will, after taking account of all taxes imposed with respect to the receipt or accrual of such amount and all costs incurred by the Corporation as a result of such violation, put the Corporation in the same financial position as it would have been in had such violation not occurred.
Controlled Person
. . Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 9 of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation may only amend or repeal any of the provisions set forth in this Section 4.3 by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote thereon.

(a) All certificates reflecting Corporation Securities on or after the Effective Date shall, until the Restriction Release Date, bear a conspicuous legend in substantially the following form:
THE TRANSFER OF SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE FOUR OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF INFOSPACE, INC., AS AMENDED AND IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CORPORATION UPON REQUEST.
(b) The Corporation shall have the power to make appropriate notations upon its stock transfer records and to instruct any transfer agent, registrar, securities intermediary or depository with respect to the requirements of this Article 4 for any uncertificated Corporation Securities or Corporation Securities held in an indirect holding system.
(c) Nothing contained in this Article 4 shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to take such other action to the extent permitted by law as it deems necessary or advisable to preserve the Corporation's Tax Benefits. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the power to determine all matters necessary for determining compliance with this Article 4, including, without limitation, determining (i) the identification of Five Percent Shareholders and Restricted Holders, (ii) whether a Transfer or proposed Transfer is a Prohibited Transfer, (iii) the Percentage Stock Ownership in the Corporation of any Five Percent Shareholders and Restricted Holders, (iv) whether an instrument constitutes a Corporation Security, (v) the amount (or fair market value) due to a Purported Transferee, (vi) the interpretation of the provisions of this Article 4, and (vii) any other matters which the Board of Directors deems relevant. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Article 4, including any definition used herein, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions with respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or knowledge of the circumstances. In the event that this Article 4 requires an action by the Board of Directors but fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of this Article 4. All such actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations that are done or made by the Board of Directors in good faith shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Corporation, the Agent, and all other parties to a Transfer; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may delegate all or any portion of its duties and powers under this Article 4 to a committee of the Board of Directors as it deems advisable or necessary.
(d) Nothing contained in this Article 4 shall be construed to give any Person other than the Corporation or the Agent any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Article 4. This Article 4 shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Corporation and the Agent.
(e) If any provision of this Article 4 or the application of any such provision to any Person or under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Article 4.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Certificate of Amendment to the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been executed by a duly authorized officer of the corporation on this the 4th day of June 2009.

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., August 5, 2009 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSP) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009.
"I am extremely pleased with our results in the second quarter," said Will Lansing, president and chief executive officer of InfoSpace.

At the same time, we continue to invest in new product initiatives including the launch of two new metasearch sites in the quarter."

Second Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
InfoSpace:

Conference Call and Webcast

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income (loss) to exclude the effects of discontinued operations, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, gain (loss) on investments, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, resolution of gain contingencies, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of its core business operating results.

Payment of Additional Amounts
. Employee agrees that the foregoing consideration represents settlement in full of all outstanding obligations owed to Employee by the Company and its officers, managers, supervisors, agents and employees.

any and all claims relating to, or arising from, Employee's right to purchase, or actual purchase of shares of stock of the Company, including, without limitation, any claims for fraud, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty under applicable state corporate law, and securities fraud under any state or federal law;

. The Parties represent that they are not aware of any claim by either of them other than the claims that are released by this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that he has been advised by legal counsel and is familiar with the principle that a general release does not extend to claims which the releasor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the releasee.

Employee represents that he has no lawsuits, claims, or actions pending in his name, or on behalf of any other person or entity, against the Company or any other person or entity referred to herein.

Non-Solicitation
. Employee agrees that for the one (1) year period beginning after the Termination Date, that Employee shall not compete with the Company as required pursuant to the Supplementary Agreement.
Non-Competition
. The Parties understand and acknowledge that this Agreement constitutes a compromise and settlement of disputed claims.

Employee further agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any claims, demands, deficiencies, penalties, assessments, executions, judgments, or recoveries by any government agency against the Company for any amounts claimed due on account of Employee's failure to pay federal or state taxes or damages sustained by the Company by reason of any such claims, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
Tax Consequences
. The Parties shall each bear their own costs, expert fees, attorneys' fees and other fees incurred in connection with this Agreement.
Costs
. Employee agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any and all loss, costs, damages or expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees or expenses incurred by the Company arising out of the breach of this Agreement by Employee, or from any false representation made herein by Employee, or from any action or proceeding which may be commenced, prosecuted or threatened by Employee or for Employee's benefit, upon Employee's initiative, or with Employee's aid or approval, contrary to the provisions of this Agreement. Employee further agrees that in any such action or proceeding, this Agreement may be pled by the Company as a complete defense, or may be asserted by way of counterclaim or cross-claim.

The Parties agree that the prevailing party in any arbitration shall be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award. The Parties agree that the prevailing party in any arbitration shall be awarded its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

The Parties hereby agree to waive their right to have any dispute between them resolved in a court of law by a judge or jury.

Neither party has relied upon any representations or statements made by the other party hereto which are not specifically set forth in this Agreement.
No Representations

Entire Agreement
. The failure of any party to insist upon the performance of any of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, or the failure to prosecute any breach of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed thereafter as a waiver of any such terms or conditions. This entire Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or failure of performance had occurred.
No Waiver
. Any modification or amendment of this Agreement, or additional obligation assumed by either party in connection with this Agreement, shall be effective only if placed in writing and signed by both Parties or by authorized representatives of each party.
No Oral Modification

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On September 18, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of InfoSpace, Inc. (the "Company") elected Braden Kelly to serve as a Class III director on the Board, effective as of date of such election until his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation, or removal from office. In connection with Mr. Kelly's election to the Board, and effective as of the date of such election, Mr. Kelly was also appointed to serve as a member of the following committees of the Board: the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee, and the Special Litigation Committee.
Mr. Kelly is currently a senior advisor to Health Evolution Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm. Additionally, Mr. Kelly serves on the board of edo Interactive, Inc., a developer in digital payment and marketing platforms. From 1995 to 2006, Mr. Kelly was with General Atlantic LLC, a private equity investment firm focused on growth investing, where he served as a partner and managing director. Prior to joining General Atlantic, Mr. Kelly worked in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley & Co. as a member of the mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring department.
Mr. Kelly will participate in the Company's non-employee director compensation arrangements, which were revised by the Board on September 18, 2009. A summary of the revised non-employee director compensation arrangements is provided below in Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
On September 18, 2009, immediately prior to the election of Mr. Kelly to the Board, the Board approved and adopted a revised compensation plan for non-employee directors (the "Revised Director Compensation Plan").

The options granted pursuant to each Initial Grant and Annual Grant shall be fully vested immedi ately upon grant, and shall have an exercise price per share equal to the closing selling price for the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., October 28, 2009 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSP) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009.

Adjusted EBITDA was $7.1 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $6.6 million for the third quarter of 2008.
Net income for the third quarter of 2009 was $1.8 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to net loss of $9.9 million, or $0.29 per share, for the third quarter of 2008.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income (loss) to exclude the effects of discontinued operations, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments, net, and other income, net (including such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of its core business operating results. InfoSpace believes that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing InfoSpace's performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP accompanies the preliminary unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this release.

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., January 6, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSP), a leading developer of metasearch products, announced today that it has increased its fourth quarter 2009 guidance for revenues, income before income taxes, and Adjusted EBITDA, and will provide further commentary at upcoming investor conferences. Company executives will participate in both the Citi Global Entertainment Media and Telecommunications Conference and the Needham Growth Stock Conference.
Revised Fourth Quarter 2009 Guidance
Due to the impending investor conferences and proximity to the end of the quarter, InfoSpace, Inc. is updating its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2009. The Company now expects revenues for the fourth quarter to be between $69 million and $70 million or 88% to 90% growth from the fourth quarter of 2008; income before income taxes to be between $6.3 million to $7.5 million compared to loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008; and Adjusted EBITDA to be between $10 million and $11 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company previously provided an estimate of fourth quarter revenues to be between $57 million and $60 million; income before income taxes of between $3.4 million and $4.4 million; and Adjusted EBITDA to be between $7.4 million and $8.4 million. Fourth quarter guidance and revised fourth quarter guidance reflect a one-time benefit from a net tax refund received in the fourth quarter of 2009, which increased income before income taxes by $3.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA by $2.4 million. The Company is not providing an update to its expected income tax expense at this time because its annual income tax provision is not yet complete. Thus, the Company is not providing revised guidance for its expected net income at this time.
"Our upward revisions are due to continued strength in our distribution business," said David Binder, chief financial officer of InfoSpace. "During the quarter we saw stronger volume from both existing customers and newly launched accounts that contributed to the better than expected top line and gross profit."
Citi Global Entertainment Media and Telecommunications Conference
Will Lansing, president and chief executive officer, and David Binder, chief financial officer, will present at the Citi Global Entertainment Media and Telecommunications Conference in San Francisco, CA. The presentation is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. Pacific / 1:30 p.m. Eastern on Thursday, January 7, 2010.
Needham Growth Stock Conference
David Binder, chief financial officer, and John Rodkin, general manager of search, will present at the Needham Growth Stock Conference in New York, NY. The presentation is scheduled to begin at 10:50 a.m. Pacific / 1:50 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, January 12, 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., February 3, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSP) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2009.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $70.5 million, reflecting a $33.7 million, or 92%, increase from the fourth quarter of 2008. Revenues for the year were $207.6 million in 2009, reflecting a $50.9 million, or 32%, increase over 2008.
"InfoSpace delivered another strong quarter, capping a year of solid growth and profitability," said Will Lansing, president and chief executive officer of InfoSpace.

In addition, we continued to invest in new initiatives in our owned and distributed search products, as well as in initiatives beyond search."
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $10.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $7.9 million, or $0.23 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2008. Net income for the fourth quarter includes tax benefits of $5.7 million which includes a $3.3 million one-time tax benefit from a net business tax refund. Net income for 2009 was $9.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $18.7 million, or $0.54 per share, for 2008.
Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, and includes a $2.4 million one-time tax benefit from a net business tax refund in the fourth quarter of 2009.

A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after the call through February 13, 2010 at 9:00 p.m. Pacific (February 14, 2010 at 12:00 a.m. Eastern).
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to exclude the effects of discontinued operations, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, gain (loss) on investments, net and other income, net (which includes such items as interest income, gain contingency resolutions, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
InfoSpace's management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of its core business operating results. InfoSpace uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. InfoSpace believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), which the Company's management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements in this release. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income (loss).

InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace" or the "Company") is furnishing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") this Current Report on Form 8-K/A to correct certain historical financial information reported in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on February 3, 2010 (the "Form 8-K").
On February 3, 2010, InfoSpace issued a press release announcing its preliminary financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2009, and furnished the press release on Exhibit 99.1 to the SEC on Form 8-K. Subsequent to the release of the preliminary results, the Company identified a non-cash error in the income tax provision. This error resulted in an overstatement of net income in the Company's Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 and an understatement of additional paid-in capital in the Company's Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 in the amount of $2.4 million. This also resulted in an overstatement of net cash provided by operating activities and an understatement of net cash provided by financing activities of $5.2 million in the Company's Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2009. The overall net increase in cash and cash equivalents did not change for the year.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 (as revised) was $7.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $7.9 million, or $0.23 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2008. Net income for 2009 (as revised) was $7.4 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $18.7 million, or $0.54 per share, for 2008.
Corrected Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2009, the Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 and the Revised Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2009 are attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Reconciliations of the revisions to these financial statements are attached as Exhibit 99.2.

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On March 17, 2010, the Board of Directors of InfoSpace, Inc. approved and adopted the 2010 Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides for annual performance-based cash bonuses to the Company's executive officers. The target bonus amount for each participant is between 40% and 100% of such participant's base salary.
The available bonus for each participant is based upon the Company's achievement of three financial performance measures: (A) 20% of bonus-total revenue; (B) 20% of bonus-normalized revenue (defined as total revenue less specific volatile distribution accounts); and (C) 60% of bonus-normalized EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding non-cash stock compensation and non-recurring, non-operating and transitional cost items). The performance targets established for the Plan will correspond to the operating plan targets approved by the Board of Directors. Available bonuses range from zero to 150% for each component based upon actual performance ranging from zero to 135%. A minimum achievement of 80% of a performance target is required to receive any payment. The available bonus for the achievement of each performance component is independent from the achievement of the other components.
The annual bonus plan also provides discretion to the CEO to apply a multiplier ranging from 80% to 120% of the available bonus for each participant based on the satisfaction of individual performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, so long as the CEO's adjustments have a net $0 effect. Thereafter, the bonus amounts must be approved by the Compensation Committee, which may further adjust the bonus amount as it deems appropriate to reflect changes in the industry, the Company, the executive's job duties or performance, or any other circumstance the Compensation Committee determines should impact bonus awards.
The foregoing description of Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

This plan document outlines the InfoSpace Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan").
PLAN OBJECTIVES
The Plan is effective on January 1, 2010. However, the Plan may be changed at any time at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
PARTICIPATION ELIGIBILITY, PERFORMANCE PERIODS, AND PAYMENT TIMING
The positions eligible for the Plan are listed below, along with the period for performance measurement and the timing of bonus payments:
If the executive leadership team changes composition, any additions to the Plan will be recommended by the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee.
The participant's annual bonus target will be between 40% and 100% of annual base salary. The participant's individual bonus target will be determined at the Compensation Committee's discretion based on a combination of factors including current-year operating plan challenges and risks, market pay competitiveness, and the past performance of the incumbent. The bonus target will also be set in accordance with the participant's employment agreement.
The Plan will have the following financial bonus components with the associated weightings, measurement periods, payment scales, and bonus achievement percentages:
Financial Targets
The financial measures used to determine the bonus achievement are defined as:
The Executive Bonus Payment Scale below will be used to calculate the available amounts to be paid to executives based on the Total Revenue, Normalized Revenue and Normalized EBITDA performance of the Company.
Executives must achieve individual performance objectives (MBOs) to receive full bonus payments. Each executive will have multiple MBOs tied to bonus achievement. MBOs will be prepared annually, and the Compensation Committee will review and approve the MBOs for each executive.
In order to be eligible for a bonus payment under the Plan, and for a bonus to be considered to be earned under the Plan, participants must be employed at the end of the performance period.
Executives who join the Company or are promoted to an eligible position after the beginning of a performance period will be eligible for pro-rated participation.
Executives who leave the plan or the Company before the end of a performance period will be reconciled according to the terms outlined in their employment contracts and/or severance agreements.
All bonus payments made to executives will be submitted to the Compensation Committee for final approval. The Compensation Committee may adjust the final bonus amount as it deems appropriate. The Compensation Committee has complete discretion to adjust bonus awards to reflect changes in the industry, Company, the executive's job duties or performance, or any other circumstance the Compensation Committee determines should impact bonus awards.

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., May 5, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSP) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2010 were $61.8 million, reflecting a $22.7 million or 58% increase from the first quarter of 2009. Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $1.5 million, or $0.04 earnings per diluted share, compared to net loss of $5.0 million, or $0.14 loss per share for the first quarter of 2009.
"InfoSpace performed well in the first quarter, with strong revenue and cash flow growth versus the same period last year," said Will Lansing, president and chief executive officer of InfoSpace. "We continue to produce positive financial results through the performance of our search business while developing new products to diversify the business model and position us better for future growth."
Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, was $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2009.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March 31, 2010 totaled $231.4 million. At the end of the quarter, the Company had no debt obligations.
"During the first quarter, we purchased the assets of one of our largest distribution partners, Make The Web Better," said David Binder, chief financial officer of InfoSpace. "By acquiring this traffic, we expect to generate greater cash flow than through the existing partnership. This deal is another way for us to maximize the financial performance of our search business while leaving us with plenty of cash for strategic acquisitions."

InfoSpace
 
 
 
Second Quarter Outlook
For the second quarter of 2010, the Company expects revenues to be between $51 million and $55 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be between $9.5 million and $10.5 million and net income to be between $2.5 million and $3.5 million, or $0.07 and $0.09 per diluted share.
Conference Call and Webcast
A conference call will be held today at 6 a.m. Pacific / 9 a.m. Eastern. The live Webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate Web site at .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments, and other income (loss), net (which includes such items as interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
InfoSpace's management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of its core business operating results. InfoSpace uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. InfoSpace believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), which the Company's management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements in this release. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income (loss).

The transaction closed on May 10, 2010, and includes a purchase price of $8 million in cash, plus the assumption of certain liabilities, not to exceed $5.9 million.
"Mercantila will provide InfoSpace with a foundational technology platform and represents the first step in our differentiated e-commerce strategy," said William J. Lansing, chief executive officer of InfoSpace. "Through organic growth and development of Mercantila's current platform, along with other acquisitions, we intend to become a strong e-commerce player. We believe that e-commerce represents an attractive segment in which InfoSpace can build a profitable business, accelerate the monetization of our NOLs, and create additional shareholder value."
The acquisition is part of InfoSpace's strategy to expand its online audience beyond search. InfoSpace will build on Mercantila's strong drop-ship supplier platform to support InfoSpace's low asset intensive approach to e-commerce. Mercantila owns more than 200 specialty stores on the Web under a range of domain names and has partnered with more than 1,000 fulfillment partners to supply its products.
Mercantila will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary, under the leadership of Nikhil Behl, its former chief merchandising officer and newly appointed chief executive officer of the subsidiary.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, loss (gain) on investments, and other loss (income), net (which includes such items as adjustments to the fair values of contingent liabilities related to business combinations, interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
InfoSpace's management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of its operating results. InfoSpace uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. InfoSpace believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), which the Company's management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements in this release. Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income (loss).

Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On September 14, 2010, InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace") entered into an agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") to settle all claims in the stockholder derivative action brought against certain current and former officers and directors of InfoSpace brought by Anne D. Manos and James N. Mercer (the "Derivative Action"). The Derivative Action is further described in the "Litigation" section of "Note 7: Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which is subject to court approval, InfoSpace will receive a gross amount of $26.65 million as consideration for the dismissal of all claims in the Derivative Action. This amount will be provided to InfoSpace in the form of cash, forgone contractual obligations of InfoSpace, and surrendered securities. The net final value of Settlement Agreement is uncertain because InfoSpace is obligated to pa y certain fees and expenses for attorneys and others retained by InfoSpace, a Special Litigation Committee of its Board of Directors, plaintiffs, and defendants. While the exact amount of these fees and expenses are currently unknown, they are anticipated to account for a material percentage of the gross amount received by InfoSpace. In addition, InfoSpace has agreed to undertake certain specified corporate governance reforms and to avoid, in connection with any future special stockholder dividends, certain actions that were the subject of the Derivative Action. The proposed settlements do not involve any admission of wrongdoing or liability, and there has been no adjudication of the merits of the underlying claims.
The parties to the Settlement Agreement are as follows: the plaintiffs (Anne D. Manos and James N. Mercer), the nominal defendant (InfoSpace, Inc.), the Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors of InfoSpace, Inc., the named defendants (James F. Voelker, John E. Cunningham, IV , Jules Haimovitz, Richard D. Hearney, Lewis M. Taffer, George M. Tronsrue, III, Vanessa A. Wittman, Allen Hsieh, Brian T. McManus, Steven L. Elfman, and R. Bruce Easter, Jr.), and three non-parties to the Derivative Action (former InfoSpace Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, John Foster, Syzygy Consulting Group, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, PC) (collectively, the "Settling Parties").
The Settling Parties intend to jointly request that the Superior Court in King County, Washington preliminarily approve the proposed settlement and then, following certain procedures to be set by the Court, subsequently enter final judgment providing for approval of the Settlement Agreement, dismissing the Derivative Action with prejudice, permanently enjoining the prosecution of any of the specified released claims against certain Settling Parties, and awarding attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses to the plaintiffs' counsel in an amount to be determined by the Court. There can be no assurance the court will approve the Settlement Agreement or any of the terms requested by the Settling Parties.
A copy of the Settlement Agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
On September 14, 2010, in connection with the Settlement Agreement described above in Item 1.01, InfoSpace entered into an agreement to release certain insurance carriers from any further liability for a specific set of insurance and excess insurance policies. As a result, InfoSpace will have no further insurance coverage under those specific directors' and officers' liability and company reimbursement policies purchased by InfoSpace for claims made during the period from December 15, 2008 to December 15, 2009 or for claims made after that period that are substantially related to claims made during that period.

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between InfoSpace, Inc. and its Chairman James F. Voelker (as attached as Exhibit 10.8 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-K filed by InfoSpace, Inc. on November 10, 2008, the "Employment Agreement") provides that the Employment Term of Mr. Voelker, as defined in the Employment Agreement, will end on December 31, 2010 unless extended by the Company and Mr. Voelker, with notice of such extension to be provided at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Employment Term. Mr. Voelker and the Company have decided not to extend the term of employment. Accordingly, on September 21, 2010, the Company provided Mr. Voelker with the notice contemplated by Section 4 of the Employment Agreement that his employment by InfoSpace, Inc. will end on December 31, 2010. Section 3 of the Agreement provides that during his term of employment, Mr. Voelker is to serve as Chairman of the Board, subject to any required Board and/or stockholder approval. Mr. Voelker will rema in on the Board after the end of the Employment Term, but, per NASDAQ listing rules, will not be considered an independent director. InfoSpace intends to appoint an independent Chairman of the Board to serve as of January 1, 2011. The Employment Agreement provides for a $2.4 million payment to Mr. Voelker on the six month anniversary of the separation from service. Although this payment will be made to Mr. Voelker in the first quarter of 2011, the Company expects to recognize this expense in its third quarter 2010 financial results.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
[  ]   Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [  ]   Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [  ]   Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
 
 
Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure
 
InfoSpace, Inc. is disclosing that it has reached an agreement on attorneys' fees with the plaintiffs and their attorneys in the stockholder derivative action against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company brought by Anne D. Manos and James N. Mercer. The Company previously disclosed, in a Current Report on Form 8 K filed on September 17, 2010, that the parties to this lawsuit had executed a settlement agreement, a copy of which was attached as an exhibit to that Form 8 K. At the time of execution of the settlement agreement, the Company and plaintiffs had not reached agreement on the amount of legal fees and expenses that plaintiffs' attorneys would seek from the court. The Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors of InfoSpace, Inc. has subsequently reached agreement with the plaintiffs and their attorneys that the plaintiffs will submit a fee and expense request to the court in the amount of $5.33 million and the Company will not oppose that request. As with the other terms of the proposed settlement, the agreed upon fee and expense award will be subject to court approval.
As a result of this agreement, the Company is now providing an estimate of the Company's expected net cash benefit from the settlement agreement. After payment of certain fees and expenses for attorneys and others retained by the Company, the Special Litigation Committee, plaintiffs, and defendants, and excluding any non cash recovery, the Company estimates that its net cash recovery as a result of the settlement will be between $12 million and $14 million. Such recovery would only occur following a final judgment approving the settlement by the court and either the exhaustion of any appeals from that judgment or the expiration of the deadline for appeal of that judgment. Because the agreed upon fee amount and the settlement itself remain subject to final court approval, there can be no assurance that this amount will be received by the Company.
This Current Report on Form 8 K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's expectations, estimates, and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual future results may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation: unexpectedly high fees and expenses from other attorneys and experts that the Company has an obligation to pay; a decision by the court to reject the settlement; or any other event that could result in the ligation resuming. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Current Report. InfoSpace, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect n ew information, events, or circumstances after the date of this Current Report.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this GSA by persons duly authorized as of the GSA Effective Date set forth below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Google has observed a significant increase in the number of reports of software that is engaging in deceptive, malicious and other annoying practices that significantly diminish user perception and enjoyment of the internet. These practices include but are not limited to installing software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called "drive-by download"), inundating end users with advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent, obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user's ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.
Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to Google's business.
With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are used to access our search and/or advertising syndication services. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not, access Google services using one or more of your Applications unless you ensure that those Applications comply with these Guidelines. Examples of accessing Google services in this context include Applications that send end user queries or other information to Google to generate search or ad results, or Applications that alter browser or other application settings to permit error traffic to be sent to Google to generate search or ad results.
For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any Application that is not used to access, or is not bundled with any Application that is used to access, Google services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not used to access Google services.
In these Guidelines: (a) "you" and "your" refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) "Application" means any application, plug-in, helper, component or other executable code that runs on a user's computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging, chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.
Google welcomes input about these Guidelines from you and from other interested parties, and is always willing to consider revisions as appropriate to encourage innovation while protecting against deceptive, unfair and harmful practices. Accordingly, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Exhibits, from time to time as provided in Section 10 below.
If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your Google account manager.
 
You may access Google services from Applications only to the extent permitted in the signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1) has been approved by Google for the purpose of accessing Google services in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google's approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a written request.
1.1. .
Approval and Ongoing Compliance
          The incorporation of Google services into your Application must conform to the implementation requirements set forth in your agreement with Google. For example, in the case of Applications that access Google's WebSearch and/or AdSense for Search Services, end user queries initiated from your Application must resolve to a Google-approved Web page on a permitted Web site as provided in your agreement with Google (refer to your agreement for a complete description of the scope of approved Web pages and sites). In any event, unless your agreement with Google expressly authorizes otherwise, Google results may only appear on the Web pages expressly approved by Google for such display, and, except for the display of those pages in the main content area of a Web browser, Google results may not appear anywhere in your Applications (, Google results may not appear in the "chrome" of your Application unless your agreement expressly contemplates otherwise).
1.2. .
Implementation
e.g.
Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the
1.3. .
No Google Branding or Attribution
 
 
 
extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You may not access Google services from Any Application unless you and your distribution and bundling partners design the installation of your Application in a manner that ensures that it is installed by end users in a knowing and willful manner  , no "drive-by" downloads or installs. By "distribution partner" we mean any third party who distributes your Application and by "bundling partner" we mean any third party who installs your Application in combination with or alongside one or more other Applications. At a minimum, compliance with this provision requires that, prior to installing your Application, you and any third party distributing or bundling your Application:
4.1. .
Disclosure and Consent before Installation
e.g.
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.1 will not apply to those of your Applications that are installed on computers prior to sale.
You may not access Google services from any Application that (1) collects or transmits to any entity other than the end user personally identifiable information, or (2) collects or transmits information related to a user's computer or Internet usage or activity in a manner that could collect or transmit such user's personally identifiable information (such as through keystroke logging), unless prior to the occurrence of any such collection or transmission you:
4.2. .
Disclosure and Consent for Collection and Transmission of Personally Identifiable Information
first
 
 
 
 
 
You may not access Google services from any Application that makes a change to any operating system or Application data setting which will impact the user experience of other Applications (, changing the browser default home page or changing the default application for a file type, such as the default email, browser or media player application), unless prior to making such change you:
4.3. .
Disclosure and Consent for Setting Changes
e.g.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no disclosure and consent need be made for changes to operating system or Application data settings that have only a minor impact on user experience, such as adding a small number of bookmarks to the browser menu or adding an item to a start menu, and (ii) the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.3 will not apply to those setting changes that may be made prior to sale to the end user.
In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom) and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (, in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See for sample disclosure and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.
4.4. .
Method of Disclosure and Consent
e.g.
Exhibit A
You may not access Google services from any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user's use of his or her computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must be disclosed in your privacy policy.
4.5. .
EULA and Privacy Policy
 
 
 
Your Application may be distributed through bundling arrangements (referring to the distribution of your Application in a "bundle" that installs your Application with one or more other Applications). However, in such case, you may not access Google services from any such Application unless each of the following requirements is satisfied:
7.1. .
Bundling
 
 
 
 
7.2. .
PC OEM
 
 
 
 
7.3. . [*]
No Google Branding
When entering into any bundling arrangements, it is your responsibility to ensure that your direct and indirect distribution or bundling partners (and any applications included in any bundle with your Application to the extent required herein) comply with the applicable requirements of these Guidelines.
7.4. .
General
 
 
 
As mentioned above, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Exhibits, from time to time; provided, however, that no updates will be effective until Google provides you with [*] written notice thereof. Once you receive that notice, you will be required to bring your Application into compliance within [*].
10.1. .
General
. If, solely as a result of an updated requirement, one or more of your Applications no longer complies with these Guidelines, as updated, and you are incapable of bringing such Application into compliance prior to the scheduled effective date of such update (the ""), you agree to provide Google with written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than the Update Effective Date, identifying the Application and the reasons why it may not be brought into compliance prior to the Update Effective Date, and providing such other detail as Google may reasonably request with respect thereto (consistent in any event with your confidentiality obligations). Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within [*] of the Update Notice Date (the ""). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a requirement provided for in the update to these Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least [*] prior written notice, to cease providing services to either the specific non-conforming Application or to those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those Applications (or versions thereof) to which Google elects to cease providing services as provided herein.

Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On March 31, 2011, InfoSpace, Inc.'s subsidiary InfoSpace Sales LLC (collectively, "InfoSpace") entered into Amendment Number Seven to Amended and Restated Google Services Agreement (the "Seventh Amendment") with Google, Inc. ("Google"). The Seventh Amendment extends the Amended and Restated Google Services Agreement (as amended, the "Agreement") between InfoSpace and Google, under which InfoSpace displays search results and advertisements from Google on InfoSpace's owned and operated search websites and provides to the websites in its distribution network. Under the terms of the Agreement, Google pays InfoSpace a percentage of the revenue collected by Google as a result of Internet users clicking on advertisements provided by Google and displayed by InfoSpace and its distribution partners. The term of the Agreement is extended by the Seventh Amendment until March 31, 2013, and may be extended until March 31, 2014 at InfoSpace's sole discretion, provided that it has not assigned the Agreement to another party. The other material terms of the Seventh Amendment are as follows:
- The parties will test a new implementation of Google-provided advertisements on InfoSpace's owned and operated search websites and on the websites in its distribution network.
- On or before June 30, 2011, InfoSpace will notify Google whether it will adopt the new advertising implementation for the remainder of the term of the Agreement.
- There are two separate cost and payment structures under the Seventh Amendment; one that will apply if InfoSpace decides to use the new advertising implementation, and one that will apply if InfoSpace decides to revert to the previous advertisement implementation.
- The cost and payment terms are materially better for InfoSpace if it decides to use the new advertising implementation for the remainder of the term. InfoSpace expects, assuming current trends for traffic quality and click volume are maintained, that it will earn revenue under the payment structure for the new advertisement implementation that is similar to revenue that it earned under the terms of the Agreement as it existed prior to the Seventh Amendment. However, if InfoSpace decides to revert to the previous advertising implementation after the test period, the payment structure that would then be in effect contains terms that would be expected to result in materially reduced revenue for InfoSpace.
The remainder of the Seventh Amendment, which will be attached as an exhibit to the Company's next Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, consists of revisions to Google's requirements and guidelines, minor changes to the legal terms of the Agreement, and updates to reflect changes in the relationship since the Agreement was initially signed in 2005. These changes are not expected to materially affect the Company's operations or financial results.
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The impact of the changes to the operations of InfoSpace's search business caused by new and changed provisions in Amendment Seven are currently unknown. The forward-looking statements above are based on assumptions regarding matters that include, but are not limited to: the operational impact of these new and changed provisions, the continuation of current business trends, the ability of the Company to implement technology changes necessary to apply the revised requirements, future consistency in the manner in which Google applies its guidelines and otherwise does business with the Company, and the applicability of the results of limited tests to results for InfoSpace's entire search business. However, if those assumptions are incorrect, the new and changed provisions in Amendment Number Seven may have a material negative impact on the operations and financial results of InfoSpace. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Current Report. InfoSpace undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

BELLEVUE, Wash., March 31, 2011  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced it will continue distributing Google search results and advertising content through the InfoSpace network of Web search properties and partner websites, extending their longstanding partnership. The parties entered into a multi-year deal. This will benefit web users by enabling InfoSpace to continue providing comprehensive search results from all the leading search engines through its metasearch technology.
"This is an exciting time at InfoSpace and we are extremely proud to renew our relationship with Google. InfoSpace has compiled the best search results from the Web's largest search engines for more than 15 years. Our nearly decade long partnership with Google, along with the millions of users that search on our sites, illustrates the significance, strength, and relevance of metasearch today," said Bill Ruckelshaus, president and acting CEO of InfoSpace.
Under the terms of the agreement, InfoSpace products and users will continue to access world-class content and leading-edge development in search features. InfoSpace expects to maintain similar economic results to those realized under the previous contract with Google.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations due to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general economic, industry, and market sector conditions; the timing and extent of market acceptance of developed products and services and related costs; our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services; future acquisitions; and the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives, operating plans, and marketing strategies. In addition, the impact of the changes to the operations of InfoSpace's search business caused by new and changed provisions in Amendment Number Seven to Amended and Restated Google Services Agreement are unknown. InfoSpace's management believes, based on assumptions, limited tests, and current trends in the business, that the economic impact of these changes will be minimal, and may be positive, neutral, or negative. However, if those assumptions are incorrect, the business trends change, or Google were to change the way it does business with InfoSpace, the new and changed provisions in Amendment Number Seven may have a material negative impact on the operations and financial results of InfoSpace. These risks are not dissimilar to those associated with the
Company's previous partnership with Google. A more detailed description of these and certain other factors that could affect actual results is included in InfoSpace, Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. InfoSpace, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On April 11, 2011, InfoSpace, Inc.'s Board of Directors approved a new form of indemnification agreement (the "2011 Indemnification Agreement") to be entered into between the Company and (i) each member of the Board, (ii) each of the Company's current executive officers, and (iii) any other employees, as the Company's Board of Directors or Chief Executive Officer deem appropriate from time to time (each such executing individual, an "Indemnitee").
The 2011 Indemnification Agreement becomes effective for each Indemnitee upon execution and governs the indemnification rights and obligations of the Indemnitee and the Company with respect to Proceedings (as defined in the 2011 Indemnification Agreement) that arose or may arise from an Indemnifying Event (as defined in the 2011 Indemnification Agreement). To the extent that an Indemnitee has previously executed an indemnification agreement with the Company, that previous indemnification agreement will govern the indemnification rights and obligations of the Indemnitee and the Company with respect to Proceedings that arose or may arise from an Indemnifying Event that occurred before the effective date of the 2011 Indemnification Agreement.
Pursuant to the 2011 Indemnification Agreement, the Company is required to, among other things, indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law in the event that the Indemnitee is a party to, witness to, or otherwise involved in any legal matter that relates to the Indemnitee's status as a director, officer, or employee of the Company. That indemnification obligation includes reimbursing the Indemnitee for any Expenses (as defined in the 2011 Indemnification Agreement) incurred in such matters, payment of losses or settlement amounts, and may include advancement of amounts for Expenses. The indemnification obligation is limited by any determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under the 2011 Indemnification Agreement, federal law, or Delaware state law, and any advancement is subject to the requirement that the Indemnitee repay the advanced expenses if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee was not entitled to be indemnified. The 2011 Indemnification Agreement also limits the period of time in which the Company may bring a legal claim against the Indemnitee to three years from the date of accrual of such claim.
The foregoing description is a summary, does not purport to be a complete description of the 2011 Indemnification Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2011 Indemnification Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
 
 
Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

- 2 -
Company's indemnification obligation in this paragraph shall be applied to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company's articles of incorporation, by-laws, applicable law, or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change; to the extent that such change(s) would narrow the Indemnitee's rights or the Company's obligations hereunder, they will not limit or affect the scope of this Agreement; provided, however, that any changes required by applicable law to be applied to this Agreement shall be so applied regardless of whether the effect of such change is to narrow the Indemnitee's rights or the Company's obligations hereunder.
2.2. Initiation of Proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advancement pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee unless (a) the Company has joined in, or the Board has consented to, such Proceeding; or (b) the Proceeding is one to enforce indemnification rights under Section 5.
     
2.3. Expense Advances.
If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance any and all Expenses to Indemnitee (
"Expense Advances"
) within 20 calendar days after the receipt by the Company of a statement from Indemnitee requesting such Expense Advances, whether before or after final disposition of any Proceeding. Expense Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee's ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to Indemnitee's ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the provisions of this Agreement. The Indemnitee shall qualify for Expense Advances solely upon the execution and delivery to the Company of an undertaking
(in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company)
providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the Expense Advance if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. Expense Advances shall include any and all Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement. If Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, as provided in Section 4, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made
(as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or have lapsed)
. Indemnitee's obligation to reimburse the Company for Expense Advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon. For the sake of clarity, Expense Advances shall not be considered personal loans.
     
2.4. Mandatory and Partial Indemnification
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits in defense of any claim, issue, or matter in a Proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection with that claim, issue, or matter. If Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification by the Company for some, but not all, of the total amount paid or incurred by Indemnitee in the Proceeding or other legal action to which the Expenses relate, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee for the portion to which Indemnitee is entitled.
     
2.5. Primacy of Indemnification.
In the event that Indemnitee has rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, or liability insurance provided by a third party or affiliates of Indemnitee (collectively, the "
Outside Indemnitors
"), this section 2.5 shall govern the relationship between the indemnification provided by the Company and that provided by the Outside Indemnitors. The Company shall be the indemnitor of first resort, i.e., its obligations to the Indemnitee under this Agreement and any indemnity provisions set forth in its
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, or elsewhere (collectively, "
Indemnity Arrangements
") are primary, and any obligation of the Outside Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the Indemnitee is secondary and excess. The Company shall advance the full amount of expenses incurred by the Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, to the extent legally permitted and as required by any Indemnity Arrangement, without regard to any rights the Indemnitee may have against the Outside Indemnitors. The Company irrevocably waives, relinquishes, and releases the Outside Indemnitors from any claims against the Outside Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation, or any other recovery of any kind arising out of or relating to any Indemnity Arrangement. No advancement or indemnification payment by any Outside Indemnitor on behalf of the Indemnitee shall affect the foregoing, and the Outside Indemnitors shall be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee against the Company. The Company and the Indemnitee agree that the Outside Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 2.5. The Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its insurers to the extent allowed by the policies, waives subrogation rights against Indemnitee.
Directors of the Company acting by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum of the Board of Directors; (b) a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; or (c) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel.
     
3.2.
After a Change in Control, or if there are no Disinterested Directors, the Reviewing Party shall be the Independent Counsel. With respect to all matters arising from a Change in Control concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the Company's articles of incorporation or by-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from Independent Counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld)
, and who has not otherwise performed services for the Company or the Indemnitee
(other than in connection with indemnification matters)
within the last five years. The Independent Counsel shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement. Such counsel shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee should be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel.
shall receive payment thereof, from the Company in accordance with this Agreement within 30 calendar days after Indemnitee has made written demand on the Company for indemnification, unless the Reviewing Party has provided a written determination to the Company that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law. The Reviewing Party making the determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall notify Indemnitee of such written determination no later than two business days after providing such notice to Company. A demand for indemnification under this Agreement shall include such
- 4 -
documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.
     
4.2. Suit to Enforce Rights.
Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce its indemnification rights under this Agreement by commencing litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any determination by the Reviewing Party if:
     
Any determination by the Reviewing Party not challenged by the Indemnitee on or before the first anniversary of the date of the Reviewing Party's determination shall be binding on the Company and Indemnitee. The remedy provided for in this Section 4 shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Indemnitee in law or equity.
- 5 -
Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or action brought by Indemnitee for:
     
5.2.
If requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance such Expenses to Indemnitee on such terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.3.
Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company of that commencement; provided that the omission so to notify the Company will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to Indemnitee, except to the extent such failure to make notice has actually impaired the Company's ability to defend that Proceeding.
- 6 -
     
6.3. Settlement of Claims.
The Company shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written consent.

To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding, or any claim, issue, or matter in a Proceeding, and the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee for such Proceeding, claim, issue, or matter, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee
(whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement or for reasonably incurred Expenses in connection with such claim)
, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of the circumstances. The following factors shall be considered when determining the amount of such contribution: (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding, claim, issue or matter, and (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and their other directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) or transaction(s).

UBROGATION

In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: April 27, 2011
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., April 27, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
"InfoSpace delivered another strong quarter, as we exceeded our expectations in both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Our increased profitability was largely due to the strength of the search business," said Bill Ruckelshaus, President and Chief Executive Officer of InfoSpace. "We are pleased with the sequential performance and will continue to invest in intiatives that position us for long-term growth. In addition, we are firmly focused on strategic opportunities to leverage our cash position and significant tax asset to increase shareholder value."
First Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments
During the first quarter, InfoSpace continued to execute against its operational plans. Highlights include:
 
 
 
First Quarter Segment Information
Core
Core revenue was $51.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of $10.1 million or 16 percent from the first quarter of 2010.
Core income was $9.0 million for the first quarter of 2011, which represents an increase of $2.8 million or 44 percent from the first quarter of 2010.
E-Commerce
E-Commerce revenue was $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2010. E-Commerce loss was $1.9 million.
Second Quarter Outlook
For the second quarter of 2011, the Company expects revenues to be between $59 million and $62 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be between $6.5 million and $7.5 million, and net income to be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million, or $0.04 to $0.07 per diluted share.
Conference Call and Webcast
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific time / 5 p.m. Eastern time. The live webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate website, at .
http://www.infospaceinc.com
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("") to exclude the effects of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other loss (income), net (which includes such items as adjustments to the fair values of contingent liabilities related to business combinations, gains on resolutions of contingencies , interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
GAAP
InfoSpace's management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of its core business operating results. InfoSpace uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. InfoSpace believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which the Company's management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this release.
InfoSpace's Non-GAAP net income is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income to exclude the non-cash portion of income tax expense, as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited). Non-cash income tax expense represents a reduction to cash taxes payable associated with the utilization of deferred tax assets, which are primarily comprised of U.S. federal net operating losses. The Company's management believes that excluding the non-cash portion of income tax expense from its GAAP net income provides meaningful supplemental information to investors and analysts regarding the Company's performance and the valuation of its business because of its ability to offset a substantial portion of its cash tax liabilities by using these deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets will expire if unutilized in 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations due to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general economic, industry, and market sector conditions; the timing and extent of market acceptance of developed products and services and related costs; our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services; future acquisitions; the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives, operating plans, and marketing strategies; the condition of our cash investments; and the completion of the review of our financial statements for the first quarter of
2011. A more detailed description of these and certain other factors that could affect actual results is included in InfoSpace, Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On June 10, 2011, InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace") executed a definitive agreement (the "Agreement") to sell its Mercantila e-commerce business to Zoo Stores, Inc. ("Zoo Stores"). Under the terms of the Agreement, which is subject to certain closing conditions, Zoo Stores will acquire (the "Acquisition") 100% of the membership interests in Mercantila Acquisition LLC ("Mercantila"). As consideration for the Acquisition, Zoo Stores will pay InfoSpace a nominal upfront payment, plus the right to receive additional consideration up to $3,000,000, contingent on liquidity or other events.
InfoSpace's management no longer believes that the Mercantila business fits within InfoSpace's strategy as it moves forward. As a result, while the net loss from operating the Mercantila business continues to improve, InfoSpace's management believes this transaction is the best outcome for shareholder value. In the event that the Acquisition does not close, or the Agreement is otherwise terminated, InfoSpace will either seek to sell Mercantila to another buyer or will close Mercantila's operations.

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On June 22, 2011, InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace") completed the sale of its Mercantila e-commerce business to Zoo Stores, Inc. ("Zoo Stores"), pursuant to the terms of the LLC Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") executed by the parties on June 10, 2011. As a result of this transaction, Zoo Stores acquired 100% of the membership interests in Mercantila Acquisition LLC ("Mercantila"), the former InfoSpace subsidiary that owns and runs the Mercantila e-commerce business.
Nikhil Behl, who prior to the closing of the transaction was a Named Executive Officer of InfoSpace, owns a majority interest in Zoo Stores. Mr. Behl will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Mercantila and has ceased to be an officer of, or otherwise affiliated with, InfoSpace as of the closing of the transaction.
As consideration for the acquisition of Mercantila, Zoo Stores paid InfoSpace a nominal upfront payment and has a continuing obligation to pay up to $3,000,000 more, contingent on liquidity or other events. The nature and amount of this consideration was determined by InfoSpace after considering other options for the sale of all or some of Mercantila's assets and the potential costs associated with a shutdown of the business.
The foregoing description is a summary, does not purport to be a complete description of the Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On June 22, 2011, InfoSpace and Nikhil Behl, Chief Executive Officer of Mercantila, entered into a Termination and Waiver agreement that modifies Mr. Behl's employment agreement (a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by InfoSpace on August 4, 2010). The Termination and Waiver, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference, was executed in connection with the closing of the transaction described above, and clarifies that Mr. Behl's employment by InfoSpace terminated upon the closing of the transaction and that Mr. Behl will not be entitled to any separation benefits provided for in his employment agreement.
The foregoing description is a summary, does not purport to be a complete description of the Termination and Waiver, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Termination and Waiver, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet of InfoSpace as of March 31, 2011 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010 (collectively, the "Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements") are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2011 gives effect to the sale of the Company's interest in its Mercantila business to Zoo Stores and the discontinuation and exit of its e-commerce business as if the sale of the Company's interest in its Mercantila business and the discontinuation and exit of its e-commerce business had occurred on March

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., July 28, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
"We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter," said Bill Ruckelshaus, President and Chief Executive Officer of InfoSpace. " Our core search business continues to perform well and posted another quarter of sequential revenue growth, as well as growth from the second quarter of 2010. With the sale of our e-commerce business in June, our financial results highlight, to a greater extent, the profitability of the search business. Additionally, we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities to enhance long-term shareholder value."
As a result of the sale of our e-commerce business, the Company is presenting the financial results for the ongoing business as continuing operations, which exclude the results of the e-commerce business. The results of the e-commerce business are presented as discontinued operations. The Company is providing this view of its financial results for both the second quarter of 2011 as well as historic periods.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third Quarter Outlook
For the third quarter of 2011, the Company expects revenues to be between $55 million and $57 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be between $7.5 million and $8.5 million, and net income to be between $3 million and $4 million, or $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share.
Conference Call and Webcast
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific time / 5 p.m. Eastern time. The live webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate website, at .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("") to exclude the effects of discontinued operations (including loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes), of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other loss (income), net (which includes such items as adjustments to the fair values of contingent liabilities related to business combinations, gains on resolutions of contingencies, interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
GAAP
InfoSpace's management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of its core business operating results. InfoSpace uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. InfoSpace believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which the Company's management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this release.
InfoSpace's Non-GAAP net income is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income to exclude the effects of discontinued operations (including loss from discontinued operations , net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes)and non-cash income taxes from continuing operations, as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited). Non-cash income tax expense from continuing operations represents a reduction in cash taxes from continuing operations primarily attributable to the utilization of U.S. net operating losses. InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance.
Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations due to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general economic, industry, and market sector conditions; the timing and extent of market acceptance of developed products and services and related costs; our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services; future acquisitions; the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives, operating plans, and marketing strategies; the condition of our cash investments; and the completion of the review of our financial statements for the second quarter of 2011. A more detailed description of these and certain other factors that could affect actual results is included in InfoSpace, Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. InfoSpace, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
InfoSpace's Non-GAAP net income is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income to exclude the effects of discontinued operations (including loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes) and the non-cash portion of income tax expense from continuing operations. The non-cash portion of income tax expense from continuing operations represents a reduction to cash taxes payable associated with the utilization of deferred tax assets, which are primarily comprised of U.S. federal net operating losses. Due to the Company's continued ability to offset a substantial portion of its cash tax liabilities through 2020 provided by these deferred tax assets, management believes that excluding the non-cash portion of income tax expense from continuing operations and the effects of discontinued operations from its GAAP net income provides meaningful supplemental information to investors and analysts regarding the Company's performance and the valuation of its business.
Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income .

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 23, 2011, InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace") entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, a Stockholder Agreement, and a Warrant to Purchase Common Stock (collectively, the "Agreements") with Cambridge Information Group I LLC ("CIG"). In connection with the Agreements, Andrew M. Snyder, President of CIG, was elected to fill the existing vacancy on InfoSpace's Board of Directors.
Pursuant to the Agreements, on August 23, 2011, InfoSpace sold to CIG 764,192 newly-issued shares of unregistered InfoSpace common stock at a purchase price of $9.16 per share (equal to the average of the consolidated closing bid price of InfoSpace's common stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on August 19, 2011). The common stock purchased is subject to certain lockup provisions that prohibit sales of that common stock for specified time periods. In addition, InfoSpace issued to CIG warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase 1 million shares of InfoSpace common stock, exercisable at a price of $9.62 per share. The Warrants expire on August 23, 2014 unless InfoSpace has consummated an acquisition transaction or series of transactions with an aggregate value of at least $200 million, in which case the Warrants will expire upon the earlier of (i) August 23, 2017 and (ii) the effective date of a change of control of InfoSpace.
The InfoSpace board of directors (the "Board") elected CIG representative Andrew Snyder to the Board and InfoSpace has granted CIG the right to appoint a replacement director representative in the event that Mr. Snyder is unavailable to serve. CIG's right to appoint a director representative will expire upon the earlier of (i) such time as CIG no longer beneficially owns at least 1 million shares of InfoSpace common stock and (ii) August 23, 2017.
So long as Mr. Snyder or a replacement director representative of CIG is a member of the Board, InfoSpace will allow CIG to exceed the 5% limit on ownership of InfoSpace common stock, up to a maximum of 10%. The InfoSpace Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, limits purchasers to less than 5% of the outstanding shares of InfoSpace unless the Board has granted a request to purchase more. Under the terms of the Agreements, the Board has agreed to grant requests by CIG to purchase up to a maximum ownership level of 10% of InfoSpace's then-outstanding common stock, inclusive of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. This allowance is subject to certain limitations, and is otherwise subject to the requirements set forth in Section 4.3 of the InfoSpace Certificate of Incorporation. In addition, if CIG holds more than 5% of InfoSpace's outstanding stock at the time that a CIG director representative no longer sits on the Board, then the limitation in this allowance shall be frozen at the level of CIG's then-current holdings.
The foregoing description of the Agreements is a summary, does not purport to be a complete description of the Agreements, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreements, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The disclosure set forth above under Item 1.01 is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02. The common stock and Warrants described in Item 1.01 above were issued in reliance upon a exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. CIG is acquiring these securities for its own account and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D. At the time of their issuance, these securities will be deemed to be restricted securities for purposes of the Securities Act and the certificates representing the securities shall bear legends to that effect.
 
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Under the terms of the Agreements, the Board elected Andrew Snyder as a director, effective on August 23, 2011. Mr. Snyder is President of CIG and Chairman of CIG's subsidiaries, ProQuest LLC, R. R. Bowker LLC, and Navtech, Inc. Mr. Snyder also served on the Board of Directors of Navtech when it was an independent, publicly-held company, beginning in November 2005 and continuing through its merger with a CIG subsidiary in November 2007. Mr. Snyder has been employed by CIG since 2003 and has served as President since 2004. Prior to joining CIG, Mr. Snyder worked for the Goldman Sachs Group, most recently as Vice President in the Principal Investment Area, where he focused on traditional media, technology, and services investing for the firm's investment fund. Mr. Snyder is a graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and the Georgetown University Law Center. He currently serves on the Board of The Association of American Publishers, the Board of Overseers of Penn Libraries, and the New Leaders Steering Committee of the New York Presbyterian Hospital. The InfoSpace board of directors has agreed to appoint Mr. Snyder to serve as Chair of a Mergers and Acquisitions Committee, to be created by the board within three months of the closing date of the Agreements.
Mr. Snyder will be compensated for his service as a director under the terms of the Amended and Restated Equity Grant Program for Nonemployee Directors and the Nonemployee Director Cash Compensation Policy, copies of which were attached as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by InfoSpace on April 13, 2011. Under these plans, Mr. Snyder will be paid a quarterly cash retainer for Board and committee services, will be paid for each meeting attended in excess of a specified number, and will receive initial and ongoing annual grants of restricted stock units and stock options.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On August 23, 2011, InfoSpace issued a press release announcing the Agreements with CIG described above and the election of Andrew Snyder to the Board. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Below Market Options is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Below Market Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the exercise of all such Below Market Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Below Market Options, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such Below Market Options (assuming full conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities, if applicable).

If, in any case, the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any Options or upon conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities is not, in fact, issued and the rights to exercise such Option or to convert or exchange such Convertible Securities shall have expired or terminated, the Warrant Price then in effect will be readjusted to the Warrant Price which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such Options or Convertible Securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination (other than in respect of the actual number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof), never been issued.
Treatment of Expired Options and Unexercised Convertible Securities
(v) . If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued, granted or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor for purposes of this Warrant will be the amount received by the Company therefor, before deduction of reasonable commissions, underwriting discounts or allowances or other reasonable expenses paid or incurred by the Company in connection with such issuance, grant or sale. In case any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration part or all of which shall be other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair market value of such consideration as determined in the good faith reasonable business judgment of the Board of Directors.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BELLEVUE, Wash., October 27, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011.
"InfoSpace had a great third quarter," said Bill Ruckelshaus, President and Chief Executive Officer of InfoSpace. "We continue to execute on our business goals while also generating consistent cash flow from operations. We are pleased with revenue growth, both when compared to the prior quarter and the prior year. Additionally, we remain focused on acquisition opportunities to enhance long-term value for InfoSpace shareholders."
 
 
 
 
 
Fourth Quarter Outlook
For the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company expects revenues to be between $58 million and $61 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be between $7.5 million and $8.5 million, and net income to be between $3.5 million and $4.5 million, or $0.09 to $0.11 per diluted share.
Other Developments
The Company has been informed by its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") conducted an inspection of the audit that Deloitte & Touche LLP performed relating to the Company's financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. Deloitte & Touche has also informed the Company that in connection with this inspection the PCAOB has raised certain questions regarding the Company's accounting treatment of goodwill of $12.7 million relating to its acquisition of Make the Web Better in the second quarter of 2010. As a result, the Company is currently evaluating these questions and considering whether any change to the Company's
accounting for this transaction would be necessary. If the Company were to determine that a change in the accounting for this transaction is necessary, the Company expects to be required to restate its financial statements for the second quarter of 2010 and all subsequent periods, including its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010. Any change in the accounting would likely result in a non-cash charge, and the resulting restatement would not affect the Company's previously reported revenue or Adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes that any such restatement would primarily impact 2010, and that it would not have a material effect on the quarter ended September 30, 2011.
Conference Call and Webcast
A conference call will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific time / 5 p.m. Eastern time. The live webcast can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the InfoSpace corporate website, at .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (") to exclude the effects of discontinued operations (including loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes),of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other loss, net (which includes such items as adjustments to the fair values of contingent liabilities related to business combinations, gains on resolutions of contingencies, interest income, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
"GAAP
InfoSpace's management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of its core business operating results. InfoSpace uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. InfoSpace believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which the Company's management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this release.
InfoSpace's Non-GAAP net income is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income to exclude the effects of discontinued operations (including loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes) and non-cash income taxes from continuing operations, as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited). Non-cash income tax expense from continuing operations represents a reduction in cash taxes from continuing operations primarily attributable to the utilization of U.S. net operating losses. InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance.
Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income.

The non-cash portion of income tax expense from continuing operations represents a reduction to cash taxes payable associated with the utilization of deferred tax assets, which are primarily comprised of U.S. federal net operating losses. Due to the Company's continued ability to offset a substantial portion of its cash tax liabilities through 2020 provided by these deferred tax assets, management believes that excluding the non-cash portion of income tax expense from continuing operations and the effects of discontinued operations from its GAAP net income provides meaningful supplemental information to investors and analysts regarding the Company's performance and the valuation of its business.
Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income .

Item 4.02.    Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
 
(a) As reported by InfoSpace, Inc. (the "Company") in its Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on October 27, 2011, the Company has been in discussion with its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, regarding the Company's accounting treatment of goodwill of $12.7 million relating to its April 2010 acquisition of the Make the Web Better assets. On October 30, 2011, the Company's management, after consultation with members of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and Deloitte & Touche LLP, concluded that the Company's accounting treatment of that goodwill was in error, and because of that error, investors should no longer rely upon the following (in each case relating only to second quarter of 2010 and all subsequent periods): (a) the consolidated financial statements and the related audit report of its independent registered public accounting firm included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010; (b) the condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011, September 30, 2010, and June 30, 2010; or (c) the financial results disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on October 27, 2011.
On April 1, 2010, the Company purchased assets consisting of internet properties and licenses for content and technology from Make The Web Better, a developer of online products used on social networking sites and a member of the Company's search distribution network. The Company purchased these assets for $13.0 million, and allocated $12.7 million of the purchase price to goodwill. The Company has determined that $12.7 million should have been allocated to an intangible asset consisting of an installed code base that directs Make The Web Better users to use the Company's search services. As a result of this determination, the Company is allocating the $12.7 million initially classified as goodwill to the installed code base, and is amortizing that intangible asset ratably as a proportion of the estimated revenue generated by the installed code base, as adjusted by changes in the estimated total revenue expected to be generated. This amortization will be recorded as an expense to cost of sales. The impact of this amortization to cost of sales for fiscal 2010 is approximately $4.3 million in the second quarter, $3.0 million in the third quarter, and $1.7 million in the fourth quarter, for a total impact of approximately $9.0 million in fiscal 2010. The impact of this amortization for periods reported in fiscal 2011 is approximately $1.0 million in the first quarter, $0.8 million in the second quarter, and $0.5 million in the third quarter, for a total of approximately $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
Amortization of installed code base allocated to cost of sales is a non-cash expense, and the correction of this error will have no impact on previously disclosed revenues or cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, the correction will have no effect on Adjusted EBITDA, as the amortization of intangible assets expense is specifically excluded from the Company's computation of Adjusted EBITDA. The impact to net income will be net of related income taxes for each period presented.
The Company expects to file restatements for all periods, beginning with the second quarter of 2010, in an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for fiscal 2010 and in amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the first and second quarters of 2011. The Company intends to file these amended periodic reports, as well as its third quarter Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q no later than November 14, 2011, the expiration date of the extension period provided by Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. However, there can be no assurance that these filings will be made within this period.
The Company's management has discussed the matters disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K with Deloitte & Touche LLP.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release, and which may differ significantly from actual results due to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general economic, industry, and market sector conditions; the timing and extent of market acceptance of developed products and services and related costs; the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives, business integration plans, operating plans, and marketing strategies. A more detailed description of these and certain other factors that could affect actual results is included in InfoSpace, Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. InfoSpace, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
 
 
 
InfoSpace's and TaxACT's Pro forma non-GAAP net incomes are calculated by adjusting Pro forma GAAP net income, less pro forma interest imputed on the debt incurred related to the acquisition of TaxACT's operations and pro forma income tax expense, to exclude the effects of discontinued operations (including loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes) and the non-cash portion of income tax expense from pro forma continuing operations. The non-cash portion of income tax expense from pro forma continuing operations represents a reduction to cash taxes payable associated with the utilization of deferred tax assets, which are primarily comprised of U.S. federal net operating losses. Due to the Company's continued ability to offset a substantial portion of its cash tax liabilities through 2020 provided by these deferred tax assets, management believes that excluding the non-cash portion of income tax expense from pro forma continuing operations and the effects of discontinued operations from its Pro forma GAAP net income provides meaningful supplemental information to financial statement users regarding the Company's performance and the valuation of its business. Accordingly, InfoSpace also believes that the presented Pro forma non-GAAP net income is meaningful information for financial statement users.
Pro forma adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma non-GAAP net income should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income.
These non-GAAP financial measures presented, both Pro forma adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma non-GAAP net income, for the combined entities InfoSpace and TaxACT, do not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have existed had InfoSpace operated those organizations as a combined business.

InfoSpace purchased the TaxACT business for consideration of $287.5 million in cash, less certain transaction expenses, and subject to certain specified working capital adjustments. The Acquisition was funded from InfoSpace's cash reserves, from the proceeds of the sale of certain short term investments held by InfoSpace, and from the net proceeds of a $105 million credit facility (of which $100 million was drawn). 2nd Story is the primary debtor for this credit facility and the repayment obligations will be paid out of cash generated by the TaxACT business. Specific details of this credit facility, which closed concurrently with the closing of the Merger Agreement, and the terms of the related credit agreement, will be contained in a subsequent Current Report on Form 8-K. Prior to the Acquisition, there was no material relationship between InfoSpace (or any InfoSpace affiliated person or party) and 2nd Story Software, Inc., 2SS Holdings, Inc.

Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 31, 2012, 2nd Story Software, Inc. ("2nd Story") and TaxACT Holdings, Inc. ("TaxACT Holdings") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") and ancillary agreements and documents (collectively, with the Credit Agreement, the "Credit Facility") with RBS Citizens, N.A., as administrative agent and a lender ("RBS"), BMO Harris Financing, Inc., Silicon Valley Bank, Bank of America, N.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (collectively, with RBS, the "Lenders"). TaxACT Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of InfoSpace, Inc. (the "Company"), and 2nd Story is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TaxACT Holdings. As described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on January 31, 2012, the Credit Facility was entered into in connection with, and closed concurrent with, the closing of the merger in which the Company acquired TaxACT Holdings and 2nd Story. TaxACT Holdings executed the Credit Agreement solely as a guarantor and granted a security interest in 100% of the outstanding equity in 2nd Story as collateral for the Credit Facility. The Company is not a party to the Credit Agreement, and has not guaranteed any of the obligations of its subsidiaries under the Credit Facility.
Under the terms of the Credit Facility, 2nd Story borrowed $95,000,000 from the Lenders in the form of a term loan (the "Term Loan") and drew $5,000,000 from a $10,000,000 revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") with the Lenders. The final maturity date of both the Term Loan and the Revolver is January 31, 2017.
The Term Loan will amortize in equal quarterly installments (beginning with the 2nd Story fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2012) based on the annual amortization percentages of the original principal amount of $95,000,000, as set forth below:
- Year One: 10%
- Year Two: 10%
- Year Three: 10%
- Year Four: 15%
- Year Five: 15%
The remainder of the Term Loan principal, if any, will be due on the maturity date of January 31, 2017.
As set forth in more detail in the Credit Agreement, 2nd Story will make mandatory prepayments on the Term Loan in the event of certain specified receipts, including any 2nd Story Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement). 2nd Story may also prepay amounts under the Term Loan without penalty, subject to certain specified restrictions and costs.
2nd Story will pay a rate of interest, at its option, of either (i) LIBOR plus a margin of between 3% and 4.5% (depending on 2nd Story's ratio of leverage to EBITDA over the previous four quarters), or (ii) a specified variable rate plus a margin of between 2% and 3.5% (depending on 2nd Story's ratio of leverage to EBITDA over the previous four quarters). In addition, 2nd Story paid the Lenders and RBS certain customary fees and costs.
The Credit Agreement contains the following customary terms and conditions that are applicable to TaxACT Holdings and 2nd Story (but not the Company): (i) representations and warranties, including but not limited to, (a) financial condition, (b) absence of any material adverse effect, and (c) organizational and legal status and authority; (ii) affirmative covenants, including but not limited to, (a) financial and collateral reporting, (b) payment of taxes and other obligations, (c) continuation of business and maintenance of existence and rights, and (d) maintenance of property and insurance; (iii) negative covenants, including but not limited to, (a) limitation on debt, (b) limitation on liens, (c) limitation on changes in nature of business, (d) limitation on consolidation, merger, sale, or purchase of assets, and (e) limitation on advances, investments, and loans; and (iv) specified financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also contains events of default consistent with those customarily found in similar financings, including but not limited to, (i) non-payment of obligations, (ii) inaccuracy of representations or warranties, (iii) non-performance of covenants and obligations, (iv) default on other material debt, (v) termination or default under material contracts, or (vi) bankruptcy or insolvency.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement and the Credit Facility is a summary, does not purport to be a complete description of the Credit Agreement or the Credit Facility, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for its quarter ending March 31, 2012.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
(b)
On February 8, 2012, Travis McElfresh and InfoSpace, Inc. agreed that Mr. McElfresh will no longer be employed as the Chief Technology Officer of InfoSpace, effective March 23, 2012. In connection with his departure, Mr. McElfresh will be treated in a manner consistent with the terms set forth in Section 6(b) of his Employment Agreement dated September 20, 2010 (a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2011), provided that the conditions set forth therein, including the execution of a release of claims, are satisfied.
(e)
On February 9, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the InfoSpace Board of Directors approved the 2012 Executive Bonus Plan. This plan provides for annual performance-based cash bonuses to the Company's executive officers. The target bonus amount for individual executive officers varies, and is between 50% and 100% of each executive's base salary.
The available bonus for each executive is based on a combination of (a) the Company's achievement of certain specified financial performance measures and (b) the individual performance of each executive and the discretion of the CEO (or, in the case of CEO bonus, the discretion of the Compensation Committee). For the Company financial performance measures, the specific measures vary by executive, but may include Company Revenue (as defined in the plan), Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the plan), and/or Adjusted Search EBIDTA (as defined in the plan). 70% of the bonus payout is based on the Company financial performance measures and 30% is based on the individual performance/discretionary element.
The performance targets established for this bonus plan correspond to the operating plan targets approved by the InfoSpace Board of Directors. Available bonuses range from zero to 150% of the target bonus for each component.
The foregoing description of the 2012 Executive Bonus Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of this plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: February 10, 2012
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
This plan document outlines the InfoSpace Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan") for calendar year 2012.
PLAN OBJECTIVES
 
 
 
 
EFFECTIVE DATE
The Plan was adopted by the Compensation Committee on February 9, 2012, and is effective for calendar year 2012. It amends and restates in its entirety the prior Executive Bonus Plan. The Plan may be changed at any time at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
PARTICIPATION ELIGIBILITY, BONUS TARGETS AND PAYOUT TIMING
The positions eligible for participation in the Plan are listed in the table below. Each participant's annual bonus target, which is stated as a percentage of annual base salary, is also set forth in the table below. If the executive leadership team changes composition, any additions to the Plan will be recommended by the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee.
1
Payment of bonuses awarded under this Plan will be made annually, following the conclusion of the calendar year.
 
 
PLAN DESIGN
The Plan includes financial performance components and a component that is based on individual objectives and the CEO's (or, with respect to the CEO, the Compensation Committee's) subjective evaluation of that individual's performance. The financial performance components collectively represent 70% of the bonus target, and the objectives/discretionary component represents 30% of the bonus target. The financial performance components for each plan participant include revenue and adjusted EBITA, although the specific adjusted EBITDA target differs among plan participants as noted in the table below.
Each bonus component, including each financial performance component and the objectives/discretionary component, may be achieved at a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. The Executive Bonus Payment Scale set forth below is applicable to determine the achievement of financial performance components. The achievement of the objectives/discretionary component may be achieved at the rate of 0% to 150%, with such level of achievement being subjectively determined by the CEO (or, with respect to the CEO, by the Compensation Committee).
 
Financial Targets
The financial measures used to determine the bonus achievement are defined as follows:
 
 
 
The financial targets at 100% match the corresponding operating plan targets approved by the Board of Directors in December 2011, which did not include an operating plan for the TaxACT business. In the discretion of the Compensation Committee, financial performance targets may be adjusted to incorporate TaxACT or any future transaction.
Bonus Scale
The Executive Bonus Payment Scale below will be used to calculate the available amounts to be paid to executives based on the financial performance objectives
 
 
 
 
 
EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
In order to be eligible for a bonus payment under the Plan, and for a bonus to be considered earned under the Plan, participants must be employed at the end of the fiscal year; provided, however, that if a participant's employment is terminated during the year "without Cause" or by the participant for "Good Reason" or due to "Constructive Termination" as such terms are defined in the applicable participant's employment agreement, then the participant will be entitled to accrued bonus as of the date of his or her termination. Accrued bonus will be calculated as (a) pro-rata achievement of financial performance components based on the then-current annual forecast and (b) pro-rata achievement of the objectives/discretionary component at the level communicated at the conclusion of the semi-annual measurement period, or with respect to any measurement period which has not yet been completed and communicated, achievement of the objectives/discretionary component at the level subjectively determined by the CEO (or, with respect to the CEO, the Compensation Committee).
APPROVAL
All bonus payments made to executives will be submitted to the Compensation Committee for final approval. The Compensation Committee may adjust the final bonus amount as it deems appropriate. The Committee has complete discretion to adjust bonus awards to reflect changes in the industry, company, the executive's job duties or performance, or any other circumstance the Committee determines should impact bonus awards.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
BELLEVUE, Wash., February 15, 2012 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011.
 
 
 
 
"InfoSpace delivered solid growth and profitability in 2011, including a strong fourth quarter," said Bill Ruckelshaus, President and Chief Executive Officer of InfoSpace. "The period since January 2011 has been an important time for our Company. In 2011, we solidified our position as a leading provider of distributed search solutions, adding more than 40 new distribution partners, and renewed our supplier agreements with Google and Yahoo!. Last month we announced our acquisition of TaxACT and thus entered the growing market for online tax preparation solutions. We approach the coming year with strong operating momentum in our search business and we are excited about the significant opportunity for TaxACT to expand their market presence and build upon their offerings."
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Highlights
 
 
 
 
First Quarter Outlook
As previously announced, the Company completed its acquisition of TaxACT on January 31, 2012. The Company's first quarter guidance includes anticipated results for TaxACT beginning on February 1, 2012 through March 31, 2012.
For the first quarter of 2012, the Company expects revenues to be between $109 million and $114 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be between $26 million and $29 million, and net income to be between $9.5 million and $11.5 million, or $0.24 to $0.29 per diluted share.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
InfoSpace's Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("") to exclude the effects of discontinued operations (including loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes), of income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other loss (income), net (which
GAAP
includes such items as litigation settlements, adjustments to the fair values of contingent liabilities related to business combinations, gains on resolutions of contingencies, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains or losses, and gains or losses from the disposal of assets), as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
InfoSpace's management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of its core business operating results. InfoSpace uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. InfoSpace believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate its performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting the Company's business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling the Company's Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which the Company's management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, accompanies the preliminary condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this release.
Non-GAAP net income is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income to exclude the effects of discontinued operations (including loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes) and non-cash income taxes from continuing operations, as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited). Non-cash income tax expense from continuing operations represents a reduction in cash taxes from continuing operations primarily attributable to the utilization of U.S. net operating losses. InfoSpace's management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance.
Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations due to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general economic, industry, and market sector conditions; the timing and extent of market acceptance of developed products and services and related costs; our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services; future acquisitions; the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives, operating plans, and marketing strategies; the condition of our cash investments; and the completion of the audit of our financial statements for 2011. A more detailed description of these and certain other factors that could affect actual results is included in InfoSpace, Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure
 
James Voelker, a member of the board of directors of InfoSpace, Inc. (the "Company") who also served as the Company's Chief Executive Officer from December 2002 to February 2009, has informed the Company that he intends to adopt a written sales plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Rule 10b5-1"). Mr. Voelker's 10b5-1 plan is intended to permit the orderly disposition of shares he will acquire upon the exercise of stock options that were granted in July and December 2002, which by their terms will expire in July and December 2012. An aggregate of 605,500 shares of the Company's common stock are subject to these stock options. Mr. Voelker intends to exercise and sell a portion of these shares during the open trading window that begins on February 21, with the balance to be exercised and sold pursuant to the 10b5-1 plan throughout the remainder of 2012 and prior to the expiration date of the applicable option. Sales under the plan will begin no sooner than 30 days after the plan's adoption, and are subject to certain minimum price levels.
Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material non-public information. Under these plans, insiders can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact and can avoid concerns about having material, non-public information when they purchase or sell stock. Once established, the insider has no discretion over transactions under a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Stock transactions pursuant to the terms of the plan will be disclosed publicly as required through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 4.01.    Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
 
On March 9, 2012, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors ("Audit Committee") of InfoSpace, Inc. ("Company") approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm for the Company's 2012 fiscal year, subject to the completion of final acceptance procedures. On March 14, 2012, this process was completed and the Company engaged Ernst & Young.
The Company dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as its independent registered public accounting firm on March 9, 2012. The decision to change auditors was the result of a competitive request for proposal process conducted by the Audit Committee in which Deloitte participated.
The reports of Deloitte on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, with the exception of Deloitte's report on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, which included an explanatory paragraph regarding the acquisition of TaxACT Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary, and Deloitte's report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, which expressed an adverse opinion due to the existence of a material weakness.
During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and through the filing date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, (i) there were no disagreements with Deloitte on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years or any subsequent interim period through the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except for the material weakness as of December 31, 2010.
During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and through the filing date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf consulted with Ernst & Young with respect to (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements, or (ii) any other matters or reportable events of the nature described in Items 304(a)(1)(iv) and (v) of Regulation S-K.
The Company has provided Deloitte with a copy of the disclosures in this Current Report on Form 8-K and requested that Deloitte furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements made by the Company in response to Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K. A copy of the letter, dated March 14, 2012, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On January 31, 2012, InfoSpace, Inc. ("InfoSpace" or "the Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K under item 2.01 to report that it had completed the acquisition of the TaxACT business, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger described in, and filed with, the Form 8-K filed by InfoSpace on January 9, 2012. As a result of this acquisition, InfoSpace now owns 100% of TaxACT Holdings, Inc., which owns 100% of 2nd Story Software, Inc. ("2nd Story"), the operating company for the TaxACT business and the holder of all rights and assets of the TaxACT business. The predecessor entity to TaxACT Holdings, Inc. was 2SS Holdings, Inc., under which the TaxACT business operated prior to its acquisition by InfoSpace, and for which historical and pro forma financial information is presented in this Amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A. In that Form 8-K, InfoSpace stated that it would file the required financial information by amendment, and this Form 8-K/A is being filed to provide that financial information.
 
(a) Financial statements of businesses acquired.
The required financial statements for 2SS Holdings, Inc., for the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 and for the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and are incorporated by reference herein.
(b) Pro forma financial information.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company consist of the Company's historical consolidated statements of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2011, to give effect to the acquisition of 2SS Holdings, Inc. by the Company (collectively, the "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements") on January 31, 2012. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of continuing operations are presented as if the acquisition of 2SS Holdings, Inc. by the Company occurred on January 1, 2010 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet is presented as if the acquisition of 2SS Holdings, Inc. by the Company occurred on September 30, 2011. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to reflect the results of operations that would have existed or occurred had such transaction taken place on the dates indicated, nor do they purport to reflect the financial condition or results of operations that will exist or occur in the future. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the period ended September 30, 2011, Amendment No. 1 to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A as of and for the period ended June 30, 2011, Amendment No. 2 to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A as of and for the period ended March 31, 2011, and in Amendment No. 1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2010, and 2SS Holdings, Inc.'s historical unaudited consolidated financial statements for the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 and its audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 and the notes thereto, included in Exhibit 99.2 of this Form 8-K/A.
Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of 2SS Holdings, Inc. in exchange for cash of $287.5 million, plus estimated transaction fees of approximately $1.3 million and debt origination costs of $3.3 million. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements present the acquisition of 2SS Holdings, Inc. under the acquisition method of accounting, which reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the time of the merger. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the preliminary purchase price allocation based on the Company's best estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to finalization of the valuation of intangible assets, other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including tax-related assets and liabilities. The Company does not anticipate the final purchase price allocation to be materially different.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements consist of the historical statements of continuing operations and balance sheet of InfoSpace, Inc. ("the Company") and 2SS Holdings, Inc. ("2SS Holdings") as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, with adjustments to reflect the acquisition of 2SS Holdings by the Company, as described herein:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's preliminary estimates of the economic lives of the acquired intangible assets are eight years for the customer relationships, four years for the proprietary technology, approximately three years for the personal property assets, and the trade name is estimated to have an indefinite-life. The Company plans to amortize the definite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated lives. The pro forma adjustments include the amortization of the intangible assets over their respective useful lives, stock-based compensation expense for equity awards granted to 2SS Holdings's employees upon acquisition, estimated interest expense related to the credit facility used to help fund the acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair values of the net assets acquired and the identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks are considered intangible assets with indefinite lives and will be tested for impairment at least annually, with the Company's other indefinite lived assets.
For purposes of this pro forma information, the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent has been used for all periods presented. This rate is an estimate and does not take into account any possible future tax events that may result for the ongoing combined company. Had the result of 2SS Holdings's operations been included in the Company's U.S. federal consolidated return for the periods presented, the Company would have been able to offset 2SS Holdings's U.S taxable income against the Company's net operating loss carryforwards.
 
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 23.1
We have issued our report dated August 4, 2011 (except for note K, as to which the date is January 31, 2012), with respect to the consolidated financial statements of 2SS Holdings, Inc. as of April 30, 2011 and 2010 and for the three year period ended April 30, 2011. We hereby consent to the incorporation by reference of said report in the Registration Statements of InfoSpace, Inc. on Forms S-8 (File No. 333-69165, effective on December 18, 1998; File No. 333-81593, effective June 25, 1999; File No. 333-42340, effective July 27, 2000; File No. 333-58420, effective April 6, 2001; File No. 333-116641, effective June 18, 2004; File No. 333-139284, effective December 12, 2006; File No. 333-58422, effective January 29, 2009; File No. 333-169691, effective September 30, 2010).
/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP
Appleton, Wisconsin
April 16, 2012

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2SS Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary (collectively, the "Company") develops and markets personal and business tax preparation computer software and electronic filing services throughout the United States, primarily to private individuals and companies through the Internet under the TaxACT brand, located at www.taxact.com.
 
A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows.
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 2SS Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, 2nd Story Software, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and changes therein, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
A majority of the Company's accounts receivable are due from financial institutions. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of an enterprise's financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts outstanding greater than 90 days are generally deemed past due and uncollectible and are charged against an allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not accrued on past due accounts. The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts, if any, represents an estimate of potential accounts receivable write-offs associated with recognized revenue based on historical trends and factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers. At September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary to cover estimated credit losses.
 
Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The Company recorded depreciation expense of $276,000 and $322,000 for the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
The Company has assessed whether there remains any income tax exposure related to its tax positions as of April 30, 2011 and 2010. The Company does not believe there is any uncertainty with respect to its tax positions which would result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements.
If applicable, the Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as additional income tax expense. For the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company has recorded no expense for interest and penalties.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in the state of Iowa. As of September 30, 2011, tax years open to examination by tax authorities under the statutes of limitations include years ended December 31, 2008 through 2010 for the Internal Revenue Service and for the Iowa Department of Revenue. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply.
 
For the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded immaterial product revenue, and product revenue is not separately presented in the statements of earnings, but is combined with services revenue and presented as one amount.
Software Products
Revenue on shrink-wrapped software products or down-loaded versions of the software are typically recognized upon shipment or down-load, which is when title passes and risk transfers, provided that collection is reasonably assured and there are no significant remaining obligations. The Company does not offer customers the right to return products. If advance payments are received from customers, revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred until the products are shipped or down-loaded.
Services
The Company offers an electronic preparation and filing service which allows customers to complete and submit their tax returns to the appropriate tax authority over the Internet. The Company offers this service to individuals, businesses and tax preparers. Customers may obtain and use one of three versions of the service depending primarily upon the complexity of the customer's tax filings. Revenue for this service is recognized at the time the tax return is filed.
In connection with the service, the Company offers email support free of charge to all customers, and with the sales of certain products, the Company also provides phone support for the use of the product, including both technical and tax preparation assistance. Customers using the professional version of the software must pay a separate one-time fee to receive support via phone. The Company does not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with the sales of these services, since the support is provided within the fiscal year and generally within 60 days after the associated revenue is recognized and is not material to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company also offers a data archive service to its customers. This service provides customers with access to their tax return information from the time of purchase through the third anniversary of the original filing deadline of the related return. Revenue for this hosting service is recognized ratably over this time period. Data archive fee amounts collected from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met.
 
Bank Products
The Company offers customers the opportunity to make their tax payments or to receive their tax refunds through products offered by certain financial institutions. The Company receives a fee from the financial institutions per transaction and, for one of the banks, based on the volume of financial products sold to the Company's customers. Such fees are recognized as revenue when the related financial products are sold to the end customer.
Revenue Arrangements That Include Multiple Elements
Revenue for transactions that include both service elements (i.e. electronic preparation and filing, and data archive service) is allocated to each element based on vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of the fair value and is recognized for each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element. VSOE is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. The Company recognizes revenue for the electronic preparation and filing service only when all of the following criteria are satisfied: when the undelivered element, data archive service, is not essential to the functionality of delivered element, the tax return has been filed, and the fair value for the undelivered element is known. Revenue related to the data archive service is recognized ratably over the three year period beginning from the original filing deadline date.
 
The Company presents all non-income government-assessed taxes (sales, use and value added taxes) collected from its customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis (excluded from revenue) in its financial statements.
 
Shipping and handling costs resulting from sales of software products are expensed as incurred and included as a component of cost of sales and services in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
 
Cost of revenue include the costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries through websites and other electronic means, providing customer assistance by telephone, shipping and handling of products, research and development, credit card fees and royalties. Many of these costs are not directly attributable to a product or service and thus have been allocated based on various judgmental factors.
 
The Company's advertising consists mainly of newspaper, television, radio and Internet ads and is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $307,000 and $234,000 for the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
Software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, the Company's software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, no development costs have been capitalized. Costs incurred by the Company in connection with the enhancement of existing products, or after the general release of the services using the product, are expensed in the current period and included as a component of research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
 
All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of earnings over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
 
Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance clarifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (that is, an exit price). The exit price is based on the amount that the holder of the asset or liability would receive or need to pay in an actual transaction (or in a hypothetical transaction if an actual transaction does not exist) at the measurement date.
 
Fair value is generally determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company uses valuation techniques that place greater reliance on observable inputs and less reliance on unobservable inputs. In measuring fair value, the Company may make adjustments for risks and uncertainties, if a market participant would include such an adjustment in its pricing.
 
The Company has entered into an agreement with Cedar Rapids Bank and Trust Company for a revolving line of credit allowing for maximum borrowings of $3,000,000. Borrowings, if any, are collateralized by all assets owned and hereafter acquired by the Company. Interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly at the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the prime rate less 0.5% (effective rate of 5% at April 30, 2011). There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at September 30, 2010. The agreement was renewed effective September 29, 2011, and requires that the Company maintain certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth. As of September 30, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. See Note K for further information on the line of credit, which was terminated on January 26, 2012.
 
The Company leases office space under an agreement accounted for as an operating lease. The lease requires monthly payments of $30,800 plus all taxes, utilities and maintenance. The agreement expires on August 31, 2013, at which point the Company has the option to renew the lease for an additional two-year term with monthly rental payments increasing to $33,800.
Effective June 1, 2008, as amended, the Company subleases a portion of this office space under an agreement which requires the sublessor to make minimum monthly payments of $7,300 through May 2011. In May 2011, this agreement was extended with the same terms through May 2012. The amended agreement provides for a one year renewal term upon written notice. Sublease rental income received in connection with this agreement is recorded as an offset to rent expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.
Future minimum rental payments and collections required under these leases are as follows for the years ended April 30:
 
Total rent expense for each of the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 was $118,000, net of sublease rental income of $36,000.
 
The Company has entered into agreements with various developers of software products which require the Company to make royalty payments based on the number of items used, subject to a minimum annual cost.
Total royalty expense under these agreements for the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 was $25,000 and $27,000, respectively.
 
No options were granted, cancelled, expired, exercised, or forfeited for the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. The expense is being allocated using the straight-line method over the vesting period. The Company recorded compensation expense of $9,000 and $33,000 for awards granted under the Plan for the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
 
The Company guarantees the accuracy of the calculations in the Standard and Deluxe Editions of its TaxACT software. If the Internal Revenue Service assesses a penalty to a consumer due to a calculation error on the consumer's tax return as generated by the software, the Company will reimburse the consumer for the amount of the penalty plus any interest charges resulting from the error. This remedy is limited to the consumer's personal return and does not apply if a consumer uses TaxACT to prepare returns for other individuals or entities. This guarantee is voided if the consumer overrides the software calculations within the tax return. Consumers must submit reimbursement claims within 60 days of receiving notice of the error.
Through September 30, 2011, the Company has not experienced any material losses as a result of this guarantee.
 
The Company is engaged in legal proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. In the opinion of management, none of these proceedings are material in relation to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
All revenue is domestic; therefore, the Company pays no foreign taxes. For the five months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, there were no material differences in the computations of the respective income tax benefits from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%.
 
The Company evaluated its September 30, 2011 consolidated financial statements for subsequent events through April 13, 2012, the date that the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. The Company is not aware of any subsequent events which would require recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed in note D.
On January 9, 2012, InfoSpace, Inc., a leader in online search, announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the "Company" for $287,500,000 in cash. The transaction closed on January 31, 2012. The "Company" is a wholly-owned subsidiary of InfoSpace, Inc. and will continue operations in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In connection with this transaction, the line of credit referred to in note C, which was renewed after its original expiration on September 29, 2011, was terminated on January 26, 2012, and all of the Company's equity interests were liquidated and terminated per the terms of the acquisition as of January 31, 2012.
 
Report of Independent Public Accountants
Board of Directors and Shareholders
2SS Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 2SS Holdings, Inc. (the "Company," a Delaware corporation) and Subsidiary as of April 30, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America as established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 2SS Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary as of April 30, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE A - NATURE OF THE BUSINESS
2SS Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary (collectively, the "Company") develops and markets personal and business tax preparation computer software and electronic filing services throughout the United States, primarily to private individuals and companies through the Internet under the TaxACT brand, located at www.taxact.com.
NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows.
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 2SS Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, 2nd Story Software, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and changes therein, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company maintains certain demand deposits that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insured limits. As of April 30, 2011 and 2010, uninsured balances totaled $6,914,000 and $4,177,000, respectively, from this concentration, representing the excess of the Company's demand deposits at FDIC-eligible institutions over the amounts that would have been covered by FDIC insurance. Concentration of credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents is considered to be low due to the credit quality of the issuers of the financial instruments held by the Company.
 
 
NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
 
A majority of the Company's accounts receivable are due from financial institutions. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of an enterprise's financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts outstanding greater than 90 days are generally deemed past due and uncollectible and are charged against an allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not accrued on past due accounts. The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts, if any, represents an estimate of potential accounts receivable write-offs associated with recognized revenue based on historical trends and factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers. At April 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary to cover estimated credit losses.
 
Inventories, consisting of blank CD-ROMs, packaging and software products purchased for resale, are carried at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or market.
 
Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
 
The Company recorded depreciation expense of $798,000, $743,000 and $548,000 for the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
The investment in limited liability company consists of an approximate 6.3% ownership interest in Free File Alliance, LLC ("FFA"), an association of private businesses committed to increasing the electronic filing of tax returns. The investment is accounted for under the equity method because the Company has one seat on the board of directors of FFA, but does not have a controlling interest. Accordingly, the cash contributions paid to FFA and the Company's proportionate share of FFA's net losses are recorded as an increase and decrease, respectively, in the value of the Company's investment in FFA.
 
 
NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
 
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets.
Such analyses necessarily involve judgment. The Company evaluated the carrying value of its long-lived assets at April 30, 2011 and 2010 and determined that long-lived assets are not impaired.
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to offset net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Effective May 1, 2009, the Company adopted new guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Under this guidance, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that such position would more likely than not be sustained following an audit by the relevant tax authority. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. At the adoption date, the Company applied the uncertain tax position guidance to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined that the adoption had no effect on the Company's consolidated statements of earnings or shareholders' equity. As required, the Company has assessed whether there remains any income tax exposure related to its tax positions as of April 30, 2011 and 2010. The Company does not believe there is any uncertainty with respect to its tax positions which would result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements.
If applicable, the Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as additional income tax expense. For the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company has recorded no expense for interest and penalties.
 
 
NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
 
The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in the state of Iowa. As of April 30, 2011, tax years open to examination by tax authorities under the statutes of limitations include years ended December 31, 2007 through 2010 for the Internal Revenue Service and for the Iowa Department of Revenue. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply.
 
Software Products
Revenue on shrink-wrapped software products or down-loaded versions of the software are typically recognized upon shipment or down-load, which is when title passes and risk transfers, provided that collection is reasonably assured and there are no significant remaining obligations. The Company does not offer customers the right to return products. If advance payments are received from customers, revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred until the products are shipped or down-loaded.
Services
The Company offers an electronic preparation and filing service which allows customers to complete and submit their tax returns to the appropriate tax authority over the Internet. The Company offers this service to individuals, businesses and tax preparers. Customers may obtain and use one of three versions of the service depending primarily upon the complexity of the customer's tax filings. Revenue for this service is recognized at the time the tax return is filed.
The Company offers email support free of charge to all customers, and with the sales of certain products, the Company also provides phone support for the use of the product, including both technical and tax preparation assistance. Customers using the professional version of the software must pay a separate one-time fee to receive support via phone. Since the support is provided within the fiscal year and generally within 60 days after the associated revenue is recognized, and is not material to the consolidated financial statements, there is no deferred support service at year end.
The Company also offers a data archive service to its customers. This service provides customers with access to their tax return information from the time of purchase through the third anniversary of the original filing deadline of the related return. Revenue for this hosting service is recognized ratably over this time period. Data archive fee amounts collected from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Bank Products
The Company offers customers the opportunity to make their tax payments or to receive their tax refunds through products offered by certain financial institutions. The Company receives a fee from the financial institutions per transaction and, for one of the banks, based on the volume of financial products sold to the Company's customers. Such fees are recognized as revenue when the related financial products are sold to the end customer.
 
 
NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
 
Revenue Arrangements That Include Multiple Elements
The Company uses the residual method to account for software products delivered upfront with service elements that are provided over time. Revenue for transactions that include both service elements (i.e. electronic preparation and filing, and data archive service) is allocated to each element based on vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of the fair value and is recognized for each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element. VSOE is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. The Company recognizes revenue for the electronic preparation and filing service only when all of the following criteria are satisfied: when the undelivered element, data archive service,is not essential to the functionality of delivered element, the tax return has been filed, and the fair value for the undelivered element is known. Revenue related to the data archive service is recognized ratably over the three year period beginning from the original filing deadline date.
 
The Company presents all non-income government-assessed taxes (sales, use and value added taxes) collected from its customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis (excluded from revenue) in its financial statements.
 
Shipping and handling costs resulting from sales of software products are expensed as incurred and included as a component of cost of sales and services in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
 
Cost of revenue include the costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries through websites and other electronic means, providing customer assistance by telephone, shipping and handling of products, research and development, credit card fees and royalties. Many of these costs are not directly attributable to a product or service and thus have been allocated based on various judgmental factors.
 
The Company's advertising consists mainly of newspaper, television, radio and Internet ads and is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $25,926,000, $21,519,000 and $18,474,000 for the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
 
NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
 
Software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, the Company's software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, no development costs have been capitalized. Costs incurred by the Company in connection with the enhancement of existing products, or after the general release of the services using the product, are expensed in the current period and included as a component of research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
 
All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of earnings over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
 
Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance clarifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (that is, an exit price). The exit price is based on the amount that the holder of the asset or liability would receive or need to pay in an actual transaction (or in a hypothetical transaction if an actual transaction does not exist) at the measurement date.
Fair value is generally determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company uses valuation techniques that place greater reliance on observable inputs and less reliance on unobservable inputs. In measuring fair value, the Company may make adjustments for risks and uncertainties, if a market participant would include such an adjustment in its pricing.
NOTE C - REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT
The Company has entered into an agreement with Cedar Rapids Bank and Trust Company for a revolving line of credit allowing for maximum borrowings of $3,000,000. Borrowings, if any, are collateralized by all assets owned and hereafter acquired by the Company. Interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly at the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the prime rate less 0.5% (effective rate of 5% at April 30, 2011). There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at April 30, 2011 or 2010. The agreement expires on September 29, 2011, and requires that the Company maintain certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth. As of April 30, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. See Note K for further information on the line of credit.
 
 
NOTE D - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A and Class B. The Class B common stock has the following specific rights and preferences:
- The Class B common stock has a liquidation preference of $19.8222 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon. The Company has no accrued but unpaid dividends as of April 30, 2011.
Preference
- The holders of shares of Class B common stock vote together with the holders of shares of Class A common stock on all matters (on an as-converted basis).
Voting
- Up to 50% of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock are redeemable by the Company, at the election of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock (a "Majority Interest"), on or after December 3, 2011. Furthermore, up to 100% of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock are redeemable by the Company, at the election of a Majority Interest, on or after December 3, 2012. Under either scenario, the redemption price shall be equal to the liquidation preference. Redemption is to be paid out of retained earnings of the Company or sales proceeds.
Redemption
- Each share of Class B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common stock upon the election of a holder thereof or upon the consummation of certain underwritten public offerings.
Conversion
- For so long as 10% of the originally issued shares of Class B common stock remain outstanding, certain actions of the Company require the consent (as a separate class) of a Majority Interest.
Restrictive Covenants
- There are no restrictions on the amount of dividends that can be made to stockholders. Total dividends paid by class of stockholder were proportional to the shares owned.
Dividends
 
 
NOTE E - LEASES
The Company leases office space under an agreement accounted for as an operating lease. The lease requires monthly payments of $30,800 plus all taxes, utilities and maintenance. The agreement expires on August 31, 2013, at which point the Company has the option to renew the lease for an additional two-year term with monthly rental payments increasing to $33,800.
Effective June 1, 2008, as amended, the Company subleases a portion of this office space under an agreement which requires the sublessor to make minimum monthly payments of $7,300 through May 2011. In May 2011, this agreement was extended with the same terms through May 2012. The amended agreement provides for a one year renewal term upon written notice. Sublease rental income received in connection with this agreement is recorded as an offset to rent expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.
Future minimum rental payments and collections required under these leases are as follows for the years ended April 30:
 
Total rent expense for each of the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $282,000, net of sublease rental income of $87,000 in 2011 and 2010 and $304,000 in 2009. In 2009, $30,000 of lease payments were paid to a related party.
NOTE F - LICENSING AGREEMENTS
The Company has entered into agreements with various developers of software products which require the Company to make royalty payments based on the number of items used, subject to a minimum annual cost.
Total royalty expense under these agreements for the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1,415,000, $1,243,000 and $1,120,000, respectively.
NOTE G - RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company has a 401(k) employee benefit plan for qualified employees. Employees are eligible to participate in the plan upon reaching 21 years of age and completing 1 hour of service. The Company has the ability to contribute a discretionary matching contribution based on the amount contributed by the participating employees. For the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company made matching contributions to the Plan of $118,000, $117,000 and $112,000, respectively.
 
 
NOTE H - STOCK OPTION PLAN
On May 20, 2005, the Company adopted the 2005 Stock Option and Grant Plan (the "Plan"), which provides both for the direct award or sale of restricted or unrestricted common shares and for the granting of either incentive or non-qualified stock options at the approval of the Company's Board of Directors or a designated representative thereof (hereinafter, the "Board"). The Plan authorizes grants of options to purchase a total of 45,401 shares of the Company's Class A common stock, including shares directly awarded or sold under the Plan. The option price per share and the term of each option will be determined by the Board, but the price for an incentive stock option shall generally not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the date of grant and the term for an incentive stock option shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. For those participants who are more than 10% stockholders, the option price shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant and the term shall not exceed five years from the date of grant. A participant's right to exercise an option vests over the term of the option, as determined by the Board.
The following is a summary of the status of the options granted under the Plan as of April 30, 2011, and changes for the year then ended:
 
No options were granted, cancelled, expired, exercised or forfeited for the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010.
The following table summarizes additional information as of April 30, 2011:
 
 
 
NOTE H - STOCK OPTION PLAN - Continued
 
The following is a summary of the status of the non-vested awards outstanding under the Plan as of April 30, 2011 and 2010, and changes for the years then ended:
 
The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options. The underlying share price fair value was originally determined based upon the share price actually paid by unrelated parties. The underlying share price was adjusted subsequently for further grants based upon the company performance and its impact on the estimated valuation. The Company used historical stock prices of companies which it considered as a peer group as the basis for its volatility assumptions. The assumed risk-free rates were based on U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the time of grant with a term consistent with the expected option terms. The Company estimated the expected term of the options assuming the exercise of the options upon vesting. The Company does not believe that changes in the assumptions used for volatility and expected term within a reasonable range could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company considers all employees to have similar exercise behavior and, therefore, has not identified separate homogenous groups for valuations.
The expense is being allocated using the straight-line method over the vesting period. The Company recorded compensation expense of $59,000, $80,000 and $78,000 for awards granted under the Plan for the years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of April 30, 2011, the Company had estimated unrecognized compensation expense of $17,000 related to stock options awarded under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.4 years.
The fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions below for the year ended April 30, 2009:
 
 
 
NOTE I - CONTINGENCIES
 
The Company guarantees the accuracy of the calculations in the Standard and Deluxe Editions of its TaxACT software. If the Internal Revenue Service assesses a penalty to a consumer due to a calculation error on the consumer's tax return as generated by the software, the Company will reimburse the consumer for the amount of the penalty plus any interest charges resulting from the error. This remedy is limited to the consumer's personal return and does not apply if a consumer uses TaxACT to prepare returns for other individuals or entities. This guarantee is voided if the consumer overrides the software calculations within the tax return. Consumers must submit reimbursement claims within 60 days of receiving notice of the error.
Through April 30, 2011, the Company has not experienced any material losses as a result of this guarantee.
 
The Company is engaged in legal proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. In the opinion of management, none of these proceedings are material in relation to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
 
NOTE J - INCOME TAXES
All revenue is domestic; therefore, the Company pays no foreign taxes. Significant components of the Company's deferred income taxes are as follows at April 30:
 
The components of deferred income taxes are as follows as of April 30:
 
The federal statutory income tax rate is reconciled to the Company's effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 as follows:
 
The Company's tax and fiscal years differ, as a result the book to tax deferred adjustments have varied somewhat year over year.
 
 
NOTE K - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Exhibit 99.1
 
BELLEVUE, Wash., May 9, 2012 (BUSINESS WIRE)  InfoSpace, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSP) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012 as well as preliminary TaxACT results for the 2011 tax season.
"We are pleased with our strong operating results in the first quarter," said Bill Ruckelshaus, President and Chief Executive Officer of InfoSpace. "The acquisition of TaxACT in January represents a significant milestone for our company, and substantially diversifies our overall business operations. We are pleased with the performance in both our search and tax preparation businesses and feel positive about our combined Company growth and profitability outlook."
 
 
See reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures in the accompanying financial statements.
Segment Information
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company acquired TaxACT, a leading provider of online tax solutions. As a result of the acquisition, the Company has changed its reporting to reflect how it measures the operating performance of its combined business. InfoSpace will now report two segments: Search and Tax Preparation. The Search segment includes all businesses operated by InfoSpace prior to the acquisition of TaxACT. The Tax Preparation segment represents the TaxACT business.
The operating segments exclude allocations for corporate operating expenses (certain general, administrative, and other overhead costs), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and other charges and non-operating gains or losses.
Search
Search revenue for the first quarter of 2012 was $75.3 million, up 46 percent from the first quarter of 2011. Search revenue reflects strong growth from search distribution, which increased 75 percent over the prior year and was driven by growth from both existing and new partners. Search segment income was $13.4 million, up 21 percent over first quarter of 2011.
Tax Preparation
The Company completed its acquisition of TaxACT on January 31, 2012. First quarter results include results for TaxACT from the acquisition through March 31, 2012.
Tax Preparation revenue for the first quarter of 2012 was $40.4 million. Tax Preparation segment income was $22.1 million or 55 percent of segment revenue for the first quarter of 2012.
Tax Season Update
TaxACT expects revenue growth for the tax season of 10 percent. Through April 18, 2012, total TaxACT consumer DDIY federal e-files were 5.0 million, up 8 percent compared to the same period last year.
"We are encouraged with the performance for the full season, and we believe we maintained share in the growing digital do-it-yourself market," said Ruckelshaus. "TaxACT professional preparer and consumer DDIY offerings represent outstanding value propositions for our customers. Our performance demonstrates that the message is resonating. Combined TaxACT offerings assisted more than 6 million filers this year."
Corporate Operating Expenses
Unallocated corporate operating expenses for the first quarter of 2012 were $3.8 million. Expenses include $1.1 million in transaction costs related to the TaxACT acquisition.
Second Quarter Outlook
For the second quarter of 2012, the Company expects revenues to be between $92.5 million and $96.5 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be between $20.0 million and $21.5 million, Non-GAAP Net Income to be between $16.9 million and $18.3 million, or $0.40 to 0.44 per diluted share, and Net Income to be between $5.5 million and $6.5 million, or $0.13 to $0.16 per diluted share.

Item 3.03.    Material Modifications to Rights of Security Holders
 
On August 9, 2012, the Preferred Stock Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") dated July 19, 2002 between Blucora, Inc. (the "Company") and Mellon Investor Services LLC (as rights agent) expired under the terms set forth in the Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 4.4 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 24, 2002, was originally entered into by the Company to protect and maximize the value of the outstanding equity interests in the Company in the event of an unsolicited attempt by an acquirer to take over the Company in a manner or on terms not approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The Rights Agreement granted the Company's stockholders one right (a "Right"), exercisable under certain specified circumstances, to purchase one one-thousandth share of the Company's Series C Participating Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred Stock") for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company. As a result of the expiration of the Rights Agreement, each outstanding share of the Company's common stock is no longer accompanied by a Right and all of the rights and restrictions set forth in the Rights Agreement have expired.
The expiration of the Rights Agreement and the Rights do not affect the stockholder-approved restrictions on the transfer of the Company's common stock as set forth in Section 4.3 of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which remain in effect.
 
 
Item 5.03.    Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
On August 10, 2012, the Company filed with the Delaware Secretary of State a Restated Certificate of Incorporation that combined into one document, pursuant to Section 245 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company's prior Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the amendments that were approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's 2012 annual meeting, and the elimination of the Series C Preferred Stock, as described below.

ab initio
(b) The restrictions contained in this Article 4 are for the purposes of reducing the risk that any "ownership change" of the Corporation Securities (as defined in the Code) may limit the Corporation's ability to utilize its Tax Benefits. In connection therewith, and to provide for effective policing of these provisions, a Restricted Holder who proposes to Acquire Corporation Securities shall, prior to the date of the proposed Acquisition, request in writing (a " ") that the Board of Directors of the Corporation (or a committee thereof that has been appointed by the Board of Directors) review the proposed Acquisition and authorize or not authorize the proposed Acquisition in accordance with this Section 4.3.2(b) of Article 4.

The Board of Directors may authorize an Acquisition by a Restricted Holder, if it determines, in its sole discretion, that, after taking into account the preservation of the Tax Benefits, such Acquisition would be in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders. Any determination by the Board of Directors not to authorize a proposed Acquisition by a Restricted Holder shall cause such proposed Acquisition to be deemed a Prohibited Transfer. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, impose any conditions that it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection with authorizing any such Acquisition by a Restricted Holder. In addition, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, require such representations from the Restricted Holder or such opinions of counsel to be rendered by counsel selected by the Board of Directors, in each case as to such matters as the Board of Directors may determine. Any Restricted Holder who makes a Request to the Board of Directors shall reimburse the Corporation, on demand, for all costs and expenses incurred by the Corporation with respect to any proposed Acquisition of Corporation Securities, including, without limitation, the Corporation's costs and expenses incurred in determining whether to authorize the proposed Acquisition, which costs may include, but are not limited to, any expenses of counsel and/or tax advisors engaged by the Board of Directors to advise the Board of Directors or deliver an opinion thereto.

Treatment of Excess Securities
(a) No employee or agent of the Corporation shall record any Prohibited Transfer, and the purported transferee of a Prohibited Transfer (the "") shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the Corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Corporation Securities which are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the ""). The Purported Transferee shall not be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities to any rights of stockholders of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof. Once the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, such Corporation Securities shall cease to be Excess Securities.
Purported Transferee
Excess Securities
(b) If the Board of Directors determines that a Prohibited Transfer has been recorded by an agent or employee of the Corporation notwithstanding the prohibition in Section 4.3.3(a) of this Article 4, such recording and the Prohibited Transfer shall be void and have no legal effect and, upon written demand by the Corporation, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported Transferee's possession or control, together with any dividends or other distributions that were received by the Purported Transferee from the Corporation with respect to the Excess Securities (the ""), to an agent designated by the Board of Directors (the ""). In the event of an attempted Prohibited Transfer involving the purchase or Acquisition of Corporation Securities in violation of this Article 4 by a Restricted Holder, the Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers, which may include the Corporation or the purported transferor, the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more arm's-length transactions (including over a national securities exchange or national securities quotation system on which the Corporation Securities may be traded); provided, however, that the Agent, in its sole discretion, shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if, in the Agent's discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the market for the Corporation Securities, would adversely affect the value of the Corporation Securities or would be in violation of applicable securities laws. If the Purported Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the Corporation's demand to surrender the Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the Corporation grants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds not exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to Section 4.3.3(c) of this Article 4 if the Agent, rather than the Purported Transferee, had resold the Excess Securities.
ab initio
Prohibited Distributions
Agent
(c) The Agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and, if the Purported Transferee had previously resold the Excess Securities, any amounts received by it from a Purported Transferee, as follows: (i) first, to reimburse itself to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in accordance with its duties hereunder; (ii) second, to reimburse the Purported Transferee for the amounts paid by the Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or in the case of any Prohibited Transfer by gift, devise or inheritance or any other Prohibited Transfer without consideration, the fair market value, calculated on the basis of the closing market price for the Corporation Securities on the day before the Prohibited Transfer), and (iii) third, the remainder, if any, to the original transferor, or, if the original transferor cannot be readily identified, to an entity designated by the Corporation's Board of Directors that is described in Section 501(c) of the Code, contributions to which must be eligible for deduction under each of Sections 170(b)(1)(A), 2055 and 2522 of the Code. The recourse of any Purported Transferee with respect of any Prohibited Transfer shall be limited to the amount payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 4.3.3.(c) of this Article 4. Except as may be required by law, in no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to this Article 4 inure to the benefit of the Corporation or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover expenses incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder.
(d) If the Purported Transferee fails to surrender the Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof to the Agent within thirty (30) days from the date on which the Corporation makes a demand pursuant to Section (3)(b) of this Article 4, then the Corporation may take such actions as it deems necessary to enforce the provisions hereof, including the institution of legal proceedings to compel such surrender.
(e) If any Person shall knowingly violate, or knowingly cause any other Person under control of such Person (a "") to violate this Article 4, then that Person and any Controlled Person shall be jointly and severally liable for, and shall pay to the Corporation, such amount as will, after taking account of all taxes imposed with respect to the receipt or accrual of such amount and all costs incurred by the Corporation as a result of such violation, put the Corporation in the same financial position as it would have been in had such violation not occurred.
Controlled Person

Section 4.3.5
Legends; Compliance
All certificates reflecting Corporation Securities on or after the Effective Date shall, until the Restriction Release Date, bear a conspicuous legend in substantially the following form:
THE TRANSFER OF SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE FOUR OF THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF INFOSPACE, INC., AS AMENDED AND IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CORPORATION UPON REQUEST.
(b) The Corporation shall have the power to make appropriate notations upon its stock transfer records and to instruct any transfer agent, registrar, securities intermediary or depository with respect to the requirements of this Article 4 for any uncertificated Corporation Securities or Corporation Securities held in an indirect holding system.
(c) Nothing contained in this Article 4 shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to take such other action to the extent permitted by law as it deems necessary or advisable to preserve the Corporation's Tax Benefits. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the power to determine all matters necessary for determining compliance with this Article 4, including, without limitation, determining (i) the identification of Five Percent Shareholders and Restricted Holders, (ii) whether a Transfer or proposed Transfer is a Prohibited Transfer, (iii) the Percentage Stock Ownership in the Corporation of any Five Percent Shareholders and Restricted Holders, (iv) whether an instrument constitutes a Corporation Security, (v) the amount (or fair market value) due to a Purported Transferee, (vi) the interpretation of the provisions of this Article 4, and (vii) any other matters which the Board of Directors deems relevant. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Article 4, including any definition used herein, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions with respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or knowledge of the circumstances. In the event that this Article 4 requires an action by the Board of Directors but fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of this Article 4. All such actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations that are done or made by the Board of Directors in good faith shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Corporation, the Agent, and all other parties to a Transfer; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may delegate all or any portion of its duties and powers under this Article 4 to a committee of the Board of Directors as it deems advisable or necessary.
(d) Nothing contained in this Article 4 shall be construed to give any Person other than the Corporation or the Agent any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Article 4. This Article 4 shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Corporation and the Agent.
(e) If any provision of this Article 4 or the application of any such provision to any Person or under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Article 4.
The Board shall be composed of not less than 5 nor more than 9 Directors, the specific number to be set by resolution of the Board, provided that the Board may be less than 5 until vacancies are filled. No decrease in the number of Directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent Director.
Prior to the 1999 annual election of Directors, unless a Director earlier dies, resigns or is removed, his or her term of office shall expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders. At the 1999 annual election of Directors, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, with said classes to be as equal in number as may be possible. At the first election of Directors to such classified Board of Directors, each Class I Director shall be elected to serve until the next ensuing annual meeting of stockholders, each Class II Director shall be elected to serve until the second ensuing annual meeting of stockholders and each Class III Director shall be elected to serve until the third ensuing annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders following the meeting at which the Board of Directors is initially classified, the number of Directors equal to the number of Directors in the class whose term expires at the time of such meeting shall be elected to serve until the third ensuing annual meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Article 5, Directors shall serve until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal from office or until there is a decrease in the number of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders of the corporation or residents of the State of Delaware and need not meet any other qualifications.
The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation; provided, however, the Board of Directors may not repeal or amend any bylaw that the stockholders have expressly provided may not be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation.
Preemptive rights shall not exist with respect to shares of stock or securities convertible into shares of stock of the corporation.
The right to cumulate votes in the election of Directors shall not exist with respect to shares of stock of the corporation.
The corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, any of the provisions contained in this Certificate of Incorporation. The rights of the stockholders of the corporation are granted subject to this reservation.
To the full extent that the Delaware General Corporation Law, as it exists on the date hereof or may hereafter be amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, a director of the corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Any amendment to or repeal of this Article 10 shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
Only action properly brought before the stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a written consent setting forth the action so taken is signed by the holders of outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to be voted with respect to the subject matter thereof having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
In addition to any affirmative vote required by law, this Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise, any "Business Combination" (as hereinafter defined) involving this corporation shall be subject to approval in the manner set forth in this Article 12.

12.2.2 Notwithstanding subsection 12.2.1 of this Article 12, if a Business Combination shall have been approved by at least two-thirds of the Board of Directors, and is otherwise required by law to be approved by this corporation's stockholders, such Business Combination shall require the affirmative vote of not less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon and, to the extent, if any, provided by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of a series of Common or Preferred Stock, not less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the outstanding shares of such series, voting as a class; provided, however, that if a Business Combination approved by at least two-thirds of the Board of Directors is not otherwise required by law to be approved by this corporation's stockholders, then no vote of the stockholders of this corporation shall be required.

Segment Information
Search
Search revenue for the third quarter of 2012 was $91.4 million, up 62 percent from the third quarter of 2011. Search revenue reflects strong growth from search distribution, which increased 78 percent over the prior year. Search segment income was $16.4 million, up 51 percent over the third quarter of 2011.
Tax Preparation
Tax Preparation revenue for the third quarter of 2012 was $1.5 million, and segment loss was $1.6 million. Tax preparation typically posts a seasonal loss in the third quarter when there is little revenue from its tax business.

For the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company expects revenues to be between $92.0 million and $95.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be between $10.0 million and $11.0 million, Non-GAAP Net Income to be between $7.7 million and $8.9 million, or $0.18 to 0.21 per diluted share, and Net Income to be between breakeven and $1.0 million, or $0.00 to $0.02 per diluted share.

Actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations due to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general economic, industry, and market sector conditions; the timing and extent of market acceptance of developed products and services and related costs; our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services; the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; future acquisitions; the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives, operating plans, and marketing strategies; and the condition of our cash investments. A more detailed description of these and certain other factors that could affect actual results is included in Blucora, Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. Blucora, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blucora's Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP earnings per share is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income (loss) to exclude the effects of discontinued operations, net of taxes (which includes loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes), loss from the sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain or loss on derivatives, the cash tax impact of those adjustments to GAAP net income, and non-cash portion of income tax expense from continuing operations, as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited). The Company excludes the non-cash portion of income tax expense because of its ability to offset a substantial portion of its cash tax liabilities by using these deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets will expire if unutilized in 2020.
Blucora's management believes that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share provide meaningful supplemental information to management, investors and analysts regarding the Company's performance and the valuation of its business by excluding items in the statement of operations that management does not consider part of the Company's ongoing operations or have not been, or are not expected to be, settled in cash. Additionally, Blucora's management believes that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are common measures used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company's performance and the valuation of its business.
Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be evaluated in light of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income.

On December 31, 2012, William Ruckelshaus, Chief Executive Officer and President of Blucora, Inc. ("Blucora"), executed an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Employment Agreement") that replaces the previous agreement between Blucora and Mr. Ruckelshaus. Blucora's primary reasons for entering into this Employment Agreement were to make the terms of Mr. Ruckelshaus's employment more consistent with the terms of the agreements with Blucora's other executives and to extend the term of his agreement. The material terms of this Employment Agreement are as follows:
- The term of the Employment Agreement is three years from the December 31, 2012 effective date.
- Mr. Ruckelshaus's base salary is set at $450,000, with a target bonus of 100% of his base salary, measured against criteria and targets set by the Blucora Board of Directors.
- The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement revises the severance payments that Mr. Ruckelshaus would receive upon termination without Cause or in the case of Constructive Termination, as defined in the Employment Agreement. As revised, such payments would include a lump sum severance payment of an amount equal to his annual salary, an amount equal to his target bonus, and an amount sufficient for 12 months of medical insurance coverage.
- The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement also revises Mr. Ruckelshaus's severance payments and benefits upon a Change of Control or a Significant Corporate Transaction, as defined in the Employment Agreement. The revised terms include a double-trigger severance payments and benefits if he is terminated without cause or leaves for good reason either two months before or within one year after such a transaction. Such payments and benefits would consist of a lump sum severance payment of an amount equal to 150% of the sum of his annual salary and his target annual bonus, an amount sufficient for 18 months of medical insurance coverage, acceleration of 100% of his unvested equity, and a 24-month extension of post-termination option exercise rights.
The above description is only a summary of the material terms, does not purport to be a complete description of the Employment Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Agreement, a copy of which will be attached in full as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BELLEVUE, Wash., February 13, 2013 (BUSINESS WIRE)  Blucora, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCOR) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2012.
"The success of online search and tax preparation led Blucora to strong results for fiscal year 2012," said Bill Ruckelshaus, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blucora. "We are pleased with our performance in both businesses in the fourth quarter and full year 2012. TaxACT entered the current tax season with momentum, driven by core product enhancements, content support improvements, and marketing programs aimed at increasing consumer awareness."
Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
See reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures below.
Segment Information
Search
Search revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 reflects strong growth from search distribution, up 52 percent and 67 percent over the fourth quarter and full year 2011, respectively. Search segment income for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 was $17.4 million and $62.2 million, up 36 percent and 35 percent over the fourth quarter and full year 2011, respectively.
Tax Preparation
Tax Preparation segment loss for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $2.5 million. Tax preparation typically posts a seasonal loss in the fourth quarter when there is little revenue from its tax business. Tax Preparation segment income for the full year 2012 was $30.1 million. This figure excludes TaxACT operating results before January 31, 2012 as the Company acquired TaxACT on that date.
Corporate Operating Expenses
Unallocated corporate operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 were $2.8 million and $11.8 million, up 6 percent and 23 percent over the fourth quarter and full year 2011, respectively.
Share Repurchase Program
The Company's board of directors has approved a share repurchase program of up to $50 million of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock. Under the program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market for a two-year period.
First Quarter Outlook
For the first quarter of 2013, the Company expects revenues to be between $156.0 million and $161.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be between $43.0 million and $45.0 million, Non-GAAP Net Income to be between $39.5 million and $41.5 million, or $0.93 to $0.97 per diluted share, and Net Income to be between $20.5 and $22.0 million, or $0.48 to $0.52 per diluted share. The Company's forward-looking guidance does not reflect potential gains or losses from derivative instruments.
Conference Call and Webcast
A conference call and live webcast will be held today at 2 p.m. Pacific time / 5 p.m. Eastern time during which the Company will further discuss fourth quarter and full year results and its outlook including tax preparation segment guidance for the first half of 2013, search segment guidance for the first quarter 2013 and search segment expectations for 2013.

On February 14, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Blucora, Inc. Board of Directors approved the 2013 Executive Bonus Plan. This plan provides for annual performance-based cash bonuses to the Company's executive officers. The target bonus amount for individual executive officers varies, and is between 50% and 100% of each executive's base salary.
The available bonus for each executive is based on a combination of (a) the Company's achievement of certain specified financial or operational performance measurements and (b) the individual performance of each executive and the discretion of the CEO (or, in the case of CEO bonus, the discretion of the Compensation Committee). For the financial or operational performance components, the specific measures vary by executive, but may include Company Revenue (as defined in the plan), Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the plan), and/or certain measurements that are specific to the business unit that the individual executive is responsible for. Of the total available bonus payout, 80% is based on the financial and operational performance component and 20% is based on the individual performance/discretionary component.
The performance targets established for this bonus plan correspond to the operating plan targets approved by the Blucora Board of Directors. The range of possible bonus component achievement is 0% to 165% of the target bonus for the operational and financial performance components and 0% to 100% for the individual performance/discretionary component, with the result that the aggregate maximum available payout level is 152%.
The foregoing description of the 2013 Executive Bonus Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of this plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: February 15, 2013
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
This plan document outlines the Blucora Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan") for calendar year 2013.
PLAN OBJECTIVES
 
 
 
EFFECTIVE DATE
The Plan was adopted by the Compensation Committee on February 14, 2013, and is effective for calendar year 2013.
1
The Plan may be changed at any time at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
PARTICIPATION ELIGIBILITY, BONUS TARGETS AND PAYOUT TIMING
The positions eligible for participation in the Plan are listed in the table below. Each participant's annual bonus target, which is stated as a percentage of annual base salary, is also set forth in the table below. If the executive leadership team changes composition, any additions to the Plan will be recommended by the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee. Payment of bonuses awarded under this Plan will be made annually, following the conclusion of the calendar year.
 
PLAN DESIGN
The Plan includes financial performance components and a component that is based on individual objectives and the CEO's (or, with respect to the CEO, the Compensation Committee's) subjective evaluation of that individual's performance. The financial performance components collectively represent 80% of the bonus target, and the objectives/discretionary component represents 20% of the bonus target. The financial performance components, and the weightings of the financial performance components, differ among plan participants as noted in the table below.
 
 
Each financial performance component may be achieved at a percentage ranging from 0 to 165%, and the objectives/discretionary component may be achieved at a percentage ranging from 0% to 100%, with the result that the aggregate maximum payout level under the Plan is 152%. The Executive Bonus Payment Scale set forth below is applicable to determine the achievement of financial performance components. The financial performance component targets at 100% match the corresponding operating plan targets approved by the Board of Directors in November 2012. The level of achievement of the objectives/discretionary component is subjectively determined on a semi-annual basis by the CEO (or, with respect to the CEO, by the Compensation Committee).
Financial Targets
The financial performance components used to determine the bonus achievement are defined as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Bonus Scale
The Executive Bonus Payment Scale below will be used to calculate the available amounts to be paid to executives based on the financial performance components.
 
 
 
 
 
EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
In order to be eligible for a bonus payment under the Plan, and for a bonus to be considered earned under the Plan, participants must be employed at the end of the fiscal year; provided, however, that if a participant's employment is terminated during the year "without Cause" or by the participant for "Good Reason" or due to "Constructive Termination" as such terms are defined in the applicable participant's employment agreement, then the participant will be entitled to accrued bonus as of the date of his or her termination. Accrued bonus will be calculated as (a) pro-rata achievement of financial performance components based on the then-current annual forecast and (b) pro-rata achievement of the objectives/discretionary component at the level communicated at the conclusion of the semi-annual measurement period, or with respect to any measurement period which has not yet been completed and communicated, achievement of the objectives/discretionary component at the level subjectively determined by the CEO (or, with respect to the CEO, the Compensation Committee).
APPROVAL
All bonus payments made to executives will be submitted to the Compensation Committee for final approval. The Compensation Committee may adjust the final bonus amount as it deems appropriate. The Committee has complete discretion to adjust bonus awards to reflect changes in the industry, company, the executive's job duties or performance, or any other circumstance the Committee determines should impact bonus awards.

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., March 11, 2013 - Blucora, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCOR) announced today the pricing of its offering of $175 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Convertible Notes") in a private placement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). We have also granted the initial purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $26.25 million principal amount of Convertible Notes, solely to cover over-allotments. The sale of the Convertible Notes is expected to close on March 15, 2013, subject to customary closing conditions.
Blucora expects that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $168.8 million, after deducting discounts to the initial purchasers and estimated offering expenses payable by Blucora. Blucora intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
The Convertible Notes will be general unsecured senior obligations of Blucora. The Convertible Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2013. The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2019, unless earlier purchased, redeemed, or converted.
On or before June 30, 2013, the notes will not be convertible under any circumstances. Following June 30, 2013, and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2018, the Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions. On or after October 1, 2018, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option at the conversion rate then in effect at any time, irrespective of these conditions. Blucora will settle conversions of the Convertible Notes by delivering shares of Blucora common stock at a specified conversion rate. However, if Blucora obtains stockholder approval in accordance with applicable NASDAQ rules, Blucora will settle conversions of the Convertible Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election.
The conversion rate will initially be 46.1723 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.66 per share of common stock, a conversion premium of 40%). The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.
Blucora may not redeem the notes prior to April 6, 2016. Blucora may redeem for cash all or part of the notes, at its option, on or after April 6, 2016, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No "sinking fund" is provided for the notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the notes periodically.
If Blucora undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), holders may require Blucora to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. In addition, if certain fundamental changes occur, Blucora may be required in certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for any Convertible Notes converted in connection with such fundamental changes by a specified number of shares of its common stock.
This offering is being made to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Neither the Convertible Notes nor any shares of Blucora's common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes have been or are expected to be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exception from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation, or any sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.

(B) by written notice to all Holders of Notes, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent on or prior to the 30th Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, in the case of any conversion occurring on or after such date, other than during a Redemption Period; or
(C) by written notice to the converting Holder, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent, prior to the Close of Business on the first Scheduled Trading Day following the relevant Conversion Date, in the case of any other conversion.
(iv) Any Settlement Method Notice shall specify the relevant Settlement Method and in the case of an election of Combination Settlement, the relevant Settlement Method Notice shall indicate the Specified Dollar Amount. If the Company has received Stockholder Approval and does not timely deliver a Settlement Method prior to the deadline set forth in this Section 11.03(b)(iii), the Company shall no longer have the right to elect Cash Settlement or Physical Settlement and the Company shall be deemed to have elected Combination Settlement in respect of its Conversion Obligation, and the Specified Dollar Amount per $1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be equal to $1,000. If the Company elects Combination Settlement in respect of its Conversion Obligation but does not indicate a Specified Dollar Amount in the relevant Settlement Method Notice, the Specified Dollar Amount shall be deemed to be $1,000. The Company agrees that it will not seek Stockholder Approval during a Redemption Period or during the period following the 30
th
Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date through the Maturity Date.
(v) The cash, shares of Common Stock or combination of cash and shares of Common Stock in respect of any conversion of Notes (the "") shall be computed as follows:
Settlement Amount
(A) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by Physical Settlement, the Company shall deliver to the converting Holder in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 11.03(b)(vii);
 
(B) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by Cash Settlement, the Company shall pay to the converting Holder in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted cash in an amount equal to the sum of the Daily Conversion Values for each of the 25 consecutive VWAP Trading Days during the related Observation Period; and
(C) if the Company elects (or is deemed to have elected) to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by Combination Settlement, the Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted, a Settlement Amount equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 25 consecutive VWAP Trading Days during the related Observation Period.
(vi) The Daily Settlement Amounts (if applicable) and the Daily Conversion Values (if applicable) shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Observation Period. Promptly after such determination of the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the case may be, and the amount of cash payable in lieu of any fractional share, the Company shall notify the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) of the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the case may be, and the amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) shall have no responsibility for any such determination.
(vii) The Company shall not issue any fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes and shall instead pay cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion based on the Daily VWAP on the relevant Conversion Date (in the case of Physical Settlement) or based on the Daily VWAP on the last VWAP Trading Day of the relevant Observation Period (in the case of Combination Settlement). For each Note surrendered for conversion, if the Company has elected Combination Settlement, the full number of shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Daily Settlement Amounts for the applicable Observation Period and any fractional shares remaining after such computation shall be paid in cash.
(viii) The Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, the consideration due in respect of the Conversion Obligation on the third Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date, if the Company elects Physical Settlement, or on the third Business Day immediately following the last VWAP Trading Day of the Observation Period, in the case of any other Settlement Method.
(c) If a Holder surrenders more than one Note for conversion on a single Conversion Date, the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, that the Company will deliver, and the amount of cash that the Company will pay pursuant to Section 11.03(a) or Section 11.03(b)(vii) in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock, if any, shall be determined based on the total principal amount of Notes so surrendered by such Holder.
 
(d) If a Holder converts a Note, except as set forth in Section 11.02(g), (i) such Holder shall not receive any separate cash payment (in addition to the Conversion Obligation) for accrued and unpaid interest on such Note and (ii) the Company's delivery to such converting Holder of the Conversion Obligation shall be deemed to satisfy in full the Company's obligation to pay to such Holder (A) the principal amount of such converted Note and (B) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date. As a result, subject to Section 11.02(g), accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on a converted Note to but, excluding, the relevant Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Upon a conversion of Notes, subject to Section 11.02(g), accrued and unpaid interest, if any, shall be deemed to be paid first out of the cash paid upon such conversion, if any.
(e) .
Notices
(i) On the second Business Day immediately following the Conversion Date for any Notes, the Company shall deliver written notice to the Trustee stating (2) the aggregate principal amount of Notes converted on such Conversion Date, (3) whether the Company has made a Settlement Method election with respect to such Conversion Date, and (4) if the Company has made a Settlement Method election for such Conversion Date, the Specified Dollar Amount for such Conversion Date (if applicable).
(ii) On the first Business Day immediately following the last VWAP Trading Day of the Observation Period for each Conversion Date to which Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement applies, the Company shall deliver written notice to the Trustee stating (1) the aggregate principal amount of Notes that were converted on such Conversion Date, (2) the aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate number of Shares that the Company is obligated to deliver to settle all of the Notes converted on such Conversion Date, and (3) the Daily Conversion Values or Daily Settlement Amounts, as the case may be, for each VWAP Trading Day of the Observation Period for such Conversion Date.
(iii) If the Company receives Stockholder Approval on any day, the Company shall so notify Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent prior to the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately following such day that the Stockholder Approval is received.
Section 11.04
. Covenants Relating to Underlying Shares.
(a) The Company shall, until all Notes cease to be outstanding and any consideration due upon conversion has been paid or delivered, as the case may be, reserve out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock that have not been reserved for other purposes a number of shares of Common Stock, in the aggregate, equal to the product of the Maximum Conversion Rate and the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding (expressed in thousands of dollars), to permit the conversion of the Notes.
 
(b) The Company covenants that any shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Notes shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, and shall be free from preemptive rights and shall be free of any lien or adverse claim or from any taxes or charges with respect to the issue thereof.
(c) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission, secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
(d) In addition, the Company will cause any such shares of Common Stock to be listed on any stock exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed and will comply with any stock exchange rules applicable to the Notes and/or the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
Section 11.05The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as described in this Section 11.05, except that the Company shall not make any adjustments to the Conversion Rate for any Holder that participates (as a result of holding the Notes, and at the same time as the holders of the Common Stock participate) in any of the transactions described below as if such Holder held, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes held, a number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, without having to convert its Notes.
. Adjustments to the Conversion Rate.
(a) . If the Ex-Dividend Date occurs for any issuance by the Company of solely shares of the Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on all or substantially all of the shares of the Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or a share combination of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Dividends, Distributions, Splits and Combinations
 
where:
 
 
Any adjustment made under this Section 11.05(a) shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date for such share split or combination, as the case may be. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 11.05(a) is declared but not so paid or made, then the Conversion Rate shall immediately be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had such dividend or distribution not been declared or announced. The "effective date," with respect to a share split or combination, means the first date on which the shares of the Common Stock trade in the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, reflecting the relevant share split or share combination, as applicable.
(b) . If the Ex-Dividend Date occurs for any issuance by the Company to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock of any rights, options or warrants entitling the holders of such rights, options or warrants for a period of not more than 60 calendar days after the announcement date of such issuance to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Adjustment for Rights Issue
 
where:
 
Any adjustment made under this Section 11.05(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the
 
Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, as of the date of such expiration, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall immediately be readjusted, as of the scheduled issuance date, to equal the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the relevant adjustment pursuant to this Section 11.05(b) not occurred.
For purposes of this Section 11.05(b) and Section 11.01(b)(iii)(A), in determining whether any issued rights, options or warrants entitle the holders of the Common Stock to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for each Trading Day in the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration that the Company receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(c) .
Other Distributions
(i) If the Ex-Dividend Date occurs for a distribution by the Company of shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property of the Company or rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding (A) dividends or distributions (including subdivisions) and rights, options or warrants, in each case, for which an adjustment is made pursuant to Sections 11.05(a) or 11.05(b); (B) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash for which an adjustment is made pursuant to Section 11.05(d); and (C) Spin-Offs for which an adjustment is made pursuant to Section 11.05(c)(ii) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities, the ""), then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
 
where:
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "SP
0
" (as defined above) minus "FMV" (as defined above) is less than $1.00, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, each Holder shall receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes held, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock, the kind and amount of Distributed Property that such Holder would have received as if such Holder had owned a number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the record date for such distribution.
Any adjustment made under this Section 11.05(c)(i) shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, or if any rights, options or warrants are not exercised before their expiration date, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such distribution or as of such expiration date, as the case may be, to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had such distribution not been declared or to the extent such rights or warrants are not exercised, as applicable.
(ii) With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11.05(c), if the relevant dividend or other distribution consists of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company that are listed for trading or quoted (or will be listed or quoted upon consummation of the spin-off) on a U.S. national securities exchange (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
where:
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if the last VWAP Trading Day of the Observation Period for any conversion to which Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement applies occurs on or after the effective date for the Spin-Off, but less than ten Trading Days immediately following, and including, the effective date for the Spin-Off, references within this Section 11.05(c)(ii) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected Daily Conversion Values or Daily Settlement Amounts, as the case may be, in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the effective date for the Spin-Off to, and including, the last VWAP Trading Day of such Observation Period, and (B) for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate applicable to any conversion for which the Conversion Date occurs during the ten Trading Days commencing on the effective date for any Spin-Off, references within this Section 11.05(c)(ii) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the effective date for such Spin-Off to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11.05(c)(ii) shall become effective as of the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off. If such Spin-Off is subsequently cancelled and does not become effective, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, as of the date of such cancellation, to be the Conversion Rate that would have been in effect if such Spin-Off had not been declared.
For purposes of this Section 11.05(c) (and subject in all respect to Section 11.05(i)), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (A) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (B) are not exercisable; and (C) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 11.05(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11.05(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 11.05(c). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the
Trigger Event
 
immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11.05(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
For purposes of Section 11.05(a), Section 11.05(b) and this Section 11.05(c), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11.05(c) is applicable also includes one or both of:
(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 11.05(a) is applicable (the ""); or
Clause A Distribution
(B) a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which Section 11.05(b) is applicable (the ""),
Clause B Distribution
then (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 11.05(c) is applicable (the "") and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11.05(c) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made, and (2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 11.05(a) and Section 11.05(b) with respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Company (I) the "Ex-Dividend Date" of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to be the Ex-Dividend Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be "outstanding immediately prior to the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date or effective date" within the meaning of Section 11.05(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning of Section 11.05(b).
Clause C Distribution
(d) . If the Ex-Dividend Date occurs for any cash dividend or distribution by the Company to all or substantially all holders of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Adjustment for Cash Distributions
 
where:
 
If "SP
0
" (as defined above) minus "C" (as defined above) is less than $1.00, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, each Holder shall receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes held, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock, the amount of cash such Holder would have received if such Holder had owned a number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the record date for such distribution.
Any adjustment made under this Section 11.05(d) shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such distribution, to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the related Ex-Dividend Date not occurred.
(e) . If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment to holders of the Common Stock in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Adjustment for Tender Offers or Exchange Offers
Expiration Date
 
where:
 
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11.05(e) shall be given effect at the Close of Business on the Expiration Date. If the Expiration Date is less than ten Trading Days prior to, and including, the last VWAP Trading Day of the Observation Period in respect of any conversion to which Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement applies, references within this Section 11.05(e) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected Daily Conversion Values or Daily Settlement Amounts, as the case may be, in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date to, and including, the last VWAP Trading Day of such Observation Period. For purposes of determining the Conversion Rate applicable to any conversion during the ten Trading Day period commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date, references within this Section 11.05(e) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date.
(f) . Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in clauses (a) through (e) above, if any adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to such provisions becomes effective on any Ex-Dividend Date or effective date and a Holder that has converted its Notes would (i) receive shares of Common Stock based on an adjusted Conversion Rate and (ii) be a record holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the dividend, distribution or event giving rise to such adjustment, then, in lieu of receiving shares of Common Stock at such an adjusted Conversion Rate, such Holder shall receive a number of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon conversion based on an unadjusted Conversion Rate and shall participate in the related dividend, distribution or other event giving rise to such adjustment.
Holder Participation in Adjustment Events
(g) . If, in the case of any conversion of a Note to which Combination Settlement applies, on any VWAP Trading Day during the Observation Period corresponding to the Conversion Date for such Note, shares of Common Stock are deliverable as part of the Daily Settlement Amount for such VWAP Trading Day, and
Adjustments Not Yet Effective
 
(i) the record date for any dividend or distribution, the effective date for any share split or combination or the Expiration Date for any tender or exchange offer by the Company that, in each case, would require an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11.05(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) occurs prior to the Company's delivery of such shares of Common Stock to the converting Holder;
(ii) the applicable Conversion Rate for such VWAP Trading Day will not reflect such adjustment; and
(iii) the shares of Common Stock that the Company shall deliver to the converting Holder with respect to such VWAP Trading Day are not entitled to participate in the relevant event (because such shares were not held by such Holder on the related record date, effective date, expiration date or otherwise),
then the Company shall adjust the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable to such Holder as part of the Daily Settlement Amount for such VWAP Trading Day in a manner that appropriately reflects the relevant distribution, transaction or event.
(h) . Whenever any provision of this Indenture requires the Company to calculate the Last Reported Sale Prices over a span of multiple days, the Company shall make appropriate adjustments to such prices to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event that would require an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date, effective date or Expiration Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period over which such Last Reported Sale Prices are to be calculated.
Other Adjustments
(i) . To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of any Note, each share of Common Stock issued upon such conversion (x) shall be entitled to receive the number of rights, if any, associated with one share of Common Stock under such rights plan, and (y) shall, if issued in certificated form, bear such legends, if any, as may be required under such rights plan; , , that if prior to the Conversion Date for such Note, the rights have separated from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable rights plan, the converting Holder shall not be entitled to receive such rights upon conversion, and at the time of such separation, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 11.05(c) as if the Company made a distribution of Distributed Property to the holders of the Common Stock; , , that such adjustment shall be subject to readjustment upon the expiration, termination or redemption of such separated rights in accordance with Section 11.05(c).

No Other Adjustments
(m) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clauses (a) through (e) above, if the application of the formulas set forth therein would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made, other than as a result of a reverse share split or share combination; that in the case of an increase in the Conversion Rate in connection with any Spin-Off, distribution on the Common Stock or issuance of rights, options or warrants to holders of Common Stock, such increase may be reversed, to the extent expressly set forth herein, on account of the cancellation of such Spin-Off, such distribution not being paid or made or the expiration of such rights, options or warrants.

Unless and until a Trust Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officer's Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which such adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder at its last address appearing on the Register.

(a) In the case of:
(i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock (other than a change resulting from a subdivision or combination for which an adjustment is provided pursuant to Section 11.05);
(ii) any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction involving the Company;

Unit of Reference Property
provided
If a Share Exchange Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), then (i) the Reference Property shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election, and (ii) the Unit of Reference Property for purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph shall refer to the consideration referred to in clause (i) attributable to one share of Common Stock. The Company shall notify Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) of such weighted average as soon as practicable after such determination is made.
Such supplemental indenture described in the second immediately preceding paragraph shall provide for anti-dilution and other adjustments that are as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this Article 11. If the Reference Property in respect of any Share

(ii) if the Stock Price is greater than $100.00 (subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the Stock Prices listed in the table), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate; and
 
(iii) if the Stock Price is less than $15.47 (subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the Stock Prices listed in the table), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.07, in no event shall the Conversion Rate exceed 64.6412 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment at the same time and in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11.05 (the "").

Additional Notes may be issued in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture.

Indenture
Trustee
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of, and interest on, all Notes may be declared, by either the Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, and upon said declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions and certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make all payments and deliveries in respect of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date and the principal amount on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the Holder who surrenders a Note to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Note. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, and in certain other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures modifying the terms of the Indenture and the Notes as described therein. It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay or deliver, as the case may be, the principal (including the Fundamental Change Purchase Price, if applicable) of, accrued and unpaid interest on, and the consideration due upon conversion of, this Note at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the lawful money herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples thereof. At the office or agency of the Company referred to on the face hereof, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture,
 
Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations, without payment of any service charge but, if required by the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer or similar tax that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such exchange of Notes being different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such exchange. The Trustee (or, if applicable, such other entity appointed as Registrar in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) need not transfer or exchange any Notes in respect of which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Note to be repurchased in part, the portion of the Note not to be repurchased).
The Notes shall be redeemable at the Company's option in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Indenture.
Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Holder has the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase for cash all of such Holder's Notes or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date at a price equal to the Fundamental Change Purchase Price.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder hereof has the right, at its option, during certain periods and upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the Indenture, prior to the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, to convert any Notes or portion thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into shares of Common Stock or, following Stockholder Approval, cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof, based on the Conversion Rate specified in the Indenture, as adjusted from time to time as provided in the Indenture.
Terms used in this Note and defined in the Indenture are used herein as therein defined.

Exhibit 99.1
BELLEVUE, Wash., March 15, 2013 - Blucora, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCOR) announced today the closing of its previously announced private offering of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Convertible Notes"). Blucora issued $201.25 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (which includes $26.25 million aggregate principal amount of notes issued pursuant to the initial purchasers' exercise in full of their over-allotment option). The offering and sale of the Convertible Notes was made through a private placement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $194.2 million, after deducting discounts to the initial purchasers and estimated offering expenses payable by Blucora. Blucora intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
The Convertible Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of Blucora. The Convertible Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2013. The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2019, unless earlier purchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms.
This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful. The Convertible Notes and the shares of Blucora common stock, if any, issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.

The Employment Agreement replaces the previous agreement between Blucora and Mr. Glover. Blucora's primary reason for entering into this Employment Agreement was to make the terms of Mr. Glover's employment more consistent with the terms of the agreements with Blucora's other executives. The material terms of this Employment Agreement are as follows:
- The term of the Employment Agreement is three years from the March 15, 2013 effective date.
- Mr. Glover's base salary is set at $245,000, with a target bonus of 70% of his base salary, measured against criteria and targets set by the Blucora Board of Directors. He is also eligible to receive a one-time incentive bonus of $165,000 upon the achievement of certain specified objectives.
- Mr. Glover will receive equity grants, vesting over a three-year period, of 60,000 stock options and 30,000 restricted stock units.
- The Employment Agreement revises the severance payments that Mr. Glover would receive upon termination without Cause or in the case of Constructive Termination, as defined in the Employment Agreement. As revised, such payments would include a lump sum severance payment of an amount equal to his annual salary and an amount sufficient for 12 months of medical insurance coverage.
- The Employment Agreement also revises Mr. Glover's severance payments and benefits upon a Company Transaction, as defined in the Employment Agreement. The revised terms include double-trigger severance payments and benefits if he is terminated without cause or leaves for good reason either two months before or within one year after such a transaction. Such payments and benefits would consist of a lump sum severance payment of an amount equal to his annual salary and his target annual bonus, an amount sufficient for 12 months of medical insurance coverage, acceleration of 100% of his unvested equity, and a 12-month extension of post-termination option exercise rights.
The above description is only a summary of the material terms, does not purport to be a complete description of the Employment Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Agreement, a copy of which will be attached as an exhibit to Blucora's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2013.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BELLEVUE, Wash., May 2, 2013 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Blucora, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCOR) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013.
"Blucora is off to a strong start in 2013 in both the online search and tax preparation segments of the business," said Bill Ruckelshaus, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blucora. "We are especially pleased with the growth of TaxACT and our success in building DDIY market share in a highly-competitive and unpredictable tax season. The TaxACT results reflect the team's strong execution, successful product enhancements this season and our ability to drive consumer demand."
Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
See reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures below.

According to IRS statistics through April 19, total consumer DDIY federal e-files for the tax season were up 1.8 million, or 4 percent compared to the same period last year.
TaxACT professional preparer filings for the tax season grew approximately 10 percent compared to the same period last year. Combined TaxACT offerings assisted approximately 6.5 million filers this tax season.

This announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations due to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general economic, industry, and market sector conditions; the timing and extent of market acceptance of developed products and services and related costs; our dependence on companies to distribute our products and services; the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; future acquisitions; the successful execution of the Company's strategic initiatives, operating plans, and marketing strategies; and the condition of our cash investments. A more detailed description of these and certain other factors that could affect actual results is included in Blucora, Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. Blucora, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blucora defines non-GAAP net income differently for this report than the Company has defined it in the past, due to issuance of the senior convertible notes in March 2013. For this report, Blucora defines non-GAAP net income as net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the effects of loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, accretion of debt discount on convertible notes, gain or loss on derivative instruments, and the related cash tax impact of those adjustments, and non-cash income taxes from continuing operations as detailed in the accompanying table to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited). The Company excludes the non-cash portion of income tax expense because of its ability to offset a substantial portion of its cash tax liabilities by using these deferred tax assets (which consist primarily of U.S. federal net operating losses). The Company's management believes that excluding the non-cash portion of income tax expense from its GAAP net income provides meaningful supplemental information to investors and analysts regarding the Company's performance and the valuation of its business because of its ability to offset a substantial portion of its cash tax liabilities by using these deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets will expire if unutilized in 2020.
Blucora's management believes that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share provide meaningful supplemental information to management, investors and analysts regarding the Company's performance and the valuation of its business by excluding items in the statement of operations that management does not consider part of the Company's ongoing operations or have not been, or are not expected to be, settled in cash. Additionally, Blucora's management believes that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are common measures used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company's performance and the valuation of its business. Non-GAAP net income should be evaluated in light of our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP net income differently, and therefore Blucora's non-GAAP net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
