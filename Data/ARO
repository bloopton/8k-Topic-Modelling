We are optimistic about the prospects for the upcoming holiday season and believe that our merchandise assortment is focused and trend right." Also today, the company announced that its board of directors has authorized a $35 million share repurchase program.

In connection with the recent clarification by the Securities and Exchange Commission of existing accounting literature related to lease accounting, the company is currently in the process of reviewing its lease accounting policies. Based upon a preliminary review, the company anticipates it will be correcting its accounting treatment of the timing of rent expense for its store leases during the pre-opening construction period. The company does not believe this change will be material to the company's results of operations or cash flows for any individual prior or future year, and the company anticipates it will be recording a one time, non-cash rent charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The company is currently working with its independent accounting firm to quantify the impact of the change and expects to complete its review of this matter within the next ten days. The impact of any accounting correction is subject to the company's independent accounting firm's completion of its audit of the company's fiscal 2004 results and review by the company's Audit Committee.

Excluding this one-time adjustment, fourth quarter earnings were $38.1 million or $0.67 per share (see exhibit D), which represents an increase of 42.6%, compared to $0.47 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 20.0% to $327.1 million versus $272.6 million in the comparable period. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 1.9% versus an increase of 8.5% in the same period in the prior year. Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our record fourth quarter results, which once again exceeded expectations, represent a great way to end an excellent year for our company. Our continued focus on gross margin improvement and operating margin expansion enabled us to translate our 20% gain in sales into a significantly higher increase in earnings per share." Net income for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 was $84.1 million or $1.47 per diluted share. Excluding the lease accounting correction, fiscal 2004 earnings were $87.0 million or $1.52 per share (see exhibit D), which represents an increase of 63.4%, compared to $0.93 per diluted share in the prior year. Net sales for fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 increased 31.2% to $964.2 million, compared to net sales of $734.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004. Comparable store sales increased 8.7% for the full year, compared to an increase of 6.6% in the prior year. Mr. Geiger concluded, "Fiscal 2004 was an outstanding period for Aeropostale. We successfully executed our strategic plan and continued to enhance our platform for long-term growth. We also
broadened our brand awareness, delivered great product to our customers, executed our new store openings plan with precision and maintained our competitive edge in the marketplace. Looking forward, we will continue to deliver trend right product at compelling values, to strengthen our operations and to grow our store base by approximately 100 new stores. Our performance in February indicates that we have already experienced a strong start to fiscal 2005 and we are excited about the opportunities in the year ahead and beyond." GUIDANCE: The company announced its earnings guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The company noted it is comfortable with the current First Call consensus estimate of $0.15 per diluted share and expects to achieve a high-single digit increase in comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The first quarter guidance represents an increase of 36.4%, compared to earnings per share of $0.11 in the same period last year. NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES: In June of 2004, the Company acquired the rights to and existing registrations for the JIMMY'Z(R) brand and trademarks in the United States and Canada for clothing and related goods and services. The company anticipates opening an initial group of Jimmy'Z stores in July of this year. Jimmy'Z is a California lifestyle-oriented brand targeting trend-aware, young women and men aged 18-25. During fiscal 2005, the company anticipates opening approximately 14 Jimmy'Z stores in various regions of the United States. The company will also be launching its e-commerce business by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The Aeropostale Web store will be accessible at www.aeropostale.com. LEASE ACCOUNTING POLICIES: In connection with the recent clarification by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of existing accounting literature related to lease accounting, the company has completed a review of its lease accounting policies. As a result of that review, the company has corrected an error and recorded a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax rent charge of $4.7 million ($2.8 million, after tax) in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 related to the timing of rent expense for its store leases during the pre-opening construction period. Previously, the company had followed a prevailing retail industry practice in which it began recording rent expense at the earlier of the time a store opened or the rent payments commenced. The company will now be recording rent expense when it takes possession of a store, or approximately 60 days prior to the store opening. This will result in an acceleration of rent expense during that pre-opening period.
The above-mentioned charge unfavorably impacted net income per share by $0.05 for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2004. The charge was cumulative, and $0.5 million after tax, or $0.01 per share, was related to fiscal 2004, and $2.3 million after tax, or $0.04 per share, was related to prior periods. The company's financial statements for prior periods will not be restated due to the immateriality of this issue to the company's results of operations and statements of financial position and cash flows for the current year or any individual prior year. This correction will not impact historical or future cash flows or timing of payments under related leases and is not expected to have a material impact on future earnings. The company has reviewed these conclusions with their independent auditors and Audit Committee. CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION: The Company will be holding a conference call today at 4:15 P.M. to review its fiscal 2004 fourth quarter results. The broadcast will be available through the `Investor Relations' link at www.aeropostale.com and at www.fulldisclosure.com.

AEROPOSTALE REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2005 RESULTS
 Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of active and casual apparel for the teen market, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 28, 2006.
New York, New York, March 9, 2006
: Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $41.8 million or $0.76 per diluted share, versus net income of $35.3 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 earnings were reduced by $2.8 million or $0.05 per share due to a non-cash expense adjustment related to a correction in the Company's lease accounting policy. Excluding this one time adjustment, pro-forma fourth quarter earnings were $38.1 million or $0.67 per share last year.
FOURTH QUARTER PERFORMANCE
Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 33.1% to $435.2 million versus net sales of $327.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.3% versus an increase of 1.9% last year.
Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased to have ended the fiscal year with such a strong finish. Our ability to respond to the challenges in our business and achieve our short-term objectives in such a timely manner underscores the strength and flexibility of our operating model. We continue to remain focused on executing our merchandise initiatives and look forward to capitalizing on our opportunities during fiscal 2006."
Net income for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 was $84.0 million or $1.50 per diluted share, compared to net income of $84.1 million or $1.47 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. Excluding the lease accounting correction, earnings were $87.0 million or $1.52 per share last year.
FISCAL YEAR PERFORMANCE:
 
Net sales for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 increased 24.9% to $1.204 billion, versus net sales of $964.2 million last year. Comparable store sales increased 3.5% for the full year, compared to an increase of 8.7% last year.
FIRST QUARTER AND FULL YEAR GUIDANCE:
The company announced its earnings guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The company believes it will achieve earnings in the range of $0.14  $0.16 per diluted share, including the negative impact from $0.01 per share for stock option expense and $0.03 per share loss related to Jimmy'Z. For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the company expects comparable store sales equal to or slightly below the same period last year.
The company announced that it expects to achieve full year fiscal 2006 earnings per share growth of approximately 20%, including the negative impact from full year stock option expense of $0.04 per share. Based on the comparable fiscal 2005 pro-forma earnings per share of $1.47, after deducting $0.03 per share of pro forma stock option expense, this earnings per share growth would be approximately 22%.
STORE GROWTH:
The company announced that it intends to open approximately 70-75 Aeropostale stores and up to 5 Jimmy'Z stores during fiscal 2006.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company opened 6 Aeropostale stores and closed 4 Aeropostale stores, ending the year with 657 Aeropostale stores in 47 states. During the same period, the company opened 1 Jimmy'Z store, ending the year with 14 Jimmy'Z stores in 11 states.

The company incurred approximately $58.2 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2005.
CAPITAL SPENDING AND SHARE BUY BACK:
As of January 28, 2006, the company had $41.9 million of repurchase availability under its $150.0 million stock buy back program.

Exhibit 99.1
- Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual and active apparel for young women and men, today announced that total net sales for the four-week period ended July 29, 2006 increased 13.1% to $94.9 million, compared to $83.9 million for the four-week period ended July 30, 2005. The company's comparable store sales decreased 1.9% for the month, versus a comparable store sales decrease of 4.2% in the year ago period.
New York, New York  August 3, 2006
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2006, total net sales have increased 18.0% to $274.6 million, compared to $232.8 million in the year-ago period. Comparable store sales for the second quarter increased 1.0%, versus a comparable store sales decrease of 2.2% in the year-ago period. Fiscal year to date, total net sales have increased 17.2% to $520.9 million, compared to $444.4 million in the year-ago period. Fiscal year to date, comparable store sales decreased 0.9%, versus a comparable store sales increase of 0.9% in the year-ago period.
Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "During July, a month in which we transition from summer into back to school, our men's and accessories businesses performed well and to plan. The business in our women's denim and long bottoms categories, however, performed significantly below our expectations. As a result of this shortfall, we have lowered our view of the second quarter. As we head into the peak back to school selling season, we continue to believe that our merchandise offerings are trend-right, our promotions are compelling and our inventory levels are well controlled."
The company also updated its earnings guidance for the second quarter today. The Company expects second quarter earnings in the range of $0.14  $0.15 per diluted share (which includes $0.02 per diluted share of other income in connection with the settlement of a dispute with a vendor regarding the enforcement of the Company's intellectual property rights) versus its previously issued guidance range of $0.15  $0.17 per diluted share (before recognition of the other income described above). Earnings per diluted share, excluding other income, is expected to be in the range of $0.12  $0.13 per diluted share for the second quarter. The Company believes that the disclosure of the range of diluted earnings per share excluding such other income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors useful information to help them better understand the Company's expected results without the impact of the other income described above.

Exhibit 99.1
 Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of active and casual apparel for the teen market, today reported results for the second quarter ended July 29, 2006.
New York, New York, August 17, 2006
:
SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was $8.4 million, or $0.16 per diluted share (which includes $2.1 million of other income in connection with the resolution of a dispute with a vendor regarding the enforcement of the Company's intellectual property rights). Net income, excluding other income, was $7.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company believes that the disclosure of diluted earnings per share excluding such other income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors useful information to help them better understand the Company's expected results without the impact of the other income described above. The Company had net income of $7.4 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.
The above-mentioned results included net losses from the Company's Jimmy'Z subsidiary of ($0.03) per diluted share for the second quarter of 2006 and ($0.02) for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. In addition, the consolidated results for the second quarter of 2006 included a $0.01 per diluted share charge related to the expensing of stock options.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2006, total net sales increased 18.0% to $274.6 million, compared to $232.8 million in the year-ago period. Comparable store sales for the second quarter increased 1.0%, versus a comparable store sales decrease of 2.2% in the year-ago period. Fiscal year to date, total net sales increased 17.2% to $520.9 million, compared to $444.4 million in the year-ago period. Also fiscal year to date, comparable store sales decreased 0.9%, versus a comparable store sales increase of 0.9% in the year-ago period.
Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "During the second quarter, we believe that we executed our merchandising and planning initiatives consistently and well. While we were able to achieve results in
 
line with our plan for May and June, our sales and margins for the quarter were negatively affected by a significant slowdown in our business in the latter half of July. The trends in our business improved in August, particularly in the early back to school regions, but we are unable to extrapolate this performance to the other regions, which have not yet peaked in their back to school selling season. As a result of this, we believe that it is prudent to adopt a somewhat cautious outlook on our business for the remainder of the third quarter."
THIRD QUARTER GUIDANCE:
The Company announced its earnings guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company believes it will achieve earnings in the range of $0.55  $0.57 per diluted share, including the $0.01 per diluted share charge related to the expensing of stock options.

Our gross margins for the month were in line with our plan, and we ended the month with appropriate levels of inventory. We believe we are well positioned to transition into the spring selling season."
The company also updated its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. The company now believes it will report fourth quarter earnings in the range of $0.98 - $1.00 per diluted share, which includes approximately $6.5 million (net of professional fees) or $0.07 per diluted share, representing a concession by South Bay Apparel, Inc. to the company concerning prior purchases of merchandise.

The company believes that the disclosure of diluted earnings per share excluding such other income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors useful information to help them better understand the company's expected results without the impact of the other income described above.

Exhibit 99.1
- Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual and active apparel for young women and men, today announced that total net sales for the five-week period ended February 3, 2007 increased 41.1% to $90.4 million, from $64.0 million for the four-week period ended January 28, 2006 and increased 13.3% on a pro-forma basis for the comparable five-week period last year. Same store sales for the month increased 5.4%, compared to the corresponding five-week period last year.
New York, New York  February 8, 2007
Total sales for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2007 (14 weeks) increased 16.5% to $506.8 million, from $435.2 million for the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2006 (13 weeks) and increased 12.4% on a pro-forma basis for the comparable fourteen-week period last year. Same store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.2%, compared to the corresponding fourteen-week period last year.
Total net sales for Fiscal 2006 (53 weeks) increased 17.4% to $1.413 billion, from $1.204 billion for Fiscal 2005 (52 weeks) and increased 15.8% on a pro-forma basis for the comparable fifty-three week period last year. Same store sales for Fiscal 2006 increased 2.0%, compared to the corresponding fifty-three week period last year.
Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with our results for January, which exceeded both our sales and gross margin plans. During the month we were able to make significant progress in clearing through our residual holiday merchandise. As a result, we ended the month with less clearance inventory versus last year, we made a seamless transition into the spring selling season and we positioned ourselves well to capitalize on opportunities that were under-funded last spring."
Mr. Geiger concluded, "We are ending the fiscal year on a very positive note and are pleased with the momentum we generated in our business over the last twelve months. We are on track to exceed our targeted earnings growth of 20% this year and are excited about our future prospects. We continue to focus on serving our core teen customers and remaining the dominant promotional specialty store in our space."
The company also updated its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. The company now believes it will report fourth quarter net earnings in the range of $1.06 - $1.07 per diluted share, which includes approximately $7.1 million (net of professional fees) or approximately $0.08 per diluted share, representing a concession by South Bay Apparel, Inc. to the company concerning prior purchases of merchandise. Excluding this vendor concession, the company expects fourth quarter net earnings in the range of $0.98 - $0.99 per diluted share, compared to its previously issued guidance of $0.91 - $0.93 per diluted share, and as compared to net earnings of $0.76 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year, this represents an increase of approximately 29% - 30%, excluding the vendor concession discussed above.
 
The company believes that the disclosure of prior year net sales on a pro-forma basis and diluted earnings per share excluding the other income relating to the vendor concession, which are both non-GAAP financial measures, provides investors useful information to help them better understand the company's expected results.

Exhibit 99.1

Same store sales for the month decreased 14.0%, compared to the corresponding four-week period ended May 6, 2006.
New York, New York  May 10, 2007
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, total net sales have increased 12.0% to $275.8 million, from $246.3 million in the year-ago period. Same store sales for the first quarter have increased 2.5%, compared to the corresponding period ended May 6, 2006.

Accordingly, we were able to maintain the positive trend in our gross margins and we are on track to end the quarter with earnings above our previously issued guidance. We also remain well positioned for a smooth transition into the summer selling season."
Based on the positive trend in gross margins for the month, the company updated guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The company now expects net earnings in the range of $0.24-$0.25 per diluted share, versus its previously issued guidance of $0.22-$0.23 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter last year.
The company believes that the disclosure of sales on a pro-forma basis due to the 53 week in fiscal 2006, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors useful information to help them better understand the company's expected results.

Exhibit 99.1
 Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of active and casual apparel for young men and women, today reported results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2007.
New York, New York, May 24, 2007
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $13.8 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, an increase of 73.3% compared to net income of $8.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, total net sales increased 12.0% to $275.8 million, from $246.3 million in the year-ago period. Same store sales for the first quarter increased 2.5%, compared to the corresponding 13 weeks ended May 6, 2006.
Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with our performance for the first quarter, the results of which significantly exceeded our expectations. Our balanced and trend-right merchandise assortments are continuing to be received positively by our customers. Our accomplishments for the quarter also reflect improvements we have made in our planning process and in our inventory management. As a result of the consistent execution of our strategic initiatives, we achieved strong increases in our gross margins and we ended the quarter with record earnings. We are thrilled with the momentum of our business and look forward to exciting summer and back to school selling seasons."
Second Quarter Guidance
The Company announced its earnings guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company believes it will achieve earnings in the range $0.26 to $0.28 per diluted share. Based on the calendar year shift, which includes the acceleration of the back to school selling season, this guidance reflects an estimated shift of $0.04 to $0.06 earnings per share to the second quarter from the third quarter. This compares to net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of $8.4 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, (which included $2.1 million of other income in connection with the resolution of a dispute with a vendor regarding the enforcement of the Company's intellectual property rights). Net income, excluding other income, was $7.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
 
The Company believes that the disclosure of sales on a pro-forma basis due to the 53 week in fiscal 2006 and reporting diluted earnings per share which excluded other income in fiscal 2006, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, provides investors useful information to help them better understand the Company's expected results without the impact of the two items described above.

ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
New Credit Facility
      Aeropostale, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility which expanded its availability from a maximum of $75 million to $150 million, dated as of November 13, 2007, with Bank of America, N.A., as Lender (the "New Credit Facility").     
       The New Credit Facility provides for a $150 million revolving credit line. The new credit Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of the Company's capital stock and for its capital expenditures. The New Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on November 13, 2012 and is guarantied by all of the domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the "Guarantors").
       Loans under the New Credit Facility are secured by all of the assets of the Company and are guaranteed by subsidiaries of the Company. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Dominion Event (as defined in the New Credit Facility) among other limitations, the Company's ability to borrow funds, make investments, pay dividends and repurchase shares of its common stock would be limited.      
     The New Credit Facility replaces a maximum $75 million Loan and Security Agreement dated October 7, 2003, as amended by the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement dated as of June 16, 2006, and the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement dated as of May 21, 2007, by and between the Company and Bank of America, as agent for the lenders party thereto (the "Prior Credit Facility"). The Prior Credit Facility, which was scheduled to expire in April 2010, was terminated concurrently with the entering into the New Credit Facility.      
     Except for the use of a portion of the credit under the New Loan Facility to fund the Company's repurchase of shares as described below, as of the date hereof, the Company has no direct borrowings outstanding under the New Credit Facility. Direct borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest at a margin over either LIBOR or a Base Rate (as each such term is defined in the New Credit Facility).
     The New Credit Facility also contains covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, restrict the Company's ability to, among other things:
     Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the New Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
     The foregoing description of the New Credit Facility and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Share Repurchase Program
     The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a $250 million increase in the Company's share repurchase program bringing the total share repurchase program authorized to date to $600 million. The Company will use a portion of the authorization to immediately execute an accelerated share repurchase program ("ASR") to repurchase $125 million of its common shares. On November 13, 2007, the Company entered into a confirmation agreement with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"). A portion of the availability under the New Credit Facility, described above, will be used to fund the ASR.      
     Bank of America is expected to purchase shares of the Company in the open market in connection with the ASR over a period not to exceed three months. The final number of shares to be repurchased from Bank of America under
Table of Contents
the ASR will be determined at the conclusion of the transaction, based upon the volume weighted average share price of the Company's common shares during the term of the ASR. The ASR is subject to collar provisions that establish the minimum and maximum price for the shares, which will in turn determine the final number of shares being repurchased under the ASR.
     Pursuant to the ASR, Bank of America is expected to purchase shares of the Company's common stock in the open market during a period not to exceed three months. The initial price of the shares purchased by the Company from Bank of America is subject to a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of the shares during this period.      
     The foregoing description of the ASR and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the ASR agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
     
ITEM 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
     The disclosure required by this item is included in "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement," which is incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     The disclosure required by this item is included in "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement," which is incorporated herein by reference.

          (iii) All credits against the Liabilities shall be conditional upon final payment to the Lender of the items giving rise to such credits. The amount of any item credited against the Liabilities which is charged back against the Lender for any reason or is not so paid shall be a Liability and shall be added to the Loan Account, whether or not the item so charged back or not so paid is returned.
          (iv) Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees, service charges, costs, and expenses for which the Borrower is obligated hereunder are payable on demand.
          (v) The Lender, without the request of the Borrower, may advance under the Revolving Credit any interest, fee, service charge, or other payment to which the Lender is entitled from the Borrower pursuant hereto and may charge the same to the Loan Account notwithstanding that such amount so advanced may result in Availability's being exceeded.

          (vi) Absent manifest error, any statement rendered by the Lender to the Borrower concerning the Liabilities shall be considered correct and accepted by the Borrower and shall be conclusively binding upon the Borrower unless the Borrower provides the Lender with written objection thereto within sixty (60) days from the receipt of such statement, which written objection shall indicate, with particularity, the reason for such objection. The Loan Account and the Lender's books and records concerning the loan arrangement contemplated herein and the Liabilities shall be prima facie evidence and proof of the items described therein.

          (vii) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.

Such deposit shall be held by the Lender as collateral for the payment and performance of the Liabilities. The Lender shall have the exclusive dominion and control over such account. Such deposits shall not bear interest. Monies in such account shall be automatically applied by the Lender to reimburse the Issuer for any honoring of any L/Cs, together with any other amounts owed to the Issuer, and after all L/Cs have been so reimbursed or otherwise expired, any remaining balance shall be applied in reduction of the Liabilities.

Drawings under such "back-to-back" letters of credit shall be applied by the Lender to the Liabilities in the manner set forth above with respect to the cash collateral account.

          (A) The performance by any beneficiary under any L/C of that beneficiary's obligations to the Borrower.
          (B) The form, sufficiency, correctness, genuineness, authority of any person signing; falsification; or the legal effect of; any documents called for under any L/C if (with respect to the foregoing) such documents on their face appear to be in order, except to the extent that such Issuer, Issuer's correspondents, or advising, negotiating, or paying bank has actual knowledge of any of the foregoing.
          (ii) The Issuer may honor, as complying with the terms of any L/C and of any drawing thereunder, any drafts or other documents otherwise in order, but signed or issued by an administrator, executor, conservator, trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver, or other legal representative of the party authorized under such L/C to draw or issue such drafts or other documents.
 
          (iii) Unless otherwise agreed to, in the particular instance, the Borrower hereby authorizes any Issuer to:

The Issuer shall have discharged the Issuer's obligations under any L/C which, or the drawing under which, includes payment instructions, by the initiation of the method of payment called for in, and in accordance with, such instructions (or by any other commercially reasonable and comparable method). Neither the Lender nor the Issuer shall have any responsibility for any inaccuracy, interruption, error, or delay in transmission or delivery by post, telegraph or cable, or for any inaccuracy of translation, except for their gross negligence or willful misconduct.
          (v) The Lender's, and the Issuer's rights, powers, privileges and immunities specified in or arising under this Agreement are in addition to any heretofore or at any time hereafter otherwise created or arising, whether by statute or rule of law or contract.
          (vi) Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided hereunder or agreed to in writing by the Issuer and the Borrower, (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby L/C, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial L/C.
          (vii) If any change in any law, executive order or regulation, or any directive of any administrative or governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), or in the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or governmental authority charged with the administration thereof, shall either:
          (A) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements against letters of credit heretofore or hereafter issued by any Issuer or with respect to which the Lender, any or any Issuer has an obligation to lend to fund drawings under any L/C; or
          (B) impose on any Issuer any other condition or requirements relating to any such letters of credit;
and the result of any event referred to in Section 2-20(g)(i) or 2-20(g)(ii), above, shall be to increase the cost to any Issuer of issuing or maintaining any L/C (which increase in cost shall be the result of such Issuer's reasonable allocation among that Issuer's letter of credit customers of the aggregate of such cost increases resulting from such events), then, upon demand by the Lender and delivery by the Lender to the Borrower of a certificate of an officer of the subject Issuer describing such change in law, executive order, regulation, directive, or interpretation thereof, its effect on such Issuer, and the basis for determining such increased costs and their allocation, the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Lender, from time to time as specified by the Lender, such amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Issuer for such increased cost; the Borrower shall not be obligated to make payment of such amounts which arise from transactions which occurred more than ninety (90) Business Days prior to the Lender's furnishing notice hereunder. Any Issuer's determination of costs incurred under Section 2-20(g)(i) or 2-20(g)(ii), above, and the allocation, if any, of such costs among the Borrower and other letter of credit customers of such Issuer, if done in good faith and made on
provided that
 
an equitable basis and in accordance with such officer's certificate, shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower, absent manifest error.
          (viii) The obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect to L/C's are absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms hereof under all circumstances, whatsoever including, without limitation, the following:
          (A) Any lack of validity or enforceability or restriction, restraint, or stay in the enforcement of this Agreement, any L/C, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto.

          (A) The Lender shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be final and conclusive) on any day on which the rate for a Eurodollar Loan would otherwise be set, that adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining such rate.
          (B) The Lender shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be final and conclusive) that:
          (1) The continuation of or conversion of any Revolving Credit Loan to a Eurodollar Loan has been made impracticable or unlawful by the occurrence of a contingency that materially and adversely affects the applicable market or compliance by the Lender in good faith with any applicable law or governmental regulation, guideline or order or interpretation or change thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or with any request or directive of any such governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law).
          (2) The indices on which the interest rates for Eurodollar Loans are based shall no longer represent the effective cost to the Lender for U.S. dollar deposits in the interbank market for deposits in which it regularly participates.

If there is adopted after the date hereof any requirement of law, or if there is any new interpretation or application of any law after the date hereof by any court or by any governmental or other authority or entity charged with the administration thereof, whether or not having the force of law, which:
     I. subjects the Lender to any taxes or changes the basis of taxation, or increases any existing taxes, on payments of principal, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lender under this Agreement (except for taxes on the Lender's overall net income or capital imposed by the jurisdiction in which the Lender's principal or lending offices are located or in which the Lender is organized);

     IV. imposes on the Lender a requirement to maintain or allocate capital in relation to the Liabilities;
and the result of any of the foregoing, in the Lender's reasonable opinion, is to increase the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining any loan, advance or financial accommodation or to reduce the income receivable by the Lender in respect of any loan, advance or financial accommodation by an amount which the Lender deems to be material, then upon the Lender's giving written notice thereof to the Borrower (such notice to set out in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to and a summary calculation of such increased cost or reduced income), the Borrower shall forthwith pay to the Lender, upon receipt of such notice, that amount which shall compensate the Lender for such additional cost or reduction in income, the Borrower shall not be obligated to make payment of such amounts which arise from transactions which occurred more than ninety (90) Business Days prior to the Lender's furnishing notice hereunder.
provided that
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lender agrees to use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions and so long as such efforts would not be disadvantageous to it, in its reasonable discretion, in any legal, economic or regulatory manner) to designate a different lending office if the making of such designation would allow the Lender or its lending office to avoid the imposition of such increased costs.
     (w) Lender's Commitments.
          (i) The Dollar Commitments, Commitment Percentages, and identities of the Lenders (but not the overall Commitment) may be changed, from time to time by the assignment of Dollar Commitments and Commitment Percentages with other Persons who determine to become "Lenders", provided, however, that
          (A) Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (in which event, no consent of the Borrower is required) any assignment (other than an assignment to a then Lender) shall be subject to the prior consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld), which consent will be deemed given unless the Borrower provides the Lender with written objection, not more than five (5) Business Days after the Lender shall have given the Borrower written notice of a proposed assignment).
 
          (B) Any such assignment or reallocation shall be on a pro-rata basis such that each reallocated or assigned Dollar Commitment to any Person remains the same percentage of the overall Commitment (in terms of dollars) as the reallocated Commitment Percentage is to such Person.
          (C) No such assignment shall be in an amount less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or, if less, the total Dollar Commitment of such assigning Lender.
          (ii) Upon written notice given the Borrower from time to time by the Lender, of any assignment or allocation referenced in Section 2-23(a):
          (A) The Borrower shall execute replacement one or more Revolving Credit Notes to reflect such changed Dollar Commitments, Commitment Percentages, and identities and shall deliver such replacement Revolving Credit Notes to the Lender (which promptly thereafter shall deliver to the Borrower the Revolving Credit Notes so replaced) provided however, in the event that a Revolving Credit Note is to be exchanged following its acceleration or the entry of an order for relief under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower, the Lender, in lieu of causing the Borrower to execute one or more new Revolving Credit Notes, may issue the Lender's Certificate confirming the resulting Commitments and Commitment Percentages.
          (B) Such change shall be effective from the effective date specified in such written notice and any Person added as a Lender shall have all rights and privileges of a Lender hereunder thereafter as if such Person had been a signatory to this Agreement and any other Loan Document to which a Lender is a signatory and any person removed as a Lender shall be relieved of any obligations or responsibilities of a Lender hereunder thereafter.

Exhibit 99.1
- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual and active apparel for young women and men, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a $250 million increase in the Company's share repurchase program bringing the total share repurchase program authorization since inception of the program to $600 million. Under an agreement with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), the Company will use a portion of this authorization to implement an accelerated share repurchase program ("ASR") to repurchase $125 million of its common shares. The shares repurchased by the Company from Bank of America are expected to be held as treasury shares.
New York, New York  November 13, 2007
Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are committed to maximizing shareholder value, and our share repurchase program is an important aspect of our efforts. The repurchase of our common stock at current price levels represents an attractive use of our capital, and reflects our confidence in the long-term potential of our business."
Bank of America is expected to purchase shares of the Company in the open market in connection with the ASR over a period not to exceed three months. The final number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR will be determined at the conclusion of the transaction, based upon the volume weighted average share price of the Company's common shares during the term of the ASR. The ASR is subject to collar provisions that establish the minimum and maximum price for the shares, which will in turn determine the final number of shares being repurchased under the ASR.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, and separate and apart from the ASR program, the Company repurchased approximately $125 million, or 6.3 million shares of common stock, bringing the total dollar amount of shares repurchased under its share repurchase program to $341 million or 18.4 million shares of common stock. With the latest increase in repurchase authorization, and after taking into account the $125 million ASR, total Company share repurchases since inception of the program are $466 million. Accordingly, the Company has approximately $134 million remaining under the Company's share repurchase program.
Additionally, the Company also announced today that it has entered into a Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America (the "Loan Agreement"), which expands the credit facility with Bank of America from a maximum of $75 million to now $150 million. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties covenants, terms and conditions for an agreement of this nature. Aropostale plans to fund the ASR and any open market purchases under the Company's share repurchase program through its existing cash balances as well as through the credit facility under the Loan Agreement, as needed.

Exhibit 99.1
      Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of active and casual apparel for young men and women, today reported results for the third quarter ended November 3, 2007.
New York, New York, November 28, 2007
     Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased with our results for the quarter, which exceeded expectations. During the quarter we were able to drive consistent comparable store sales increases, while continuing to improve our gross margins over last year. We also ended the quarter with well controlled inventories."
     Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $36.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to net income of $32.6 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
     For the third quarter of fiscal 2007, total net sales increased 7.0% to $412.6 million, from $385.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. For the third quarter, same store sales increased 1.9% compared to the corresponding period ended November 4, 2006. Year-to-date, total net sales increased 10.3% to $999.6 million, from $906.4 million in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, same store sales increased 0.1% compared to the corresponding period ended November 4, 2006.
     In addition to the Company's accelerated share repurchase program, which the Company announced on November 13, 2007, the Company also repurchased approximately $125.1 million, or 6.3 million shares of common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
Fourth Quarter Guidance
     The Company also announced its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company believes it will achieve fourth quarter earnings in the range $0.82 to $0.84 per diluted share, including an approximate $0.08 positive impact from the accelerated share repurchase of $125.0 million, in addition to the share repurchases of $125.1 million, or 6.3 million shares made in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Based on fourth quarter earnings per share guidance, the Company expects to achieve full year fiscal 2007 earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.62 per diluted share. With this guidance, the company is poised to significantly exceed its objective of annual earnings per share growth of approximately 20% for fiscal 2007.
     Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, continued, "The sales and margin momentum from our strong third quarter has carried over into our initial performance in the fourth quarter. Over the important Friday and Saturday following Thanksgiving Day, we achieved mid-single digit comparable store sales increases compared to a mid-single digit increase last year. We currently expect our November comparable store sales to increase in the mid-single digits range. The reaction to our holiday merchandise assortment has been positive and we remain focused on executing our strategies for the peak holiday selling season."
 
     The Company believes that the disclosure of sales on a pro-forma basis due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2006, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors useful information to help them better understand the Company's results.

     (e) On January 30, 2008, we entered into a new employment agreement, effective February 1, 2008, with Julian R. Geiger, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors. This employment agreement replaces an earlier employment agreement with Mr. Geiger.
     Under the new employment agreement, Mr. Geiger's Employment Period as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors extends to January 31, 2011 unless Mr. Geiger elects, at any time after February 1, 2009, to terminate his Employment Period and commence an Advisory Period, which would extend until January 31, 2011. Both the Employment Period and the Advisory Period maybe be earlier terminated pursuant to the terms to the new agreement by us for cause, or without cause, by Mr. Geiger for good reason, or without good reason, and by death or disability.
     Upon execution of the new agreement, Mr. Geiger was granted 186,000 restricted shares of our common stock vesting on the earlier of February 1, 2009 or the termination of the new agreement for any reason, except by Mr. Geiger without good reason. We will pay to Mr. Geiger a base salary of $1 million per annum each fiscal year during the Employment Period, subject to increase by the Compensation Committee of our Board. In addition, for each fiscal year during his Employment Period, Mr. Geiger will receive a cash bonus based upon earnings per share and operating income criteria established by the Compensation Committee of the Board for such fiscal year. This bonus is capped at 300% of Mr. Geiger's base salary. In addition, on the first day of the month of the Employment Period, commencing February 1, 2009, we will pay to Mr. Geiger in cash an amount equal to one- twelfth of the value, on February 1, 2008, of the Stock Grant. The new employment agreement also provides for accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted shares of common stock granted to Mr. Geiger prior to February 1, 2008. In addition, we will pay to Mr. Geiger monthly, during the Employment Period, commencing on February 27, 2009, $233,000 per month. Furthermore, upon retirement and/or termination of the new agreement under certain circumstances, we will pay to him all benefits that he is entitled to under the SERP in a single lump sum in cash.
     If Mr. Geiger terminates his Employment Period after February 1, 2009 and before January 31, 2011, the Advisory Period will begin and extend to January 31, 2011. During the Advisory Period, Mr. Geiger will serve as a part-time advisor and consultant to us and continue to serve as the Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. Geiger's services during the Advisory Period will be rendered at mutually agreed times and locations and the amount of time requested by us for such services must be reasonable. During the Advisory Period, we will pay Mr. Geiger an advisory fee of $250,000 per annum and grant to him restricted shares in a minimum 20,000 and maximum of 40,000 such shares for each fiscal year during the Advisory Period, depending upon performance levels for the Company established by the Compensation Committee for each such fiscal year. The Advisory Period maybe be terminated by us or by Mr. Geiger for substantially the same reasons as apply to the termination of the Employment Period.
     The new agreement contains non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that apply during its term and also contains indemnification provisions customary in executive employment agreements with Delaware corporations.

The Executive agrees during the Employment Period to perform to the best of the Executive's ability, experience and talent those acts and duties and to furnish those services to the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with and related to such positions as the Board shall from time to time direct, provided such acts and directives are consistent with the duties of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.

In no event shall the aggregate Bonus for any Fiscal Year exceed 300% of the Base Salary for such Fiscal Year. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (B) below, the Company shall pay the Bonus to the Executive as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 30 days following the Company's receipt of its audited financial statements for such Fiscal Year.

Dated: March 14, 2008

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of active and casual apparel for young men and women, today reported results for the fourth quarter (fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 consisted of 13 weeks compared to fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 which consisted of 14 weeks) and fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 (fiscal 2007 consisted of 52 weeks compared to fiscal 2006 which consisted of 53 weeks).
New York, New York, March 13, 2008
Julian R. Geiger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and with our strong finish to the year. Our consistency throughout the year helped drive our record financial performance in fiscal 2007. A balanced merchandise assortment, combined with a focus on maintaining the right promotional cadence, enabled us to improve our merchandise margins significantly. Additionally, we successfully executed our key growth initiatives, including improving our planning process and strengthening our management team."
Total net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 16.7% to $591.3 million, from $506.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Same store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 9.2%, compared to the corresponding 13-week period last year. Total net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 included initial gift-card breakage estimates, as a result of the Company relieving its legal obligation to escheat unredeemed gift-cards. This estimate was not included in the Company's previously reported net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
Fourth Quarter Performance
:
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $64.7 million, or $0.95 per diluted share. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 reflected the following special items:
Excluding the special items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $63.0 million, or $0.93 per share (see Exhibit D). This compares to the Company's previously issued guidance of $0.87 per share, which had included neither the aforementioned special items, nor the additional benefit of $2.1 million, or $0.03 per share, related to a reduction in the effective tax rate primarily due to favorable state tax accrual adjustments.
Total net sales for fiscal 2007 increased 12.6% to $1.591 billion, from $1.413 billion for fiscal 2006. Same store sales for fiscal 2007 increased 3.3%, compared to the corresponding 52-week period last year. Total net sales for fiscal 2007 included the aforementioned initial gift-card breakage estimates recorded in
Full Fiscal Year Performance:
 
the fourth quarter. This estimate was not included in the Company's previously reported net sales for fiscal 2007.
Net income for fiscal 2007 was $129.2 million, or $1.73 per diluted share. Excluding the aforementioned special items, adjusted net income for fiscal 2007 was $127.5 million, or $1.70 per share (see Exhibit D). This amount also includes a benefit of $1.7 million, or $0.03 per share, related to the aforementioned reduction in the Company's effective tax rate.
The Company ended fiscal 2007 with no debt and with $111.9 million in cash and cash-equivalents. The Company believes that the disclosure of diluted earnings per share excluding the special items described above, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with useful information to help them better understand the Company's results (see Exhibit D).
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company executed an accelerated share repurchase of $125.0 million or 4.8 million shares of its common stock, bringing the total shares repurchased under the program during fiscal 2007 to $266.5 million or 11.7 million shares. The Company currently has approximately $134.0 million remaining under the share repurchase program.
Share Repurchase Program
For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company expects net earnings in the range of $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.18 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. For the full year, the Company expects to achieve earnings per share growth of approximately 18%, compared to fiscal 2007 pro-forma net earnings of $1.70 per share (Exhibit D).
First Quarter And Full Year Guidance
Mr. Geiger concluded, "In fiscal 2008, we are well positioned to continue building on our significant accomplishments from last year. We remain very pleased with the customer reaction to our merchandise assortment for the spring selling season. We look forward to the continued expansion of our brand within the United States and Canada, while exploring new growth opportunities. We are proud of the achievements we have made in our business and we look forward to the opportunities ahead for Aropostale."
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 the Company opened 5 Aropostale stores, ending the year with 814 Aropostale stores in 47 states and Canada and 14 Jimmy'Z stores in 11 states. The Company intends to open approximately 85 Aropostale stores during fiscal 2008.
Store Growth and Capital Spending
The Company plans to invest approximately $76.0 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 to open 85 additional Aropostale stores under the Company's new store format, remodel certain existing stores under the new store format and make certain information technology investments.
The Company also announced today that it will be developing a new concept that will build on the Company's core competencies, while targeting a younger demographic than the Aropostale customer. The Company intends a controlled launch during fiscal 2009. The cost impact has been considered in the Company's guidance for fiscal 2008.
Development of New Concept
 
The Company will be holding a conference call today at 4:15 P.M. EST to review its fourth quarter and full fiscal 2007 financial results.

New York, New York, December 3, 2008
Third Quarter Results
Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 31% to a record $0.63 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $0.48 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2007.

Year to date total net sales have increased 17% to $1.396 billion, from $1.192 billion in the year ago period. Year to date same store sales increased 7%, compared to essentially flat same store sales last year.
Fourth Quarter Guidance
The Company announced its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.  The Company expects earnings in the range of $0.84 to $0.90 per diluted share for the fourth quarter.
The Company achieved diluted earnings per share of $0.95 in the fourth quarter last year. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 reflected certain special items (Exhibit D). Excluding these special items, diluted earnings per share were $0.93 for the fourth quarter of 2007.  The Company believes that the disclosure of diluted earnings per share excluding the special items, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with useful information to help them better understand the Companys results.
Mr. Geiger concluded, As we progress through the holiday selling season, we will continue to offer our customers the right fashion at compelling values. We believe that the fundamentals of our business, which are responsible for our record year -to-date results, remain strong.  We are focused on managing the business conservatively while maximizing growth opportunities and continuing to deliver profitable performance.
Capital Expenditures
The Company expects fiscal 2009 capital expenditures of approximately $55 million, which relate to new and remodeled stores, corporate projects and IT initiatives.   The Company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $80 million for fiscal 2008

- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual and active apparel for young women and men, today announced that it will close its JimmyZ concept, including its 11 JimmyZ stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
New York, New York  February 23, 2009
 
The decision to take this action resulted from a comprehensive review and evaluation of the current macro-economic condition and the performance of the concept. Company management determined that discontinuing the business would enable the organization to focus on the growth within the core Aropostale business and the roll out of the Companys next U.S. retail concept which will target a younger demographic.
 
Julian R. Geiger said, We sincerely thank everyone in the JimmyZ organization for their hard work, commitment and dedication to the brand over the past few years. We believe, however, that discontinuing the JimmyZ concept will enable us to focus on businesses which align with our core competencies, and generate greater long-term shareholder value.
 
During the first half of fiscal 2009, the Company expects to incur approximately $5.0 million of additional pre-tax costs related to lease terminations, inventory liquidation, and employee retention and severance obligations. The Company expects an on-going financial benefit from the elimination of JimmyZ annualized operating losses of approximately $8.0 million pre-tax or $0.07 per share.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 3.1
      . The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware shall be located at 1013 Centre Road, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle. The name of the Corporation's registered agent at such address shall be The Prentice Hall Corporation Service Company. The registered office and/or registered agent of the Corporation may be changed from time to time by action of the Board of Directions,
Section 1.
Registered Office
      . The Corporation may also have offices at such other places, both within and without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may require.
Section 2.
Other Offices
      . An annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held each year within 150 days after the close of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the Corporation or at such other time specified by the Board of Directors for the purpose of electing directors and conducting such proper business as may properly be brought before the annual meeting pursuant to Section 11 of this ARTICLE II.
Section 1.
Annual Meeting
      . Special meetings of the stockholders may only be called in the manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting and proxy statement.
Section 2.
Special Meetings
     In the event that a special meeting of stockholders is called pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 2 for the purpose of filling any vacancy or newly created directorship, and only in such event, a stockholder may nominate persons for election to such vacancy or newly created directorship (but only with respect to directorships specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting and proxy statement for such special meeting), if such stockholder (i) was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in these By-laws and at the time of the
 
special meeting, (ii) is entitled to vote for the director(s) to be elected at such meeting and (iii) complies with the notice procedures set forth below in this Section 2. For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations before a special meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a stockholder who otherwise complies with this Section 2 shall be entitled to nominate persons for election at a special meeting only with respect to director positions to be elected at such meeting for which such stockholder is entitled to vote at such meeting.
     Any such nominations by a stockholder shall be made only pursuant to timely notice in proper form in writing to the secretary of the Corporation.
     To be timely, a stockholder's notice of a director nomination for a special meeting must be received by the secretary at the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth calendar day following the date that public notice is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

     To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice of a director nomination shall set forth the information specified in Article III, Sections 6 and 8.
     Notwithstanding anything in the By-laws to the contrary, no business, including the election of directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships, shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that any business proposed, including any nomination of persons for election as directors, was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the By-laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be considered.
     For avoidance of doubt, nothing in these By-laws shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

The officer having charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall make, at least 10 days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
Section 5.
Stockholders List
      . The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or by the Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 7.
Adjourned Meeting
      . When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless (i) by express provisions of an applicable law or of the Certificate of Incorporation a different vote is required, in which case
Section 8.
Vote Required
 
such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question, or (ii) the subject matter is the election of Directors, in which case Section 2 of Article III hereof shall govern and control the approval of such subject matter.
      . Except as otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or any amendments thereto or these By-laws, every stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
Section 9.
Voting Rights
      . Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed or transmitted proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. Any proxy is suspended when the person executing or transmitting the proxy is present at a meeting of stockholders and elects to vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest and the fact of the interest appears on the face of the proxy, the agent named in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights referred to in the proxy, notwithstanding the presence of the person executing the proxy. At each meeting of the stockholders, and before any voting commences, all proxies filed at or before the meeting shall be submitted to and examined by the secretary or a person designated by the secretary, and no shares may be represented or voted under a proxy that has been found to be invalid or irregular. Any transmission may be by telecopy, electronic mail or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission; provided, however, that any transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that such transmission was authorized by such stockholder.
Section 10.
Proxies
      . At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business (other than the election of directors) shall be conducted and only such proposals (other than the nomination of persons for election of directors as provided in Article III, Section 5), shall be acted upon, as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business (other than the election of directors) must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder who (i) was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in these By-laws and at the time of the annual meeting, (ii) is entitled to vote with respect to such business at the meeting and (iii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in these By-laws as to such business. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (c) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to propose business (other than business included in the Corporation's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act) before an annual meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a stockholder who otherwise complies
Section 11.
Business Brought Before an Annual Meeting
 
with this Section 11 shall be entitled to propose business at an annual meeting only with respect to matters for which such stockholder is entitled to vote at such meeting.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice with respect to an annual meeting must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not earlier than 120 calendar days nor later than the close of business on the 90 calendar day in advance of the anniversary of the date of the most recent preceding annual meeting of stockholders, except that, subject to the next paragraph, if the date of the annual meeting for a year has been changed by more than 30 calendar days before or after the anniversary date of the most recent preceding annual meeting, a stockholder proposal shall be timely if it is received by the Corporation not earlier than 120 calendar days nor later than the close of business on the 90 calendar day in advance of the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public notice of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior the date of such annual meeting, not later than the close of business on the tenth calendar day following the date of public notice of the date of the annual meeting for such year. Delivery of any notice required by this Section 11 shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

Section 1.

Subject to any rights of the holders of any series of preferred Stock to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances, the number of Directors which shall constitute the Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of Directors then in office. The Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election of Directors; provided that, whenever the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation are entitled to elect one or more Directors pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (including, but not limited to, for purposes of these By-laws, pursuant to any duly authorized certificate of designation), such Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of such class or series present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election of such Directors.

Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this By-law and at the time of the annual meeting, who is entitled to vote for the election of Directors to be elected at the meeting and who shall have complied with the notice procedures set forth below in Section 5(b) and Section 6 of Article III. For avoidance of doubt, clause (a)(ii)
 
above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations for the election of Directors at an annual meeting of stockholders.
          (b) In order for a stockholder to nominate a person for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting of stockholders, such stockholder shall have delivered timely notice in proper form of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination in writing to the secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting for a year has been changed by more than 30 calendar days before or after the anniversary date of the most recent preceding annual meeting, a nomination shall be timely if it is received by the Corporation not earlier than 120 calendar days nor later than the close of business on the 90 calendar day in advance of the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public notice of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, not later than the close of business on the tenth calendar day following the date of public notice of the date of the annual meeting for such year.

          (b) During an emergency, special meetings of the Board of Directors and of any committee thereof may be called by the chairman of the board or the president. Notice of any special or regular meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee need be given only to those Directors whom it is practical to reach, may be given in any practical manner and may call a meeting at any time following the notice, including immediately after the notice.
          (c) The Directors or sole Director in attendance or otherwise participating at a meeting during an emergency shall constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors. Such Directors or sole Director may temporarily reassign duties and responsibilities of officers, relocate offices, and authorize officers to take emergency actions. Any action taken at a meeting by majority vote of the Directors or the sole Director in attendance or otherwise participating shall be the action of the Board of Directors.
          (d) If a quorum of any committee is not in attendance or otherwise participating at a meeting of such committee called during an emergency, any action of such committee may be taken by a majority of the Directors or the sole Director in attendance or participating in a meeting during such emergency. Alternatively, a majority or such Directors or the sole Director may temporarily redesignate the membership of committees to serve during the emergency.
 
          (e) Corporate action taken in good faith during an emergency under this section to further the business affairs of the Corporation shall bind the Corporation and may not be used to impose liability on a Director, officer, employee or agent.

AROPOSTALE REPORTS RESULTS FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2010
 
Fourth Quarter Earnings of $0.95 Per Share,
Including $0.03 Per Share Unfavorable Impact Due to Higher Effective Tax Rate
Provides First Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2011 Guidance
-- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010, as well as provided guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2011.
New York, New York, March 10, 2011
Fourth Quarter Performance
Diluted net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $0.95 per diluted share, including $0.03 per share unfavorable impact due to a higher than expected effective tax rate. The Company reported net earnings of $0.99 per diluted share in the fourth quarter last year.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, net sales increased 5% to $839.3 million, from $801.2 million in the year ago period. Same store sales for the fourth quarter decreased 3%, compared to a same store sales increase of 9% last year. 
Full Fiscal Year Performance
Diluted net earnings for fiscal 2010 were $2.49 per share, including the aforementioned $0.03 per share impact due to a higher than expected effective tax rate and a previously disclosed after tax charge of $0.04 per diluted share resulting from the third quarter retirement plan payment to the Companys Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer. The Company reported net earnings of $2.27 per share in the same period last year.
Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 8% to $2.400 billion, from $2.230 billion in the year ago period. Same store sales for fiscal 2010 increased 1%, compared to a same store sales increase of 10% last year.
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, In 2010 the Aropostale brand continued to build momentum and popularity, we opened our flagship Times Square store, and we continued the roll-out of our childrens concept P.S. from Aropostale. While we are proud of our many accomplishments, our performance in the back-half was below our expectations. The teen retail environment was highly promotional and we believe that we did not execute to our full potential. Moving into 2011, we recognize our opportunities and are more determined than ever to show the power of the Aropostale brand.
First Quarter and Full Year 2011 Guidance
For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company expects earnings in the range of $0.35 to $0.38 per share, compared to earnings of $0.48 per share last year. For the full year, the Company expects net earnings in the range of $2.20 to $2.40 per diluted share.
Mr. Johnson, continued, Our outlook for the first quarter reflects the impact from clearing through holiday inventories, and our outlook for the full year reflects industry wide inflationary pressures. As we look forward into 2011, we recognize that the entire sector faces near term challenges. We are, however, focused on leveraging our flexible promotional business model to navigate through the current environment and delivering on our initiatives to position ourselves for future growth.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
- Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today announced updated expectations for the first quarter.
NEW YORK, May 5, 2011
For the first quarter of fiscal 2011 net sales increased 1% to $469.2 million, from $463.6 million in the year ago period. Same store sales for the first quarter decreased 7%, compared to a same store sales increase of 8% last year.
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Clearly we are not satisfied with our sales and margin performance for the first quarter. We were more promotional than anticipated on our spring assortment and clearance merchandise. Additionally, our core customers continue to be pressured by challenging macroeconomic conditions while, at the same time, the teen retail sector remains intensely promotional. As we move forward through the year, our entire management team is keenly focused on our key initiatives: regaining the balance and clarity of our merchandise assortment, managing our cost structure, and leveraging our strong financial position. We remain very confident in our business model, in the ability and determination of our organization, and in the strength and positioning of our brand."
Based on the lower than expected sales and margins for the quarter the Company now expects first quarter earnings of approximately $0.20 per diluted share, versus its previously issued guidance in the range of $0.35 - $0.38 per share.

On March 8, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Registrant approved an amendment and restatement (the Amendment) of the Registrants 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) for the purpose of extending the term of the Plan, as well as certain other administrative updates to the Plan.  The Amendment  was submitted for shareholder approval at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders that is scheduled for June 16, 2011 (the Annual Meeting). The proposed Amendment and its provisions are described in the Registrants definitive proxy statement, a copy of which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 6, 201 and incorporated herein by reference.
On June 1, 2011,  the Registrant was informed that ISS Proxy Advisory Services (ISS) had recommended a vote against the Amendment because, under the Plan, the original definition of a Change in Control, as contained in the Plan from its inception in 2002, states that a Change in Control shall occur upon shareholder approval (rather than upon consummation) of a merger, consolidation or complete liquidation of the Company or sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Companys assets.  In order to revise this definition to be meet ISSs current criteria for approval of equity plans, the Board of Directors of the Registrant has now approved an additional amendment (the Additional Amendment) to the Plan, pursuant to which the definition of a Change in Control has been revised to state that, a Change in Control will occur upon the consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation.
Under the terms of the Plan, the Additional Amendment  will become effective upon shareholder approval of the Plan at the Annual Meeting and shall only effect grants of equity made by the Registrant after shareholder approval of the Plan is received.  The foregoing description of the Additional Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today announced updated expectations for the second quarter.
New York, New York  August 4, 2011
 
For the second quarter of fiscal 2011 net sales decreased 5% to $468.2 million, from $494.7 million in the year ago period. Same store sales for the second quarter decreased 14%, compared to a same store sales increase of 4% last year.
 
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are very disappointed with our second quarter financial results that were clearly unacceptable.  As a result of a lack of balance in our merchandise assortments, as well as continued promotional and macroeconomic challenges, we significantly increased the depth and breadth of our promotions and markdowns.  Mr. Johnson continued, Our top priority is to deliver a merchandise assortment that resonates with the teen customer and captures market share from our competitors.  Additionally, based on current business conditions that are likely to continue for the remainder of the year, we are planning our inventories conservatively and focusing aggressively on cost controls.  As we look to 2012 and beyond, we have great confidence in the strength of the Aropostale and PS brands, in our ability to develop balanced merchandise assortments for our customer, and in our capability to deliver improved financial performance and growth.
 
Based on the lower than expected sales and margins for the quarter, the Company expects net earnings to be in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 per share, which includes a non-recurring pre-tax benefit to the Companys gross profit of $8.7 million, or $0.06 per share, resulting from the resolution of a dispute with one of the Companys merchandise vendors, surrounding prior period allowances.

(d)
 
The Borrower shall repay the then entire unpaid balance of the Loan Account and all other Liabilities on the Termination Date.
 
(e)
 
The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) which the Agent or any Lender may sustain or incur (including, without limitation, by virtue of acceleration after the occurrence of any Event of Default) as a consequence of the following:
 
(i)
 
Default by the Borrower in payment of the principal amount of or any interest on any Eurodollar Loan as and when due and payable, including any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by the Agent or such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its Eurodollar Loans.
 
(ii)

(b)
 
Each Revolving Credit Loan which consists of a Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans.
 
(c)
 
Subject to the provisions hereof (including, but not limited to Section 2-2), the Borrower, by notice to the Agent, may cause all or a part of the unpaid principal balance of the Loan Account to bear interest at the Prime Rate or the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate as specified from time to time by the Borrower.
 
(d)

On the Termination Date and on the End Date.
 
(iii)
 
Following the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of Default, with such frequency as may be determined by the Agent.
 
(f)
 
Following the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Default Interest Event (and whether or not the Agent exercises the Agents rights on account thereof), all Revolving Credit Loans shall bear interest at a rate which is the aggregate of the interest rate then in effect plus two percent (2%) per annum, unless the Agent, with the consent of the Lenders with Required Consent, elects not to exercise its right to increase the interest rate in effect by said two percent (2%) per annum.
 
(g)
 
All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).

Other Fees.
 
 The Borrower shall pay (i) to the Arranger and the Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter, and (ii) upfront fees agreed to by the Loan Parties and any applicable Lender.

-32-
 
 
 
(iv)
 
Availability would not be exceeded.
 
(c)
 
The Issuer shall not issue any L/Cs hereunder without the prior consent of the Agent if:
 
(i)
 
any order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuer from issuing such L/C, or any law applicable to the Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any governmental authority with jurisdiction over the Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such L/C in particular or shall impose upon the Issuer with respect to such L/C any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon the Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective Date and which the Issuer in good faith deems material to it;
 
(ii)
 
the issuance of such L/C would violate one or more policies of the Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;
 
(iii)
 
such L/C is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; provided that if the L/C Issuer, in its discretion, issues an L/C denominated in a currency other than Dollars, all reimbursements by the Borrower of the honoring of any drawing under such L/C shall be paid in the currency in which such L/C was denominated;
 
(iv)

Cash Collateralization of L/Cs.
 
 With respect to all L/Cs, upon the Agents request after the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of Default hereunder, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Agent, an amount in cash equal to 103% of the then Stated Amount of all outstanding L/Cs.  Such deposit shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Liabilities.  The Agent shall have the exclusive dominion and control over such account.  Such deposits shall not bear interest.  Monies in such account shall be automatically applied by the Agent to reimburse the Issuer for any honoring of any L/Cs, together with any other amounts owed to the Issuer, and after all L/Cs have been so reimbursed or otherwise expired, any remaining balance shall be applied in reduction of the Liabilities.  In lieu of depositing such cash with the Agent, the Borrower may furnish the Agent with a so-called back-to-back letter of credit in form and substance and issued by a bank reasonably satisfactory to the Agent in its sole and absolute discretion, in an amount equal to 103% of the then Stated Amount of all outstanding L/Cs.  Drawings under such back-to-back letters of credit shall be applied by the Agent to the Liabilities in the manner set forth above with respect to the cash collateral account.  If no Event of Default then exists, the cash collateral deposited with the Agent and/or the amount of the back-to-back letters of credit may be reduced by an amount equal to any reduction from time to time in the Stated Amount of all outstanding L/Cs (other than on account of drawings thereunder).

(b)
 
The Issuer may honor, as complying with the terms of any L/C and of any drawing thereunder, any drafts or other documents otherwise in order, but signed or issued by an administrator, executor, conservator, trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver, or other legal representative of the party authorized under such L/C to draw or issue such drafts or other documents.

-35-
 
 
 
(ii)
 
impose on any Issuer any other condition or requirements relating to any such letters of credit;
 
and the result of any event referred to in Section 2-20(g)(i) or 2-20(g)(ii), above, shall be to increase the cost to any Issuer of issuing or maintaining any L/C (which increase in cost shall be the result of such Issuers reasonable allocation among that Issuers letter of credit customers of the aggregate of such cost increases resulting from such events), then, upon demand by the Agent and delivery by the Agent to the Borrower of a certificate of an officer of the subject Issuer describing such change in law, executive order, regulation, directive, or interpretation thereof, its effect on such Issuer, and the basis for determining such increased costs and their allocation, the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent, from time to time as specified by the Agent, such amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Issuer for such increased cost;   the Borrower shall not be obligated to make payment of such amounts which arise from transactions which occurred more than ninety (90) Business Days prior to the Agents furnishing notice hereunder.

Changed Circumstances.
 
(a)
 
The Agent may give the Borrower notice of the occurrence of the following:
 
(i)
 
The Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be final and conclusive) on any day on which the rate for a Eurodollar Loan would otherwise be set, that adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining such rate.
 
(ii)
 
The Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be final and conclusive) that:
 
(A)
 
The continuation of or conversion of any Revolving Credit Loan to a Eurodollar Loan has been made impracticable or unlawful by the occurrence of a contingency that materially and adversely affects the applicable market or compliance by the Agent in good faith with any applicable Requirements of Law or interpretation or change thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or with any request or directive of any such governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law).
 
 
 
-36-
 
 
 
(B)
 
The indices on which the interest rates for Eurodollar Loans are based shall no longer represent the effective cost to the Agent or any Lender for U.S. dollar deposits in the interbank market for deposits in which it regularly participates.
 
(b)
 
In the event that the Agent gives the Borrower notice of an occurrence described in Section 2-21(a), then, until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer apply:
 
(i)
 
The obligation of the Agent and each Lender to make Eurodollar Loans of the type affected by such changed circumstances or to permit the Borrower to select the affected interest rate as otherwise applicable to any Revolving Credit Loans shall be suspended.
 
(ii)
 
Any notice which the Borrower had given the Agent with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, the time for action with respect to which has not occurred prior to the Agents having given notice pursuant to Section 2-21(a), shall be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan.
 
(c)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Lender agrees to use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions and so long as such efforts would not be disadvantageous to it, in its reasonable discretion, in any legal, economic or regulatory manner) to designate a different lending office if the making of such designation would allow such Lender or its lending office to continue to make Eurodollar Loans.

Increased Costs
.  If there is adopted after the date hereof any requirement of law, or if there is any new interpretation or application of any law after the date hereof by any court or by any governmental or other authority or entity charged with the administration thereof, whether or not having the force of law, which:
 
(a)
 
subjects the Agent or any Lender to any Taxes or changes the basis of taxation, or increases any existing Taxes, on payments of principal, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower to the Agent or any Lender under this Agreement (except for Taxes on the Agent or any Lenders overall net income or capital imposed by the jurisdiction in which the Agent or such Lenders principal or lending offices are located or in which the Agent or such Lender is organized);
 
(b)
 
imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, cash margin, special deposit or similar requirements against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of or loans by or any other acquisition of funds by the relevant funding office of any Lender;
 
(c)
 
imposes on any Lender any other condition with respect to any Loan Document; or
 
(d)
 
imposes on any Lender a requirement to maintain or allocate capital in relation to the Liabilities;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing, in the Agents reasonable opinion, is to increase the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any loan, advance or financial accommodation or to reduce the income receivable by any Lender in respect of any loan, advance or financial accommodation by an amount which the Agent deems to be material, then upon the Agents giving written notice thereof to the Borrower (such notice to set out in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to and a summary calculation of such increased cost or reduced income), the Borrower shall forthwith pay to the Agent, for the benefit of such Lender, upon receipt of such notice, that amount which shall compensate such Lender for such additional cost or reduction in income, the Borrower shall not be obligated to make payment of such amounts which arise from transactions which occurred more than ninety (90) Business Days prior to the Agents furnishing notice hereunder.
provided that
 
 
 
-37-
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Lender agrees to use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions and so long as such efforts would not be disadvantageous to it, in its reasonable discretion, in any legal, economic or regulatory manner) to designate a different lending office if the making of such designation would allow such Lender or its lending office to avoid the imposition of such increased costs.
 
2-23.

(ii)
 
Any assignment shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld).
 
(iii)
 
Any such assignment or reallocation shall be on a pro-rata basis such that each reallocated or assigned Dollar Commitment to any Person remains the same percentage of the overall Commitment (in terms of dollars) as the reallocated Commitment Percentage is to such Person; provided that this clause (iii) shall not apply to the Swing Line Lenders rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans.
 
(iv)
 
No such assignment shall be in an amount less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or, if less, the total Dollar Commitment of such assigning Lender.

Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.
 
(c)
 
The Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders responses to each request made in this .  To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Agent, the Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), to the extent that the existing Lenders decline to increase their Commitments, or decline to increase their Commitments to the amount requested by the Borrower, the Agent will use its reasonable efforts to arrange for other Person(s) to become a Lender hereunder and to issue commitments in an amount equal to the amount of the increase in the Commitment requested by the Borrower and not accepted by the existing Lenders  (each such Person issuing a commitment and becoming a Lender hereunder, an ), provided, however, that without the consent of the Agent, at no time shall the Commitment of any Additional Commitment Lender be less than $10,000,000.00.

IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR OFFERING A DEDUCTIBLE PLAN AND LOSS REIMBURSEMENT PLAN TO YOU AS PART OF THE LOSS RESPONSIVE RATING PLAN COMPONENT OF OUR PROPOSAL, YOU REPRESENT TO US, AS PART OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PROPOSAL, THAT YOU WILL REIMBURSE US FOR DEDUCTIBLE PLAN AND LOSS REIMBURSEMENT PLAN LOSSES, ALLOCATED LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, DEDUCTIBLE PLAN AND LOSS REIMBURSEMENT PLAN CLAIMS HANDLING REIMBURSEMENT CHARGES, DEDUCTIBLE PLAN AND LOSS REIMBURSEMENT PLAN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS, APPLICABLE PREMIUM TAXES (IF ANY) AND ANY OTHER DEDUCTIBLE PLAN AND LOSS REIMBURSEMENT PLAN CHARGES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT YOU WILL COLLATERALIZE YOUR REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION USING COLLATERAL ACCEPTABLE TO US IN FORM, CONTENT, ISSUER AND AMOUNT. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THIS REPRESENTATION TO US BY YOU CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL REPRESENTATION AND THAT YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE US WITH THIS REPRESENTATION IS A MAJOR REASON WHY WE ARE OFFERING YOU A DEDUCTIBLE PLAN AND LOSS REIMBURSEMENT PLAN AS PART OF OUR PROPOSAL.
 
COLLATERAL REQUIREMENT
 
 
With respect to any form of Collateral other than any Letter of Credit we are currently holding, should your insurance program with us be cancelled or non-renewed, we may at our sole option require you to substitute as Collateral a Letter of Credit satisfactory to us in form, content, issuer and amount for the full amount of such Collateral.
 
You shall provide such Letter of Credit within fifteen (15) days after your receipt of our notice of the need for any such change in Collateral.
 
We and you agree that prior to a default we may deplete the cash Collateral and apply such funds against your WC Deductible Plan, WC Loss Reimbursement Plan and WC Retrospective Plan Obligations. If we require additional cash Collateral and you fail to deliver such additional cash Collateral, we may stop depleting the cash Collateral we hold and bill you for any Obligations. Such actions shall in no way affect the continuing validity of our security interest in the remaining cash Collateral.

CASH COLLATERAL ADJUSTMENT
 
The amount of cash Collateral held for this Policy year will be adjusted, subject to the Collateral and Remedies Section of the Agreement, pursuant to the formula set forth below.
 
Cash Collateral = [(Incurred Deductible Losses + Incurred Loss Reimbursement Plan Losses + Retrospective Plan Incurred Losses) X Loss Development Factor] [Deductible Losses + Loss Reimbursement Plan Losses + Retrospective Plan Paid Losses]
 
Losses referenced in the formula are valued as of the Adjustment Dates noted below. The Loss Development Factors referenced in the formula above are also set forth below.
 
 
We will immediately adjust the amount of additional cash Collateral we require pursuant to the formula if, at any time between the scheduled dates referenced above, the amount of cash Collateral we are holding falls below $100,000, and you shall deliver to us such additional cash Collateral as set forth in the Collateral and Remedies Section of the Agreement.
 
In addition, we may require of you at any other time between adjustments an increase in the amount of cash Collateral we hold, or in the amount of any Letters of Credit we take as a substitute for the cash Collateral. The amount of the increase will be determined by us in the good faith exercise of our business judgment. Within fifteen (15) days after we have given you written notice of such an increase in cash Collateral, you will deliver to us the additional cash or increase in the amount of the Letters of Credit as is acceptable to us.
 
SUBSTITUTION
OF COLLATERAL
 
WITH RESPECT TO THE CASH COLLATERAL:
 
Subject to your payment of an Administrative Fee as set forth below, you may substitute at any time for the cash Collateral a Letter of Credit (in addition to any other Letter of Credit we may be holding to secure your Obligations to us) which complies with the terms of the Agreement.
 
Administrative Fee = * X
Cash Collateral Balance at Substitution Date
 
Total Cash Collateral Paid By You
 
The Administrative Fee generated by this formula is a fee for the Agreement for this program effective date only. Should a Letter of Credit be substituted for the cash Collateral at any time, a Total Administrative Fee will be assessed to you. This Total Administrative Fee will be the sum of your Administrative Fees for all Agreements for all program years.

Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 Disclosure
 
On December 26, 2007, the President of the United States signed into law amendments to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "Act"), which, among other things, extend the Act and expand its scope. The Act establishes a program under which the Federal Government may partially reimburse "Insured Losses" (as defined in the Act) caused by "acts of terrorism". An "act of terrorism" is defined in Section 102(1) of the Act to mean any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the United States to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.
 
The federal government's share of compensation for Insured Losses is 85% of the amount of Insured Losses in excess of each Insurer's statutorily established deductible, subject to the "Program Trigger", (as defined in the Act). In no event, however, will the federal government or any Insurer be required to pay any portion of the amount of aggregate Insured Losses occurring in any one year that exceeds $100,000,000,000, provided that such Insurer has met its deductible. If aggregate Insured Losses exceed $100,000,000,000 in any one year, your coverage may therefore be reduced.
 
The charge for Insured Losses is included in the total premium for each coverage indicated in this Proposal. The charge that has been included for each coverage is indicated below and does not include any charges for the portion of losses covered by the federal government under the Act.

Coverage for acts of terrorism is included in your policy. You are hereby notified that under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended in 2007, the definition of act of terrorism has changed. As defined in Section 102(1) of the Act: The term "act of terrorism" means any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasuryin concurrence with the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General of the United Statesto be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion. Under your coverage, any losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism may be partially reimbursed by the United States Government under a formula established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended. However, your policy may contain other exclusions which might affect your coverage, such as an exclusion for nuclear events. Under the formula, the United States Government generally reimburses 85% of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance company providing the coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended, contains a $100 billion cap that limits U.S. Government reimbursement as well as insurers' liability for losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism when the amount of such losses exceeds $100 billion in any one calendar year. If the aggregate insured losses for all insurers exceed $100 billion, your coverage may be reduced.
 
The portion of your annual premium that is attributable to coverage for acts of terrorism is *, and does not include any charges for the portion of losses covered by the United States government under the Act.
 
BY RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE YOU HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED, UNDER THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT, AS AMENDED, THAT COVERAGE UNDER THIS POLICY FOR ANY LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM, MAY BE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO A $100 BILLION CAP THAT MAY REDUCE YOUR COVERAGE. YOU HAVE ALSO BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE PORTION OF YOUR PREMIUM ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH COVERAGE.

You are hereby notified that, under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (the "Act"), effective December 26, 2007, this policy makes available to you insurance for losses arising out of certain acts of terrorism. Terrorism is defined as any act certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or vessel or the premises of a United States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.
 
You should know that the insurance provided by your policy for losses caused by acts of terrorism is partially reimbursed by the United States under the formula set forth in the Act. Under this formula, the United States pays 85% of covered terrorism losses that exceed the statutorily established deductible to be paid by the insurance company providing the coverage.
 
However, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed $100 billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31), the Treasury shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion.
 
 
 
If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed $100 billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31) and we have met our insurer deductible under the Act, we shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the Treasury.
 
The portion of your policy's annual premium that is attributable to insurance for such acts of terrorism is: *.

POLICYHOLDER
 
You are hereby notified that, under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (the "Act"), effective December 26, 2007, this policy makes available to you insurance for losses arising out of certain acts of terrorism. Terrorism is defined as any act certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or vessel or the premises of a United States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.
 
You should know that the insurance provided by your policy for losses caused by acts of terrorism is partially reimbursed by the United States under the formula set forth in the Act. Under this formula, the United States pays 85% of covered terrorism losses that exceed the statutorily established deductible to be paid by the insurance company providing the coverage.
 
However, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed $100 billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31), the Treasury shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion.
 
 
 
 
 
If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed $100 billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31) and we have met our insurer deductible under the Act, we shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the Treasury.
 
The portion of your policy's annual premium that is attributable to insurance for such acts of terrorism is: *.

-- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011, and provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
New York, New York, March 8, 2012
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, I am very proud of the speed, diligence and tenacity of our entire team in addressing our business challenges.  We worked swiftly and strategically throughout the year to infuse newness into our merchandise assortment and evolve the projection of our fashion message.  While our overall financial performance for the year was disappointing, we believe 2011 was a pivotal inflection point for our organization.
Fourth Quarter Performance
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, net sales decreased 4% to $808.4 million, from $839.3 million in the year ago period. Same store sales for the fourth quarter decreased 9%, compared to a same store sales decrease of 3% last year.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $26.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, which included an after-tax charge of $9.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, resulting from store asset impairment charges.  The Company reported net income of $83.8 million, or $0.95 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year.
Excluding the store asset impairment charges, the Company reported adjusted net income of $35.6 million, and adjusted earnings of $0.44 per diluted share (see Exhibit D).  This compares to the Companys previously issued guidance of $0.35 to $0.38 per diluted share, which did not include the aforementioned charges.
Full Fiscal Year Performance
Net sales for fiscal 2011 decreased 2% to $2.342 billion, from $2.400 billion in the year ago period. Same store sales for fiscal 2011 decreased 9%, compared to a same store sales increase of 1% last year.
Net income for fiscal 2011 was $69.5 million, or $0.85 per diluted share. Results for fiscal 2011 included the following items:
Excluding these items, adjusted net income for fiscal 2011 was $73.3 million, and adjusted earnings was $0.90 per diluted share.
The Company reported net income of  $231.3 million, or $2.49 per diluted share in the same period last year, which included an after tax charge of $3.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, resulting from a retirement plan charge.
E-commerce
Net revenues from the Companys e-commerce business for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 8% to $83.2 million, from $77.3 million in the year ago period.  Net revenues from the Companys e-commerce business for fiscal 2011 increased 14% to $182.1 million, from $160.2 million in the year ago period.
Share Repurchase Program
The Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of common stock for $100.1 million during fiscal 2011. As of January 28, 2012 the Company had $145.2 million of remaining buyback availability under the $1.15 billion share repurchase program.
First Quarter Guidance
For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company expects earnings in the range of $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $0.20 per diluted share last year.
Mr. Johnson, continued, Looking to 2012, Aropostale is committed to repositioning our brand for future success.

AROPOSTALE
PROVIDES BUSINESS UPDATE
New York, New York - August 2, 2012
- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today announced updated expectations for the second quarter.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, net sales increased 4% to $485.3 million, from $468.2 million in the year ago period. Comparable sales, including the e-commerce channel, for the second quarter were essentially flat, compared to a 12% decrease last year. Same store sales, excluding the e-commerce channel, for the second quarter decreased 1%, compared to a 14% decrease last year.
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are clearly disappointed that our second quarter results fell below our initial expectations. While we delivered a more cohesive fashion offering and continued to improve our sales per transactions, our overall store traffic was weaker than anticipated.
Mr. Johnson continued, We remain confident with our strong market positioning and our long-term strategic initiatives, which include evolving our merchandise assortment and increasing our brand projection and fashion message to the consumer.
Based on lower than expected sales and margins for the quarter, the Company now expects second quarter earnings to be approximately $0.00 per diluted share, versus its previously issued guidance range of $0.03 to $0.05 per diluted share.
The Company expects to announce second quarter earnings and an update on back-to-school trends on Thursday, August 16, 2012 at 4:15 PM (EDT).

Exhibit 99.1
AROPOSTALE REPORTS RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012
Second Quarter Earnings of $0.00 Per Diluted Share
Provides Third Quarter Guidance
New York, New York, August 16, 2012
-- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and provided guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2012.
Second Quarter Performance
Net income for the second quarter of 2012 was approximately $0.1 million, or $0.00 per diluted share. Net income for the second quarter of 2011 was $2.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, which included a non-recurring pre-tax benefit to the Companys gross profit of $8.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, which resulted from the resolution of a dispute with one of the Companys sourcing agents. Of this benefit, $8.0 million, related to periods prior to fiscal 2011. Excluding this item, the adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2011 was ($1.7) million, or ($0.02) per diluted share.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, net sales increased 4% to $485.3 million, from $468.2 million in the year ago period. Comparable sales, including the e-commerce channel, for the second quarter were essentially flat compared to a 12% decrease last year. Comparable store sales, excluding the e-commerce channel, for the second quarter decreased 1%, compared to a 14% decrease last year.
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "While we were encouraged by the customer response to our fashion offering, we were disappointed by our overall financial performance for the second quarter. Our core basics business experienced significant pricing pressure due to the highly promotional and competitive retail landscape. As a result, we promoted these businesses more aggressively than initially expected to end the quarter with inventories inline with our plan.
E-commerce
Net revenue from the Companys e-commerce business for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 increased 27% to $31.9 million, from $25.1 million in the year ago period.
Cash Positioning and Share Repurchase Program
The Company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $169.6 million and no debt. The Company currently has $145.2 million of availability remaining under its share repurchase program.
Store Growth and Capital Spending
The Company opened seven Aropostale and 15 P.S. from Aropostale stores, and closed four Aropostale stores during the quarter. For the second quarter, the Company invested $20.8 million in planned capital expenditures.
Third Quarter Guidance
Based on a soft start to the important back-to-school selling season, the Company expects earnings in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $0.30 per diluted share in the same period last year.
1
Mr. Johnson continued, While I believe we are focused on the right key initiatives to improve our overall business, sales trends for the early back-to-school season have been inconsistent. As we move through the remainder of the year, our entire organization is aligned and committed to executing on our strategic initiatives with a sense of urgency and determination.
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
The Company believes that the disclosure of adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per diluted share, which are non-GAAP financial measures, provides investors with useful information to help them better understand the Companys results (see Exhibit D).

Aropostale Reports Results for Third Quarter of Fiscal 2012
Third Quarter Earnings of $0.31 Per Diluted Share
Provides Fourth Quarter Guidance
New York, New York, November 28, 2012
-- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, and provided guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
Third Quarter Performance
Diluted net earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $0.31 per share, compared to $0.30 per diluted share in the same period last year. Net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $24.9 million, compared to net income of $24.1 million last year.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, net sales increased 2% to $605.9 million, from $596.5 million in the year ago period. Comparable sales, including the e-commerce channel, for the third quarter decreased 1% compared to a 7% decrease last year. Comparable store sales, excluding the e-commerce channel, for the third quarter decreased 2%, compared to a 9% decrease last year.
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, For the third quarter, we achieved net earnings slightly ahead of our previously issued guidance. Although we experienced pressure on our women's core basics business, she responded positively to our fashion offering. In addition, our men's and accessories businesses performed well.
E-commerce
Net revenue from the Company's e-commerce business for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 increased 12% to $51.1 million, from $45.7 million in the year ago period.
Cash Position and Share Repurchase Program
The Company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $184.5 million and no debt. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased approximately $40.8 million, or 3.0 million shares of common stock. The Company currently has $104.4 million of availability remaining under its share repurchase program.
Store Growth and Capital Spending
The Company opened five Aropostale and five P.S. from Aropostale stores, and closed two Aropostale and two temporary P.S. from Aropostale stores during the quarter. For the third quarter, the Company invested $15.9 million in planned capital expenditures.
Fourth Quarter Guidance
The Company announced earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $0.36 to $0.41 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $0.44 per diluted share in the same period last year. This earnings guidance does not include the impact of any potential store asset impairment charges, and assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 43.5% versus a tax rate of 35.9% last year.
Mr. Johnson continued, While our performance over the Black Friday weekend was encouraging, the environment during the first few weeks of November was challenging. As a result, we continue to be cautious for the remainder of the quarter given the inconsistency we are seeing in our business against the backdrop of a highly promotional environment. We will continue to focus on delivering on our strategic initiatives, managing our business conservatively, and ending the quarter with inventories well-controlled.

Fourth Quarter Loss of $0.01 Per Diluted Share;
Adjusted Earnings of $0.24 Per Diluted Share In-Line with Previously Issued Guidance of $0.20 to $0.24
Provides First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Guidance
New York, New York, March 14, 2013
-- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today reported results for the fourth quarter of 2012 (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 consisted of 14 weeks compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which consisted of 13 weeks) and fiscal 2012 (fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks compared to fiscal 2011, which consisted of 52 weeks). The Company also provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
Fourth Quarter Performance
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, net sales decreased 1% to $797.7 million, from $808.4 million in the year ago period. Fourth quarter comparable sales, including the e-commerce channel, decreased 8% compared to a 7% decrease for the corresponding 14-week period of the prior year. Fourth quarter comparable store sales, excluding the e-commerce channel, decreased 9%, compared to a decrease of 9% for the corresponding 14-week period of the prior year.
The Company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, which included an after-tax charge of $19.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, resulting from store asset impairment charges. The Company reported net income of $26.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2011, which included an after-tax charge of $9.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, resulting from store asset impairment charges.
Excluding the aforementioned store asset impairment charges, the Company reported adjusted net income of $19.1 million, and adjusted earnings of $0.24 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012 (see Exhibit D). This compares to the Company's previously issued guidance of $0.20 to $0.24 per diluted share, which did not include the aforementioned charges. Also excluding store asset impairment charges, the Company reported adjusted net income of $35.6 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Full Fiscal Year Performance
Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased 2% to $2.386 billion, from $2.342 billion in the year ago period. Fiscal 2012 comparable sales, including the e-commerce channel, decreased 2% compared to an 8% decrease for the comparable 53-week period of the prior year. Fiscal 2012 comparable store sales, excluding the e-commerce channel, decreased 4%, compared to a decrease of 9% for the comparable 53-week period of the prior year.
Net income for fiscal 2012 was $34.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, which included an after-tax charge of $19.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, resulting from store asset impairment charges.
Net income for fiscal 2011 was $69.5 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, which included the following items:
Excluding these items in both years, adjusted net income for fiscal 2012 was $54.7 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income for fiscal 2011 of $73.3 million, or $0.90 per diluted share (see Exhibit D).
1
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, Our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year were disappointing; however, we made progress during 2012 against our strategic initiatives. We added new talent to our team, injected more relevant fashion into our assortments, and developed our next generation store model. Further, we continued to build positive momentum in our P.S. business, extended our global reach by opening in new markets, and grew our e-commerce business, which included the successful acquisition of GoJane.com. While we have not reached the level and consistency in our performance for which we strive, we are committed to evolving and transforming our product to position ourselves as a true lifestyle brand.
E-commerce
Net revenues from the Company's e-commerce business for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, including net revenues from the GoJane business beginning November 14, 2012, increased 16% to $96.8 million, from $83.2 million in the year ago period. Net revenues from the Company's e-commerce business for fiscal 2012 increased 19% to $217.0 million, from $182.1 million in the year ago period.
Cash Positioning and Share Repurchase Program
The Company ended fiscal 2012 with cash and cash equivalents of $231.5 million and no debt. The Company repurchased 3.0 million shares of common stock for approximately $40.8 million during fiscal 2012. The Company currently has $104.4 million of availability remaining under its share repurchase program.
First Quarter Guidance
For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company expects to report a loss in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $0.13 per diluted share last year.
Mr. Johnson continued, We anticipate a challenging first quarter as a result of expected margin pressures from Holiday carryover inventory, and the impact of a weak macroeconomic environment. We will continue to plan our business conservatively and manage our cost structure carefully. While we face near-term challenges, we believe we have the right strategies and the right team in place to improve the trajectory of our business.
Store Growth and Capital Spending for Fiscal 2013
For fiscal 2013, the Company plans to open approximately 14 Aropostale stores, approximately 60 P.S. from Aropostale stores, remodel approximately 30 stores, and close approximately 15 to 20 Aropostale stores. The Company expects to invest approximately $89.0 million in its store growth and certain information technology. This compares to capital expenditures of approximately $72.3 million in fiscal 2012.

The registrant announced today that it has entered into an Employment Agreement, effective May 3, 2013, with Thomas P. Johnson, the registrant's Chief Executive Officer. A summary of the material terms of the Employment Agreement are as follows:
We entered into an employment agreement with Thomas P. Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer, effective May 3, 2013 (Effective Date) that is in effect for three (3) years from the Effective Date. During the employment period, Mr. Johnson receives an annual base salary of $950,000, an annual incentive bonus, and medical and other benefits. Mr. Johnson has an opportunity to earn an annual bonus of up to 300% of Mr. Johnson's then applicable base salary, dependent upon the registrant's and his individual performance. Mr. Johnson's annual bonus is capped at three times his base salary in respect of any fiscal year. The annual bonus is payable pursuant to the terms of the registrant's Annual Incentive Bonus Plan (AIP).
In accordance with the registrant's customary annual equity grant practice, Mr. Johnson received (i) a grant from the registrant of such number of shares of the registrant's restricted stock equating to, on the grant date, $1,500,000. This restricted stock vests three (3) years from the grant date, and (ii) an award of restricted stock, in the form of performance shares, which had a grant date value of $1,500,000. This award will also vest three years from the date of that grant. In accordance with the registrant's updated award parameters for annual awards of performance shares, if the registrant's financial performance is met during an annual period, then the associated number of performance shares is banked and paid at the end of the applicable 3-year performance period.
Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Johnson's Employment Agreement, upon execution of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Johnson received a long-term incentive award as follows: (i) an award of restricted stock, in the form of performance shares, which had a grant date value of $4,500,000 and will vest at the end of the registrant's three (3) year performance period for awards made in the registrant's 2013 fiscal year, and (ii) an award of Cash-settled Stock Appreciation Rights, which shall have an award date value of $5,570,000 (the CSARs). The number of CSARs shall be determined by dividing $5,570,000 by the Black Scholes value of the closing price of a share of the registrant's common stock on the award date. The CSARs shall have a term of 7 years and shall vest in equal 1/3 increments over three years from the Effective Date. Additionally, the registrant may, in its sole discretion, at any time during the Term, exchange a CSAR for another form of registrant equity which is of equal value to the CSAR at the time of the exchange. As with all performance-based share awards, at the completion of the applicable performance period, the actual value of the performance award will be determined, dependent upon actual registrant financial results as compared to the stated registrant financial goals approved by the registrant's Compensation Committee for the applicable performance period.
Mr. Johnson is entitled to participate in any benefit plan we maintain for our senior executive officers, including any life, medical, accident, or disability insurance plan, and any pension, profit sharing, retirement, deferred compensation or savings plan for our senior executive officers. We also will reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by Mr. Johnson in the performance of his duties and indemnify Mr. Johnson against any loss or liability suffered in connection with such performance.
We are entitled to terminate the Employment Agreement with or without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement). Mr. Johnson is entitled to terminate his Employment Agreement for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement) which includes any breach of a material term of the Employment Agreement; a material alteration or diminution in his duties and responsibilities which includes no-longer being employed as the Chief Executive Officer of a company whose securities are publicly traded on a nationally recognized securities exchange; a Change in Control of the registrant (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and either (i) Mr. Johnson is terminated from being a director, officer or employee of, or from performing other services for, the registrant or a subsidiary of the registrant within two years after such Change in Control or (ii) without the consent of Mr. Johnson, a material change in the authorities, powers, functions and/or duties associated with his position or any reduction in Mr. Johnson's Base Salary or AIP targeted bonus; without the consent of Mr. Johnson either (a) Mr. Johnson ceases to report directly the Board, or (ii) ) Mr. Johnson ceases to be the final decision maker on all business related matters for the registrant; and with Mr. Johnson's consent, relocating the corporate offices greater than a 50 mile radius from their current location.
In the event of a Change in Control and the Employment Agreement being terminated within two (2) years of such Change in Control, without Cause by us or with Good Reason by Mr. Johnson, or if, without the consent of Mr. Johnson, a material change in the authorities, powers, functions and/or duties associated with his position or any reduction in Mr. Johnson's Base Salary or AIP targeted bonus occurs, then Mr. Johnson will be entitled to a severance payment equal to three times the sum of (i) his annual base salary payable and (ii) the bonus amount which would have been owed to Mr. Johnson for the applicable fiscal year in which the termination of the agreement occurred, calculated at the Target level. In addition, at the time of a Change in Control all unvested restricted stock and unvested performance shares outstanding shall vest in accordance with the terms of our 2002 Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Other than after a Change in Control, if we terminate Mr. Johnson's employment without Cause or if Mr. Johnson resigns his position for Good Reason, he will be entitled to receive the greater of his base salary for the remainder of the term of the employment agreement or two times his then applicable base salary, whichever is greater. Mr. Johnson will also be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of the annual bonus that would have been payable for the fiscal year in which such termination occurs, at a level no lower than the Threshold performance level, as well as a pro rata portion of the long term incentive award, which would have been payable had Mr. Johnson been employed by the registrant under the Employment Agreement for the entire performance period. In addition, all unvested options, unvested restricted stock, and unvested performance shares shall continue to vest for a period of one year from the termination of the Employment Agreement.
If Mr. Johnson's employment with the registrant terminates prior to the end of the contract term for any reason other than due to his death or disability, then he will be restricted from engaging in competitive activities during the Restricted Period (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and he will also be restricted from soliciting employees during the Restricted Period.
There are also additional customary provisions contained in the Employment Agreement. For greater detail, please see the full text of the Employment Agreement which is filed herewith.

Exhibit 99.1
Aropostale Reports Results for First Quarter of Fiscal 2013
New York, New York, May 23, 2013
-- Aropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, and provided guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
First Quarter Performance
For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, net sales decreased 9% to $452.3 million, from $497.2 million in the year ago period. Comparable sales, including the e-commerce channel, for the first quarter decreased 14%, compared to the corresponding 13-week period ended May 5, 2012.
The Company reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2013 of $12.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. The Company reported net income of $10.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2012.
 
Thomas P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, As we had anticipated, our first quarter performance reflected an increase in promotional activity as we cleared through carryover inventory from the fourth quarter. In addition, we were impacted by a weak macroeconomic environment, as well as unseasonably cool weather. Our organization continues to work diligently to execute the initiatives we outlined earlier this year to transform the Aropostale brand and develop our future growth drivers.
E-commerce
Net revenues from the Company's e-commerce business for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, including net revenues from the GoJane.com business, which was acquired on November 13, 2012, increased 13% to $41.9 million, from $37.2 million in the year ago period.
Cash Position and Share Repurchase Program
The Company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $148.4 million and no debt. The Company currently has $104.4 million of availability remaining under its share repurchase program.
Store Growth and Capital Spending
The Company opened one Aropostale and 24 P.S. from Aropostale stores, and closed three Aropostale stores during the quarter. For the first quarter, the Company invested $16.4 million in planned capital expenditures.
Second Quarter Guidance
For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company expects to report a loss in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share. This compares to earnings of $0.00 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2012.
Mr. Johnson continued, Our second quarter guidance reflects limited visibility as we head into the initial back-to-school selling period, as well as the uncertainty regarding the overall macroeconomic environment. As we navigate the remainder of the year, we remain confident about the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives.

The Company will be holding a conference call today at 4:15 P.M EDT to review its first quarter results. The broadcast will be available through the 'Investor Relations' link at
