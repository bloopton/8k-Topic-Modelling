April 21, 2004Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced first quarter sales of $242.9 million, up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2003, and 25% from the first quarter of 2003. Sales of the company's new products grew 32% sequentially.
San Jose, Calif.,
 
First quarter net income was $58.8 million, $0.15 per diluted share, up 95% versus net income of $30.1 million, $0.08 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003. Gross margin was 68.8% for the first quarter of 2004 versus 67.1% for the first quarter of 2003. Gross margin included a 150 basis point ($3.6 million) benefit in the first quarter of 2004 and a 470 basis point ($9.1 million) benefit in the first quarter of 2003 resulting from the sale of inventory previously written down in 2001.
 
Altera repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $51.6 million and ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
"This has been another quarter with outstanding growth from our new products. Sales of Cyclone devices continue to ramp, with one million units shipped in this quarter, bringing our cumulative shipments to 2 million units. Cyclone devices are the clear leader among the newest generation low-cost FPGAs. In the high-density market, the combination of Stratix
devices and our HardCopy
solution continues to draw new customers to Altera, adding to our new product momentum," said John Daane, president and CEO. "We announced two next generation products during the quarterboth based on truly unique Altera architectures. Our 90-nm Stratix II devices use the industry's first adaptable FPGA architecture and are the industry's largest and fastest chips, offering performance and capabilities previously only available in ASICs and ASSPs. In addition, the MAX
II CPLD family signals the arrival of a radically different CPLD architecture. The MAX II family provides a superior solution for today's CPLD customers and the opportunity for Altera to set a new standard for the industry."
 
Altera continued to advance its leadership position in system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) solutions.

., July 21, 2004  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced second quarter sales of $269.0 million, up 11% from the first quarter of 2004 and 31% from the second quarter of 2003. Sales of the company's new products grew 45% sequentially.
San Jose, Calif
 
Second quarter net income was $75.3 million, $0.20 per diluted share, up 109% versus net income of $36.1 million, $0.09 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2003. Gross profit margin was 69.9% for the second quarter of 2004 versus 68.1% for the second quarter of 2003. Gross profit margin included a 160 basis point ($4.4 million) benefit in the second quarter of 2004 and a 450 basis point ($9.2 million) benefit in the second quarter of 2003 resulting from the sale of inventory previously written down in 2001. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.4%, bringing the effective tax rate to 23% on a year-to-date basis, consistent with management's current expectation of a 23% rate for the full year.

Altera repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $88.9 million and ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
"This was a great quarter for Altera's Stratix
device family and our new product portfolio. The Stratix family was the largest selling product line, and we believe that production-based demand is just beginning. Demand for Cyclone devices showed healthy growth, reflecting the ready availability and appeal of this low-cost family, which remains the best selling advanced low-cost FPGA in the market today," said John Daane, president and CEO. "We are now shipping Stratix II and MAX
II devices to customers and expect a smooth roll out of these new families. We also announced our new Cyclone II family, with new features and much lower costs, which will give us further strength to penetrate markets traditionally beyond the reach of programmable logic."
Altera continued to advance its leadership position in system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) solutions.

., October 20, 2004  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced third quarter sales of $264.6 million, up 26% from the third quarter of 2003 and down 2% from the second quarter of 2004. Sales of the company's new products grew 25% sequentially and were up 212% versus the prior year's third quarter.
San Jose, Calif
 
Third quarter net income was $83.1 million, $0.22 per diluted share, up 90%, versus net income of $43.8 million, $0.11 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003. Gross profit margin was 69.4% for the third quarter of 2004 versus 68.7% for the third quarter of 2003. Net income was favorably impacted by a one-time tax benefit of $17.1 million, $0.05 per diluted share, primarily related to a settlement with Hong Kong's Inland Revenue Department for the tax years 1997 to 2003.
 
Altera repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $23.2 million and ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
"Despite this quarter's challenges, our new 0.13-micron products remain on a fast track, with very strong sequential growth. While we continue to see increasing production-driven demand for the Stratix
and Cyclone
families, we are still early in the transition from customer prototype volumes to large scale production-based orders. The peak of demand for these families is still ahead of us," said John Daane, president and CEO. "Available since June, and the only FPGAs to use a 90-nanometer process with high-performance, low-k dielectric materials, our Stratix II family rollout is progressing smoothly. The combination of this proven 90-nanometer manufacturing process, the new Stratix II architecture, and our Quartus
II development software delivers benchmarking comparisons that confirm the Stratix II family's performance superiority in the PLD industry."
 
 
Altera continued to advance its leadership position in system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) solutions.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
The following is a description of the Altera Corporation ("Altera") Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") provided pursuant to Paragraph 10(iii) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, which requires a written description of a compensatory plan when no formal document contains the compensation information.
 
The Altera Bonus Plan is effective beginning on January 1, 2005 and will remain effective for fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007. The purpose of the Bonus Plan is to promote the interests of Altera and its stockholders by providing key employees with financial rewards upon achievement of specified business objectives, as well as help Altera attract and retain key employees by providing attractive compensation opportunities linked to performance results.
 
Our Chief Executive Officer and the four most-highly-compensated executive officers, as well as other vice presidents and director-level employees, are eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan.
 
Bonuses payable under the Bonus Plan are determined by the independent members of the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee with respect to the CEO, and by the Compensation Committee with respect to other executive staff members.
 
Bonuses payable to eligible participants are based on a formula that takes into account (X) annual growth in Altera's revenue and net income as a percentage of revenue above a specified threshold (the "Financial Factors"), and (Y) performance against individual goals, which are set at the beginning of each fiscal year. Different multipliers are applied to each of the Financial Factors, with the specific multipliers depending on the individual's position within Altera. Bonuses are capped at a certain percentage of the individual's base salary, with the percentage depending on the individual's position within Altera. Employees who have received a needs improvement performance rating for the relevant measurement period are not eligible to receive a bonus.
 
Payment of bonuses (if any) is normally made in February after the end of the performance period during which the bonuses were earned. Bonuses normally will be paid in cash in a single lump sum, subject to payroll taxes and tax withholdings.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

., January 24, 2005  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced 2004 sales of $1.02 billion, up 23%, compared to $827.2 million in 2003. New product sales increased 186%. Net income for 2004 was $275.1 million, $0.72 per diluted share, versus net income of $155.1 million, $0.40 per diluted share in 2003.
San Jose, Calif
 
Fourth quarter sales were $239.9 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2003 and down 9% from the third quarter of 2004, versus the company's prior guidance for sales reductions of 9% to 12%. Fourth quarter net income was $58.0 million, $0.15 per diluted share, up 28%, compared to net income of $45.1 million, $0.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Gross profit margin was 69.8% for the fourth quarter of 2004 versus 67.5% for the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
Altera's tax rate for 2004 was 16.8% and included a $17.1 million or a 5.2 percentage point tax rate benefit primarily related to a tax settlement with Hong Kong's Inland Revenue Department recorded in the third quarter. The effective tax rate for the year was lowered in the fourth quarter by 1 percentage point, resulting in a favorable fourth quarter adjustment of $2.6 million (3.7 percentage points) and an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 18.3%.
 
Altera repurchased 8.3 million shares of its common stock during 2004 at a cost of $176.3 million, with 606,600 shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $12.6 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
"The year's revenue growth, fueled by great new product traction and FPGA market share gains, demonstrates that our R&D investments are paying off. The last half of the year was very challenging, and even as business moderated, we maintained strong gross margins and kept inventories under control," said John Daane, president and CEO. "In 2004 we announced another generation of products with a distinct performance edge. We introduced our Nios
II processor, a higher performance and more flexible version of our industry-leading Nios soft-core processor. Our new programmable devices, Stratix
II and Cyclone
II FPGAs and MAX
II CPLDs, all have substantial competitive performance advantages and the potential for rapid new product growth in 2005 and beyond. Across all our served markets we are uncovering new applications for programmable logic as we continue to pursue the substantial growth opportunities available to us."
 
Altera continued to advance its leadership position in system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) solutions.

"Stratix II FPGA revenues more than doubled sequentially and this family remains, by a wide margin, the best selling high-density FPGA for customers in the development phase today. This success builds on the market-leading position we previously established with our high-density Stratix and low-cost Cyclone families," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "We believe that the peak revenues for Cyclone and Stratix devices are still well ahead of us and that our overall competitive position for securing design wins at the leading edge is increasing with the Stratix II and Cyclone II families. On the CPLD side of our business, the MAX II family is now completely rolled out. We expect that this family, with its innovative low-cost architecture, will further expand our position as the world's leader in CPLDs."
 
Altera's innovation and execution made the company the fastest growing programmable logic company in 2004. The track record of innovation and execution continues in 2005:

From time to time the Board may increase the size of the Committee and appoint additional members, remove members (with or without cause) and substitute new members, fill vacancies (however caused), and remove all members of the Committee and thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by the rules under Rule 16b-3 relating to the disinterested administration of employee benefit plans under which Section 16 exempt discretionary grants and awards of equity securities are to be made.
Administration With Respect to Directors and Officers Subject to Section 16
 
(iii) . With respect to Option grants made to Employees who are neither Directors nor Officers of the Company, the
Administration With Respect to Other Persons
Plan shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a committee or committees designated by the Board, which committee shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws. Once appointed, such Committee shall serve in its designated capacity until otherwise directed by the Board. The Board may increase the size of the Committee and appoint additional members, remove members (with or without cause) and substitute new members, fill vacancies (however caused), and remove all members of the Committee and thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
 
(b) . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion:
Powers of the Administrator
 
(i) to grant options to Employees hereunder;
 
(ii) to determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2(n) of the Plan;
 
(iii) to determine the Employees eligible to be granted Options hereunder;
 
(iv) to determine whether and to what extent Options are granted hereunder;
 
(v) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Option granted hereunder;
 
(vi) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
 
(vii) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any award granted hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Options may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Option or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;
 
(viii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards granted pursuant to the Plan;
 
(ix) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax laws;
 
(x) to modify or amend each Option (subject to Section 14(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;
(xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Option previously granted by the Administrator; and
 
(xii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.
 
(c) . The Administrator's decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of Options.
Effect of Administrator's Decision
 
5. . Nonstatutory Stock Options may be granted to those Employees selected by the Administrator. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to those Employees selected by the Administrator. If otherwise eligible, an Employee who has been granted an Option may be granted additional Options.
Eligibility
 
6. .
Limitations
 
(a) Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted.
 
(b) Neither the Plan nor any Option shall confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's employment relationship with the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate such employment relationship at any time, with or without cause.
 
(c) The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options to Employees:
 
(i) No Employee shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company, Options to purchase more than 2,000,000 Shares.
 
(ii) In connection with his or her initial employment, an Employee may be granted Options to purchase up to an additional 2,000,000 Shares which shall not count against the limit set forth in subsection (i) above.
 
(iii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 12.
 
(d) .
Stock Option Exchange Program
 
(i) . Certain Optionees will be permitted to make a one-time exchange (the "Option Exchange Program") of certain Options for a lesser number of new
In General
Options ("Replacement Options"). Subject to part (iii) below, only Options having an exercise price that is at least 150% of the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock as of May 23, 2003 will be eligible for the exchange ("Eligible Options"). The fair market value of the Company's Common Stock is defined for purposes of the Option Exchange Program as the average closing price of the Company's Common Stock over the twenty trading days preceding May 23, 2003 (the "FMV"). All Optionees except for (1) the Company's six most highly compensated officers, (2) Employees hired after December 1, 2002, and (3) Employees located in countries where the Company decides, in its sole discretion, that it is not feasible or practical under local regulations to offer the Option Exchange Program are eligible to participate in the Option Exchange Program (collectively, "Eligible Optionees"). Subject to part (iii) below, Eligible Options that are tendered by Eligible Optionees will be exchanged for a lesser number of Replacement Options determined in accordance with the Option exchange ratios set forth below. The Replacement Options will be granted on a date determined by the Board of Directors that is at least six months and one day after the date on which the Eligible Options are surrendered.
 
(ii) . The number of Replacement Options granted according to the exchange ratios will be rounded down to the nearest whole share on a grant-by-grant basis. On May 23, 2003, the Administrator will select the Option exchange ratios from the table below based on the FMV as of May 23, 2003.
Exchange Ratios
 
 
 
If the FMV calculated on May 23, 2003 falls between any two of the values listed across the top row of the table above, the Administrator will interpolate between these values to determine an appropriate exchange ratio, rounded to the nearest 0.25 share. If the FMV calculated on May 23, 2003 is below $7.00 per share or above $17.00 per share, the exchange ratios will be recalculated based on the Black-Scholes valuation model. If the FMV calculated on May 23, 2003 is above $25.00 per share, the Option Exchange Program will be cancelled.
(iii) . Once an Eligible Optionee elects to participate in the Option Exchange Program, he or she will be required to tender any Options granted within the six months preceding the commencement of the Option Exchange Program ("Six Months Prior Options"). Six Months Prior Options are eligible to be exchanged even if such Options have an exercise price that is less than 150% of the FMV of the Company's Stock as of May 23, 2003.
Options Granted within Six-Months Prior to the Option Exchange Program
 
(iv) . Subject to possible differences in certain international locations, the Replacement Options will have an exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the new grant. Except in certain countries outside the United States as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion and except in the case of Six Months Prior Options, the Replacement Options will have a term of seven years and will vest over a thirty-month period with twenty percent vesting on the six-month anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting in equal amounts on a monthly basis. The Replacement Options for the Six Months Prior Options will have the same term and vesting schedule as the Options they are replacing. All other terms of the Replacement Options will be governed by the Plan.
Replacement Options
 
(v) . In order to facilitate participation in the Option Exchange Program by those Eligible Optionees who are employed by the Company outside the United States, the Administrator may provide for such modifications and additional terms and conditions to the Option Exchange Program as the Administrator may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, policy or custom, or to facilitate administration of the program.
Foreign Jurisdictions
 
7. . Subject to Section 18 of the Plan, the Plan shall become effective upon its approval by the shareholders of the Company as described in Section 18 of the Plan. It shall continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 14 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
 
8. . The term of each Option shall be stated in the Notice of Grant; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Notice of Grant.
Term of Option
 
9. .
Option Exercise Price and Consideration
 
(a) . The per share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
Exercise Price
 
(b) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. In so doing, the Administrator may specify that an Option may not be exercised until the completion of a service period.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
(c) . The Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of:
Form of Consideration
 
(i) cash;
 
(ii) check;
 
(iii) other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;
 
(iv) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with such other documentation as the Administrator and the broker, if applicable, shall require to effect an exercise of the Option and delivery to the Company of the sale or loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price;
 
(v) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;
 
(vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
 
(vii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
 
10. .
Exercise of Option
 
(a) . Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Option Agreement.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder
 
An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse. Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive
dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.
 
Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
 
(b) .
Termination of Employment Relationship
 
(i) . Upon termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, other than upon the Optionee's death, Disability, or Retirement, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Notice of Grant to the extent that he or she is entitled to exercise it on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant). In the absence of a specified time in the Notice of Grant, the Option shall remain exercisable for thirty (30) days following the Optionee's termination. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, such period of time for exercise shall not exceed three (3) months from the date of termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
In General
 
(ii) . In the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of his or her Retirement, such Optionee's Option shall, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, accelerate vesting or continue to vest, continue to become exercisable, and may be exercised during such period of time as is determined by the Administrator and as provided in the Option Agreement (but in no event may the Option be exercised after the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). If, at the end of such period of time, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
Retirement of Optionee
 
(iii) . Upon termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of the Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option at any time within three (3) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as is determined by the Administrator, with such determination in the case of an Incentive Stock Option being made at the time of grant of the Option) from the date of termination, but only to the extent that the Optionee is entitled to exercise it on the date of termination (and in no event later than the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant). If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her
Disability of Optionee
entire Option, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
 
(iv) . Upon the death of an Optionee:
Death of Optionee
 
(a) during the term of the Option who is at the time of his or her death an Employee of the Company and who shall have been in Continuous Status as an Employee since the date of grant of the Option, the Option may be exercised by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance at any time within six (6) months (or, in the case of Retirement, such longer period of time, not to exceed 12 months, as determined by the Administrator) following the date of death, but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement, and only to the extent of the right to exercise the Option that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and remained in Continuous Status as an Employee six (6) months after the date of death, subject to the limitation set forth in Section 6(a); or
 
(b) within thirty (30) days (or such other period of time not exceeding three (3) months as is determined by the Administrator, with such determination in the case of an Incentive Stock Option being made at the time of grant of the Option) after his or her termination of Continuous Status as an Employee, the Option may be exercised by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, at any time within six (6) months (or, in the case of Retirement, such longer period of time, not to exceed 12 months, as determined by the Administrator) following the date of death, but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement, and only to the extent of the right to exercise the Option that had accrued at the date of termination.
 
(c) . The Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.
Buyout Provisions
 
(d) . Options granted to individuals subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Insiders") must comply with the applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such additional conditions or restrictions as may, in the Administrator's sole discretion, be necessary and desirable to qualify thereunder for the maximum exemption from Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to Plan transactions.
Rule 16b-3
 
11. . An Option may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.
Non-Transferability of Options
12. .
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger, or Asset Sale
 
(a) . Subject to any required action by the shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each outstanding Option, and the number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Option, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding, and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option.
Changes in Capitalization
 
(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Optionee as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for an Optionee to have the right to exercise his or her Option prior to such transaction as to all of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to any Shares purchased upon exercise of an Option shall lapse as to all such Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
Dissolution or Liquidation
 
(c) . In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, each outstanding Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, the Optionee shall have the right to exercise the Option as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be exercisable. If an Option is exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger
Merger or Asset Sale
or sale of assets was not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets.
 
13. . The date of grant of an Option shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Option, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
 
14. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
 
(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
 
(b) . The Company shall obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Rule 16b-3 or with Section 422 of the Code (or any successor rule or statute or other applicable law, rule, or regulation, including the requirements of any exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted). Such shareholder approval, if required, shall be obtained in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by the applicable law, rule, or regulation.
Shareholder Approval
 
(c) . No amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
15. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
(a) . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, Applicable Laws, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
 
(b) . As a condition to the exercise of an Option, the Company may require the person exercising such Option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
16. .
Liability of Company
 
(a) . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
 
(b) . If the Optioned Stock covered by an Option exceeds, as of the date of grant, the number of Shares which may be issued under the Plan without additional shareholder approval, such Option shall be void with respect to such excess Optioned Stock, unless shareholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares subject to the Plan is timely obtained in accordance with Section 14(b) of the Plan.
Grants Exceeding Allotted Shares
 
17. . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
 
18. . Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months before or after the date the Plan is adopted. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws and the rules of any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is listed.
Shareholder Approval

., May 31, 2005 - Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced an update to its guidance for second quarter revenues and provision for income taxes.
San Jose, Calif
 
The company now expects that second quarter revenue will be at the higher end of its prior guidance of an increase in the range of 4 to 5%.
 
Sales of the company's newest products, Stratix II, Cyclone II, and MAX II, are ramping strongly, reflecting excellent availability and strong customer acceptance. Stratix II sales-to-date have already exceeded the total first quarter result. Stratix, Cyclone, and Hardcopy
sales are all tracking ahead of prior quarter sales and are expected to contribute to growth in the quarter.
 
As previously disclosed, the company settled two outstanding tax audits with favorable resolutions in April. As a result, the company will record a tax benefit of $15 to $20 million in the second quarter.
 
Additionally, pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the company has elected to repatriate $400 million of foreign earnings. As a consequence, the company will record a tax charge of approximately $21 million in the second quarter related to the extraordinary dividend.

The second quarter tax provision includes a $21 million charge related to the planned repatriation of $400 million in foreign earnings pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $15.2 million arising primarily from the settlement of Federal and California income tax audits during the quarter. The net impact of these two items added $5.8 million to the company's second quarter tax provision, reducing earnings per share by $0.01.
 
Altera repurchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $38.0 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments.
 
"Our new product growth rate accelerated from the first quarter's pace. Stratix
II FPGA sales doubled from the first quarter, and we continue to lead the 90-nm high-density FPGA market by a wide margin. While still very early in their life cycle, Cyclone
II FPGA and MAX
II CPLD sales more than tripled, demonstrating the revenue growth potential represented by these new families. This was also another great quarter for HardCopy
structured ASIC sales, with results up sharply from the first quarter," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Our two largest selling product families, Cyclone and Stratix FPGAs, also posted solid gains in the quarter. They remain the leading products of their generation in the PLD industry."
 
Altera's innovation and execution made the company the fastest-growing programmable logic supplier in 2004. This track record of innovation and execution continues in 2005:

., September 6, 2005  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced an update to its sales, gross margin, and research and development guidance.
San Jose, Calif
 
We expect that third quarter sales will be in line with prior guidance for 1% to 3% sequential growth. New product sales, quarter-to-date, are up strongly compared to the similar point in the prior quarter, led by the Stratix
FPGA family.
 
Third quarter gross margin will be lower than previously anticipated. We now expect third quarter gross margin will be in the range of 66% to 67% of sales versus earlier guidance of 68% to 69%. Across multiple end markets, high-margin, low-volume turns business quarter-to-date has been less than anticipated, leading to lower gross margins overall. We are now assuming that this mix change is permanent and are modifying our gross margin guidance for fourth quarter 2005, and 2006. For these periods we anticipate gross margins will be in the range of 65% to 67%.
 
As a result of lower mask and wafer purchases, third quarter research and development spending is now projected to be approximately $48 million, down from prior guidance of $52 million.
 
On September 7
th
, at 11:20 am Eastern Time, Nathan Sarkisian, our chief financial officer, will discuss this update during his presentation at the Citigroup Global Technology Conference.

Sales of the company's new products grew 23% sequentially and were up 66% from the prior year's third quarter.
San Jose, Calif
 
Third quarter net income was $77.8 million, $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $83.1 million, $0.22 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2004. Gross profit margin was 66.5% for the third quarter of 2005 versus 69.4 % for the third quarter of 2004.
 
The third quarter tax provision includes a $3.6 million charge related to the future repatriation of an additional $100 million of foreign earnings pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $2.6 million arising primarily from the settlement of federal and California income tax audits and the filing of U.S. and state 2004 income tax returns during the quarter. The net impact of these three items added $1 million to the company's third quarter tax provision.
 
Altera repurchased 4.7 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $93.8 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments.
 
"Every new product family grew sequentially this quarter, including FPGAs, CPLDs, and HardCopy
structured ASICs, creating another quarter of strong new product growth. The Stratix
and Stratix GX families collectively grew 40% sequentially and now represent more than 20% of Altera's revenues, demonstrating Altera's continuing leadership across this generation of high-density FPGAs," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Among our most recently introduced products, the Cyclone
II family is off to a fast start, extending the lead established with the original Cyclone family in the low-cost FPGA space. At the high end, the Stratix II FPGA family also grew strongly and remains the 90-nm high-density leader."
 
Altera's innovation and execution made the company the fastest-growing programmable logic supplier in 2004. This track record of innovation and execution continues in 2005:
 
 
 
Business Outlook
Altera expects sales in the fourth quarter to be unchanged compared to the third quarter, plus or minus 2%. Gross margins are likely to be in the range of 66%.

The company had earlier projected a $2.5 million benefit.
 
Operating expenses will be approximately $114 million, up from previous guidance of $111 million, in part the result of higher than anticipated mask, wafer, and prototyping costs in the fourth quarter.

On January 25, 2006, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
99.1    Press Release dated January 25, 2006
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: January 25, 2006
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
., January 25, 2006  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced 2005 sales of $1.12 billion, up 11%, compared with $1.02 billion in 2004. New product sales increased 73%. Net income for 2005 was $278.8 million, $0.74 per diluted share, versus net income of $275.1 million, $0.72 per diluted share, in 2004.
San Jose, Calif
 
Fourth quarter sales were $281.9 million, up 18% from the fourth quarter of 2004 and down 3% from the third quarter of 2005. The company's prior guidance was for fourth quarter sales to be in the range of $286 to $297 million. Fourth quarter net income was $69.7 million, $0.19 per diluted share, up 20%, compared with net income of $58.0 million, $0.15 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Gross profit margin was 66.7% for the fourth quarter of 2005 versus 69.8% for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Altera repurchased 19.9 million shares of its common stock during 2005 at a cost of $369.9 million, with 11.0 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $194.8 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and investments.
 
"We were the fastest growing major programmable logic company in 2005, as our Stratix and Cyclone series FPGAs drove market share gains," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "During the year we completed the rollout of the Cyclone II and MAX II families and announced our third generation HardCopy II structured ASICs and Stratix II GX transceiver-based FPGAs. Our product delivery performance was excellent and our lead times remained short. Customer-focused innovation, quality, and reliability made the year a success, and equip Altera for growth and solid performance in 2006."
 
 
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress.
 
 
 
 
 
Business Outlook for the First Quarter 2006
 
Altera expects that first quarter sales will increase 4% to 7% sequentially. Gross margin will be in the range of 65.5% to 67.5%. With the company's adoption of SFAS123R, first quarter operating expenses will include approximately $20 million of share-based compensation charges. Including those charges, operating expenses are expected to be approximately $138 million. Inclusion of stock-based compensation charges in operating expense adds significantly to the volatility of actual versus expected expense due to volatility in our stock price, which we cannot predict. Other income will be approximately $10 million. The company anticipates that its first quarter and full year tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%, including 200-300 basis points of benefit due to the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense in the income statement.
 
Note: The outlook above assumes the impact from the operation of the company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan will be nil.
 
Conference Call and Quarterly Update:
 
A conference call will be held today at 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the quarter's results and management's outlook for the first quarter of 2006.

Exhibit 10.35
 
 
Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in Altera's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") shall have the same defined meanings in this Award Agreement (Restricted Stock Units) (the "Agreement").
 
You have been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Grant ("Notice of Grant") and this Agreement.
 
Settlement of RSUs shall be made within 30 days following the applicable date of vesting under the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant. Settlement of RSUs shall be in Shares. Unless expressly determined otherwise by the Committee, prior services rendered to the Company by Participant shall constitute sufficient consideration for the payment of the par value per RSU (par value being $0.01 per Share).
1. .
Settlement
 
Unless and until such time as Shares are issued in settlement of vested RSUs, Participant shall have no ownership of the Shares allocated to the RSUs and shall have no right to vote such Shares, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions described in the Plan and herein.
2. .
No Stockholder Rights
 
Dividends, if any (whether in cash or Shares), shall not be credited to Participant as additional RSUs.

Notwithstanding the vesting provided for above, in the event a Participant who is an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, who is regularly scheduled to work twenty (20) hours or more per week, voluntarily chooses (i.e., other than for reasons protected by law) to reduce his or her work schedule with the Company or a subsidiary to fewer than twenty (20) hours per week, the RSUs subject to the award shall cease to vest during the period of time in which such employee regularly maintains such a schedule.
4. .

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On March 6, 2006, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing a business update for the first quarter. A copy of the business update is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: March 6, 2006
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
., March 6, 2006 - Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced its mid-quarter update for the first quarter of 2006.
San Jose, Calif
Altera reaffirms that first quarter sales will be in line with prior guidance for 4% to 7% sequential growth. New products are driving the company's growth with Stratix
II, Cyclone
II, MAX
II, and HardCopy
devices all showing strong results quarter-to-date.
As a result of a previously disclosed fourth quarter manufacturing issue, some MAX 3000 and MAX 7000 device lead times lengthened. The company believes that this supply issue will be largely resolved early in the second quarter. Additionally, manufacturing constraints are preventing the company from meeting all of its strong demand for Stratix and selected Stratix II FPGAs. The company currently expects Stratix and Stratix II lead times to return to normal in the second quarter.
The company reaffirms that first quarter gross margin will be in the range of 65.5% to 67.5%.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" as the term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as "will", "expect", "project", "estimates", or words that imply or predict a future state. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this release involve risks and uncertainty that can cause actual results to differ from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors, including without limitation, supply constraints, customer business environment, market acceptance of the company's products, the rate of growth of the company's new products including the Stratix II, Cyclone II, MAX II, and HardCopy device
families, changes in customer production-based demand, as well as changing economic conditions, and other risk factors discussed in documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
(b) Retirement of Director.
On March 13, 2006, Charles M. Clough notified the Board of Directors of Altera Corporation (the "Company") that he intends to retire and will not seek re-election to the Company's Board of Directors at the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders on May 9, 2006.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
(a) Amendment to Bylaws.
On March 13, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors voted to amend Sections 2.7 and 3.3 of the Company's bylaws to provide that directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares entitled to vote on the election of directors and represented in person or by proxy at annual stockholder meetings casting their vote "for" a director must exceed the number of such votes cast "against" that director. In contested elections, when the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of the votes cast.
If a nominee for director, who is not serving as a director of the Company at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall not be elected. If a nominee for director, who is serving as a director of the Company at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall tender his or her resignation to the Company's Board of Directors. The Company's Nominating and Governance Committee shall then make a recommendation to the Company's Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Company's Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the reasons for it within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.
The amended bylaws are effective as of March 13, 2006 and are attached as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Company's press release announcing the bylaw amendments is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.
Section 2.1. Annual Meetings.
Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, or the Lead Independent Director. Such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons
Section 2.2. Special Meetings.
 
Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than 10 days (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 2.3. Notice of Meetings.
Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 2.4. Adjournments.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of these By-laws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Section 2.5. Quorum.
Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in his absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be
Section 2.7. Voting; Proxies.
 
entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot; provided, however, that any election for directors must be by ballot if demanded by any stockholder at the meeting before the election has begun. Voting for the election of directors at any meeting of stockholders shall be as specified in Section 3.3 of these By-laws. All other matters presented to the stockholders for a vote, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting and (2) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Section 2.8. Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.
The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting
Section 2.9. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote.
 
is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of directors, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
In order for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not less than 120 days or more than 180 days prior to the first anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, then notice by the shareholder to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90

The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10, and if the Chairman should so determine he or she shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
Nothing in this Section 2.10 shall affect the right of a stockholder to request inclusion of a proposal in the Corporation's proxy statement to the extent that such right is provided by an applicable law.
No action that is required to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be effected by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting.
Section 2.11. No Action By Consent of Stockholders.
The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.

In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 3.1. General Powers.
The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, the number to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.
Section 3.2. Number; Qualifications.
At the first annual meeting of stockholders and at each annual meeting thereafter, the stockholders shall elect directors by a majority of the votes cast unless the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, in which case the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the shares
Section 3.3. Election; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies.
 
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares entitled to vote on the election of directors and represented in person or by proxy at such meeting casting their vote "for" a director must exceed the number of such votes cast "against" that director. If a nominee for director, who is not serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall not be elected. If a nominee for director, who is serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall then make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the reasons for it within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.
Each director shall hold office for a term of one year or until such time as his successor is elected and qualified. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at the election of directors. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. Any newly created directorship resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, failure to receive a majority of the votes cast at an election of directors, removal from office or any other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining members of the Board of Directors, though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced or until his successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the whole Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such times as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine, and if so determined notices thereof need not be given.
Section 3.4. Regular Meetings.

If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least 4 days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally or by

telephone or telegraph, it shall be delivered at least 48 hours before the time of the holding of the special meeting. If by facsimile transmission, such notice shall be transmitted at least 24 hours before the time of holding of the special meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of the special meeting or the place of the special meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal office of the Corporation.
Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Section 3.6. Telephonic Meetings Permitted.
At all meetings of the Board of Directors fifty percent (50%) of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except in cases in which the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws otherwise provide, the vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, then notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment in the manner specified in Section 3.5.
Section 3.7. Quorum; Vote Required for Action; Adjournment.
Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 3.8. Organization.
Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.
Section 3.9. Informal Action by Directors.
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. This Section 3.10 shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise and receiving compensation for those services.
Section 3.10. Fees and Compensation of Directors.
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the Corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the Corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the Corporation. To the extent permitted by applicable law, such loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the Corporation. Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the Corporation at common law or under any statutes.

Section 6.2. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New Certificates.
The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "proceeding") by reason of the fact that he, or a person for whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by such person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 7.1. Right to Indemnification.
The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that the payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII or otherwise.
Section 7.2. Prepayment of Expenses.
 
If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Article VII is not paid in full within 60 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.

Section 7.4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights.
The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit enterprise.

Section 8.2. Seal.
Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
Section 8.3. Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and Committees.
 
No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders.

Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account, and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs, or any other information storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a reasonable time.
Section 8.5. Form of Records.
These By-laws may be altered or repealed, and new By-laws made, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders may make additional by-laws and may alter and repeal any by-laws whether adopted by them or otherwise.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 13 2006, the company entered into a Severance Agreement, effective retroactively to November 30, 2005, with the company's Chief Executive Officer John Daane.
Under the severance provision of the Severance Agreement, Mr. Daane is entitled to receive payment equivalent to two years of his then current salary and one year of accelerated vesting of his stock options and restricted stock, unless specified otherwise in his option or restricted stock agreements. Mr. Daane would have one year from termination of employment to exercise any stock options for which vesting had been accelerated. The severance payments are payable only if the company terminates Mr. Daane for reasons other than his death or for cause, as defined in the Severance Agreement. Mr. Daane is not eligible for severance payments if he is eligible to receive benefits under the change in control portion of the Severance Agreement. Mr. Daane is not entitled to receive severance payments if he voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason. As a condition to receiving the severance payments, Mr. Daane must execute a release, releasing and waiving any claims he may have against the company.
Under the change in control provision of the Severance Agreement, Mr. Daane is entitled to receive severance compensation if within 24 months following a change in control one or more of the following events, referred to as "triggering events," occurs:
 
 
 
A change in control is generally defined as the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of either (1) the total combined voting power of the company's outstanding common stock or (2) the total fair market value of the company's common stock. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, Mr. Daane is entitled to receive the following compensation:
 
 
 
The Severance Agreement will terminate on November 30, 2010, unless earlier terminated as a result of a change in control.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Severance Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.30 to the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2006 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 27, 2006, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
., April 27, 2006  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced first quarter 2006 sales of $292.8 million, up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2005 and 11% from the first quarter of 2005. New product sales increased 28% sequentially and were up 173% from the prior year's first quarter.
San Jose, Calif
First quarter 2006 net income, on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, was $58.7 million, $0.16 per diluted share, compared with net income of $63.8 million, $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP net income, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense, was $73.0 million, $0.20 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2006.
Altera repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $43.7 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and investments.
"Led by Stratix II FPGAs, all of our new programmable devices set new sales records. Our new products were up more than 28% sequentially and drove Altera's first quarter sales growth. Based on cumulative sales, we remain the market-leading supplier of FPGAs introduced since 2002," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "We began shipping the 90-nm Stratix II GX FPGA family in March, ahead of schedule. We expect that the rest of the family will also arrive sooner than originally planned. We have met or exceeded our initial customer delivery commitments on all of our 90-nm device families, which further strengthens customer relationships and our competitive position."
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress:
 
 
 
 
Business Outlook for the Second Quarter 2006
Altera provides guidance on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Inclusion of stock-based compensation charges in GAAP-based operating expense adds significantly to the volatility of actual versus expected expense due to volatility in our stock price, which we cannot predict. Additionally, these forecasts assume that the impact of the company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan will be nil.
 
Conference Call and Quarterly Update:
A conference call will be held today at 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the quarter's results and management's outlook for the second quarter of 2006. The web cast and subsequent replay will be available in the investor relations section of the company's web site at http://www.altera.com. A telephonic replay of the call may be accessed later in the day by calling (719) 457-0820 and referencing confirmation code 258712. The telephonic replay will be available for two weeks following the live call.
Altera's second quarter business update will be issued in a press release available after the market close on May 30.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" as the term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as "will", "expects", "anticipates", or other words that imply or predict a future state. Forward-looking statements include any projection of revenue, gross margin, expense, or other financial items discussed in the Business Outlook section of this press release. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in
 
this release involve risks and uncertainty that can cause actual results to differ from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors, including without limitation, customer business environment, market acceptance of the company's products, the rate of growth of the company's new products including the Stratix II, Stratix II GX, Cyclone II, MAX II, and HardCopy device families, changes in the mix of our business between prototyping and production-based demand, as well as changes in economic conditions, and other risk factors discussed in documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. Copies of Altera's SEC filings are posted on the company's web site and are available from the company without charge. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as required by law, the company does not undertake an obligation to update its forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release and accompanying financial tables present non-GAAP financial information excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Altera believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with corresponding GAAP-based measures, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Altera's financial condition and results of operations. Altera management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, to review Altera's financial performance. Non-GAAP reporting represents relevant and useful information that is widely used by financial analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. Altera's management believes this presentation is useful to investors in evaluating performance on a basis that is consistent and comparable with periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Since stock-based compensation expense will not require cash payment by the company, the company's non-GAAP presentation, that excludes these expenses, may be a useful measure of the company's performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results is provided on page 5 of this release.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 8, 2006, Altera Corporation issued a press release to announce the initiation of an internal review by a special committee of its board of directors regarding Altera's historical stock option practices.
A copy of the press released is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

99.1 Press Release dated May 8, 2006

Date: May 8, 2006
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
., May 8, 2006 -- Altera Corporation (NASDAQ:ALTR) today announced that, as a result of management's recent review of the company's stock option practices, and issues concerning options granted during the period 1996 through 2000, the company's board of directors has established a special committee of independent directors to review the company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. The special committee will be assisted by independent legal counsel and outside accounting experts. Management initiated its review following recent media reports regarding stock option practices at other companies. Although the impact to the company's historical financial statements is not yet known, the company does not expect the review to result in material changes to its historical revenues or non-option related operating expenses. In light of this review, the company will not be able to file its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2006, which is due on May 10, 2006. The company is not seeking a five-day extension to file its Form 10-Q because it does not believe it can complete its review by the end of the allowed extension period. Altera does not anticipate that these developments will change the timing of its second quarter business update, currently scheduled for release after the market closes on May 30, 2006.
San Jose, Calif

Exhibit 99.1
 
.,  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ:ALTR) today announced the following related to the ongoing review of its historical stock option practices.
San Jose, Calif
May 25, 2006
SEC INQUIRY AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEY SUBPOENA
As previously announced, as a result of potential issues concerning stock options granted during the period 1996 through 2000 identified by Altera's management, the company's board of directors established a special committee of directors to review the company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. Altera notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the special committee's review and subsequently received notice that the SEC staff has opened an inquiry relating to this matter.
Altera Corporation also has received a subpoena from the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California relating to the granting of stock options.
Altera is cooperating with both agencies.
NASDAQ LISTING QUALIFICATION PANEL HEARING
Altera has requested a hearing in response to the recent NASDAQ Staff Determination notice indicating that Altera securities will be delisted from the NASDAQ stock market because of its failure to file its Quarterly Report Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2006. NASDAQ has notified Altera that a hearing has been granted and is scheduled for June 22, 2006. Altera's delisting is stayed pending the hearing. At the hearing, Altera will explain the reasons for the company's non-compliance with NASDAQ listing regulations and the company's proposed plan for regaining compliance. Once the hearing concludes, it may take up to several weeks for the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel to release its decision, and the delisting would be stayed pending that decision. There are also opportunities to seek an extension of time and to appeal NASDAQ's decision, if required.
SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION
Altera has been notified that two shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, by persons identifying themselves as Altera shareholders and purporting to act on behalf of Altera, naming Altera Corporation as a nominal defendant and naming some of the company's current and former officers and directors as defendants.
Cautionary Statement
There are a number of risks involved with the proceedings identified in this press release, as well as additional proceedings that Altera may face as a result of its recent announcements related to its stock option grants, and the outcome of its internal review, and we cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings. Investors are cautioned that Altera also faces the risks discussed in the company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2006. Copies of Altera's SEC filings are posted on the company's web site and are available from the company without charge. The statements made herein are made as of the date of this press release, and the company does not undertake an obligation to update these statements.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
May 30, 2006 - Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced its mid-quarter update for the second quarter of 2006.
San Jose, California,
The company reaffirms that second quarter sales will be in line with previous guidance for 7% to 10% sequential growth.
The company now expects up to several million dollars of additional SG&A expense in the second quarter resulting from its previously announced review of stock option granting practices and related accounting.
New products lead the company's growth with Stratix II, Cyclone
II, MAX II, and HardCopy devices all demonstrating continued strong sales increases.
While supply of certain types of Stratix, Stratix II, and HardCopy devices remain tight, the company believes that lead times for these parts will return to normal within one to three months, which is in line with previous company estimates.

Item 4.02(a). Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
As previously announced, the board of directors of Altera Corporation (the "Company") has established a special committee of independent directors to review the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. The special committee is being assisted by independent legal counsel and outside accounting experts. At this time, the special committee has not completed its work nor reached final conclusions and is continuing its review.
The special committee has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for certain stock option grants issued between 1996 and 2000 differ from the recorded grant dates for such awards. As a result, the Company expects to record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense in prior periods. The Company believes that these charges are material and, accordingly, expects to restate its financial statements for the fiscal years ended 1996 through 2005. The company has not yet determined the tax impact that may result from this matter. Because the special committee's review is still ongoing, there may be additional years subject to restatement.
Accordingly, on June 19, 2006, the Company's audit committee, after consultation with management and the special committee, determined that the Company's financial statements and any related reports of its independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended 1996 through 2005 should no longer be relied upon. The Company intends to file its restated financial statements and its quarterly report for the period ended March 31, 2006 as soon as practicable after the completion of the special committee's investigation.
The audit committee has discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a) with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. However, as the special committee's review has not been completed, the final conclusions of its review are not yet known to the independent registered public accounting firm.
Additionally, the Company is evaluating Management's Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2005. Although the Company has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of this situation on its internal controls over financial reporting, the Company has determined that it is likely that it had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2005. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financials will not be prevented or detected. If the Company were to conclude that a material weakness existed as of December 30, 2005, it would expect to receive an adverse opinion on internal control over financial reporting from its independent registered public accounting firm.
Any stock-based compensation charges incurred as a result of the restatement would have the effect of decreasing reported income or increasing reported loss from operations, decreasing reported net income or increasing reported net loss, and decreasing the reported retained earnings figures contained in the Company's historical financial statements for the periods mentioned above. The Company does not expect that the anticipated restatements will have any impact on its historical revenues.
A copy of the press release announcing the planned restatement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated in this Item 4.02 by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
., June 21, 2006  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ:ALTR) today announced that it expects to restate its previously issued financial statements to correct errors related to accounting for stock-based compensation expense.
San Jose, Calif
As previously announced, the company's board of directors has established a special committee of independent directors to review the company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. The special committee is being assisted by independent legal counsel and outside accounting experts. At this time, the special committee has not completed its work nor reached its final conclusions and is continuing its review.

Altera believes that these charges are material and, accordingly, expects to restate its financial statements for the fiscal years ended 1996 through 2005. The company has not yet determined the tax impact that may result from this matter. Based on information presently available, the company does not anticipate that the restatement will result in a material charge to fiscal year 2005. Because the special committee's review is still ongoing there may be additional years subject to restatement and the impact to fiscal year 2005 may be different than presently anticipated.
Accordingly, on June 19, 2006, the company's audit committee, after consultation with management and the special committee, determined that Altera's financial statements and any related reports of its independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended 1996 through 2005 should no longer be relied upon. Altera intends to file its restated financial statements and its quarterly report for the period ended March 31, 2006, as soon as practicable after the completion of the special committee's investigation.
The audit committee has discussed the above matters with the company's independent registered public accounting firm. However, as the special committee's review has not been completed, the final conclusions of its review are not yet known to the independent registered public accounting firm.
Additionally, Altera is evaluating Management's Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting set forth in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2005.

Altera does not expect that the anticipated restatement will have any impact on its historical revenues.
Altera expects to announce second quarter revenue results and third quarter revenue guidance on July 24, 2006. The company will not be in a position to announce additional financial results for the second quarter until the special committee has completed its investigation and the company has filed its restated financial statements and its quarterly report for the period ended March 31, 2006.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements concerning Altera's expected restatement of its historical financial statements, the filing of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2006, as well as Altera's review of its historical option practices. There can be no assurance concerning the outcome of the financial statement restatements, the filing of the first quarter Form 10-Q, or the special committee's review. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: the final conclusions of the special committee concerning matters relating to the company's stock option grants including, but not limited to, the accuracy of the stated dates of option grants and whether all proper corporate procedures were followed; and the impact of any restatement of financial statements of the company or other actions that may be taken or required as a result of such reviews. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this release also involve risks discussed in the company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2006. Copies of Altera's SEC filings are posted on the company's web site and are available from the company without charge. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as required by law, the company does not undertake an obligation to update its forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 24, 2006, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing its sales results for the second quarter of 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: July 24, 2006
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
., July 24, 2006  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced second quarter 2006 sales of $334.1 million, up 14% from the first quarter of 2006 and 17% from the second quarter of 2005. New product sales increased 50% sequentially and were up 139% from the prior year's second quarter. Additional financial results for the second quarter will be available as soon as practicable after the company's previously announced review of historical stock option practices and related accounting concludes.
San Jose, Calif
"Growth accelerated this quarter led by robust new product sales gains. Our largest growth contributor was the 90-nm Stratix II FPGA family, demonstrating our continued strong competitive position as a high-density FPGA supplier. We saw substantial growth as well from low-cost Cyclone II FPGAs and MAX II CPLDs. Our operations team and manufacturing partners performed superbly, allowing us to capitalize on rising demand for our products and respond to those customers we were not able to fully supply in the first quarter," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Our prior generation 130-nm FPGAs also contributed to the quarter's growth with combined sales of our high-density Stratix and Stratix GX devices up solidly from the prior quarter and the low-cost Cyclone family setting a new sales record."
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress:
 
 
 
Sales Outlook for the Third Quarter 2006
Altera expects that third quarter sales will be in the range of $334 million to $344 million.
Conference Call and Quarterly Update:
A conference call will be held today at 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the quarter's sales and management's sales outlook for the third quarter of 2006. The web cast and subsequent replay will be available in the investor relations section of the company's web site at http://www.altera.com. A telephonic replay of the call may be accessed later in the day by calling (719) 457-0820 and referencing confirmation code 258712. The telephonic replay will be available for two weeks following the live call.
Altera's third quarter business update will be issued in a press release available after the market close on September 5, 2006.
 
Stock Option Practices Review, NASDAQ Listing Update, and Second Quarter Form 10-Q
As announced on June 21, 2006, Altera expects to restate its previously issued financial statements to correct errors related to accounting for stock-based compensation expense. The additional non-cash stock-based compensation charges will require the restatement of financial statements for the fiscal years 1996 to 2005, although the company does not anticipate a material charge to 2005. It is not anticipated that these restatements will affect the accounting for current or prior period sales. The special committee of independent board members has not completed its work and, with the assistance of legal counsel and outside accounting experts, is continuing its review of Altera's historic stock option practices and related accounting.
As a result of the on-going stock option review, Altera has not filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2006. Consequently, the company received a Staff Determination Letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that the company's securities were subject to delisting unless the company requested a hearing before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel. The company requested a hearing and on June 22, 2006 presented its plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ listing regulations to the Panel. The Panel has not yet issued its decision. There can be no assurance that the NASDAQ Panel will grant the company's request for continued listing on NASDAQ.
Because the special committee's review is ongoing, Altera does not expect to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2006 by the date required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Altera has informed NASDAQ of this anticipated filing delay.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" as the term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as "will", "expects", "anticipates", or other words that imply or predict a future state. Forward-looking statements include any projection of sales discussed in the Sales Outlook section of this press release, the effect of the options review on the company's financial statements, and the anticipated Form 10-Q filing delay. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this release involve risks and uncertainty that can cause actual results to differ from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors, including without limitation, the outcome of Altera's hearing before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, the results of the review of the company's stock option practices, customer business environment, market acceptance of the company's products, the rate of growth of the company's new products including the Stratix II, Cyclone II, MAX II, and HardCopy device families, changes in the mix of our business between prototyping and production-based demand, as well as changes in economic conditions, and other risk factors discussed in documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. Copies of Altera's SEC
 
filings are posted on the company's web site and are available from the company without charge. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as required by law, the company does not undertake an obligation to update its forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On September 5, 2006, Altera Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that although the special committee of the Company's board of directors (the "Special Committee") has not yet reached its final conclusions, it has preliminarily identified certain stock option grants issued from December 1996 through March 2001 where the grant date differed from the recorded measurement date. The Company anticipates recording additional non-cash stock-based compensation charges of approximately $18 million, pre-tax, in connection with these stock option grants.
Based on the preliminary work completed by the Company's management, which the Special Committee has not analyzed to date, the Company anticipates recording additional non-cash stock-based compensation charges of approximately $20$30 million, pre-tax, in connection with additional stock-based compensation charges arising from the modification of certain employees' stock option agreements in connection with the termination of their employment, as discussed further in Item 8.01 below.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the tax impact of the aforementioned adjustments, including additional tax provisions primarily related to limitations on deductibility for certain executive compensation. The estimated aggregate pre-tax charge of $38$48 million will result in a restatement of the Company's previously issued financial statements. Based on the information presently available, the Company does not anticipate that the restatement will result in a material charge to the statement of operations for its fiscal year ended 2005. The Company does not expect that the anticipated restatement will have any impact on the Company's historical revenue.
The press release announcing the Company's preliminary conclusions is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
The Company also announced in its September 5, 2006 press release that it has requested an extension of its NASDAQ deadline through October 26, 2006, primarily to allow the Special Committee additional time to complete its review concerning additional stock-based compensation charges arising from the modification of certain employees' stock option agreements in connection with the termination of their employment. The Company requested this extension from the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") and will report the Panel's response promptly after receipt of written notice of the response.
As previously announced, the Panel granted the Company's request for continued listing of the Company's securities on The NASDAQ Global Market subject to certain conditions, including the following: (1) filing of the Company's Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2006, as well as any necessary restatements, on or before September 14, 2006; (2) filing of the Company's Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2006 on or before September 28, 2006; and (3) submission of additional information regarding the Company's internal review of its historical stock option practices and related accounting.
The press release announcing the Company's request for an additional NASDAQ extension is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements concerning the Company's request for a further extension of time to regain compliance from the Panel, the preliminary results of the Special Committee's review of the Company's historical option practices, management's preliminary conclusions regarding (i) the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation charges, and (ii) recording of the tax effect including tax provisions primarily related to limitations on deductibility for certain executive compensation. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this release involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those currently anticipated, including, without limitation, the Panel's response to the Company's request for a further extension, the final results of the Special Committee's review, inaccuracies in management's preliminary conclusions regarding the above-mentioned tax and accounting matters and other risks discussed in the company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2006. Copies of the Company's SEC filings are posted on the Company's web site and are available from the Company without charge.

Date: September 5, 2006
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
., September 5, 2006  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced that it has filed a revised plan of compliance with the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, pursuant to which it requested an extension of time in which to complete and file its required periodic reports. The company has requested this extension through October 26, 2006 to file its Form 10-K/A for the period ended December 30, 2005, its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2006, and its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2006. The extension would allow continued listing of Altera's securities on The NASDAQ Global Market pending the filing of the periodic reports on or before the extended deadline. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant Altera's extension request or that Altera will be in a position to meet any new deadlines established by the Panel.
San Jose, Calif
As previously announced, the company's board of directors has established a special committee of independent directors to review the company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. The special committee is being assisted by independent legal counsel and outside accounting experts.
Although the special committee has not yet reached its final conclusions, it has preliminarily identified certain stock option grants issued from December 1996 through March 2001 where the grant date differed from the recorded measurement date. The company anticipates recording additional non-cash stock-based compensation charges of approximately $18 million, pre-tax, in connection with these stock option grants.
Altera's request for an extension from the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel arises primarily out of the special committee's need for additional time to complete its review concerning additional stock-based compensation charges arising from the modification of certain employees' stock option agreements in connection with the termination of their employment. Based on the preliminary work on this issue completed by management, which the special committee has not analyzed to date, the company anticipates recording additional non-cash stock-based compensation charges of approximately $20 - $30 million, pre-tax.
The company is in the process of evaluating the tax impact of the aforementioned adjustments, including additional tax provisions primarily related to limitations on deductibility for certain executive compensation. The estimated aggregate pre-tax charge of $38$48 million will result in a restatement of the company's previously issued financial statements. Based on the information presently available, the company does not anticipate that the restatement will result in a material charge to the statement of operations for its fiscal year ended 2005. The company does not expect that the anticipated restatement will have any impact on the company's historical revenue.

In granting the extension, the Panel has required that through October 26, 2006, Altera notify the Panel of the occurrence of any significant events, including any event that may call into question Altera's historical financial information or impact the company's ability to comply with any NASDAQ listing requirement or satisfy the October 26, 2006 deadline. In addition, any submissions to the Panel, press releases, or public filings prepared by Altera will be subject to review by the Panel, which may, at its discretion, request additional information before determining that Altera has complied with the terms of the Panel's decision. The Panel also stated that it only has the discretion to grant an extension to October 26, 2006. If Altera is unable to comply with the conditions for continued listing required by the Panel, the company's securities will be subject to immediate delisting from the NASDAQ Global Market. Altera would have the option to request that the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council review any decision to delist its shares from the NASDAQ Global Market, but the company cannot provide any assurance that such a request would be successful. A request for review would not stay a Panel decision to delist the company's shares. Altera's previously-announced special committee review of the company's historical stock option practices and related accounting and other matters is ongoing.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 16, 2006, Altera Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that the Company has completed its review of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting.
Altera had previously announced that, as a result of the special committee's review, the Company expected to restate prior financial statements to correct errors related to accounting for stock-based compensation expense. In addition, the Company previously announced that it would record an estimated pre-tax charge of $18 million relating to stock option grant measurement date errors and $20-30 million related to modifications of stock option agreements and that the restatement would not affect historical revenues or the 2005 income statement.
The Company expects these restatement adjustments will total $47.6 million (pre-tax) and relate primarily to (1) stock option grant measurement date errors from December 1996 through February 2001 ($17.8 million), (2) stock option grant agreement modifications from 1996 to 2002 in connection with the termination of certain employees' employment ($24.3 million), and (3) other adjustments ($5.5 million), principally related to the accounting for the Company's service award program. The Company anticipates a $12.4 million tax benefit arising from the cumulative restatement adjustments resulting in a net income restatement impact of $35.2 million.
The effects of the restatement will not be material to the results of operations for fiscal year 2005 or affect any historical revenues.
Several key findings and additional details related to the special committee's review are described in the press release.
A copy of the press release announcing the matters discussed in this Item 2.02 is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
On October 16, 2006, the Company issued an additional press release announcing that Nathan Sarkisian, its Chief Financial Officer, has retired from the Company and that James W. Callas has assumed the roles of Principal Financial and Accounting Officer and acting Chief Financial Officer. The Company also announced that a search for Mr. Sarkisian's permanent replacement is ongoing. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On October 16, 2006, the Company issued a press release announcing the following:
NASDAQ Filing Deadline Expected to be Met
The Company announced that it expects to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 10-K/A for 2005 and Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2006 by October 26, 2006, the deadline established by a NASDAQ Listing Panel.
Material Weakness Determination
The Company also announced that management has concluded that because of improved controls since February 2001, as well as personnel changes, there was no material weakness as of December 30, 2005 with respect to stock option grant date accounting.
In addition, although there were no material modifications to stock option grant agreements after 2002 that would have required the Company to record additional pre-tax, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, management has concluded that as of December 30, 2005, the Company had a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting with respect to the modifications of stock option grant agreements in connection with termination of employment. The Company's 2005 Form 10-K/A will further describe the material weakness along with planned remedial actions that are being taken, which include searching for a new Chief Financial Officer and improved controls and training.
Additional details relating to material weakness determination are described in the press release.
Second Quarter Results
The Company also announced that since the Company previously has disclosed only revenue results for the second quarter of 2006, at the time the second quarter Form 10-Q is filed, the Company will issue an earnings release and host a conference call to provide additional commentary about the quarter's results. Access information for this event will be included in a press release issued when the second quarter Form 10-Q is filed.
Third Quarter Results
The Company expects to release its third quarter financial results on November 6, 2006, after market close and will host a conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific Time to review the quarter's results and business outlook.
A copy of the press release announcing the matters discussed in this Item 8.01 is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements concerning the expected filing date of the Company's required periodic reports, the Company's expectations regarding (i) the description and amount of non-cash stock-based compensation charges, (ii) the effects of the restatement on past results of operations and revenues, and (iii) the amount of the tax benefit and recording of the tax effect. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this report involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those currently anticipated, including, without limitation, delays in filing the Company's required periodic reports, inaccuracies in the Company's expectations regarding the above-mentioned tax and accounting matters and other risks discussed in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2006 and in the Company's other current and periodic reports filed from time to time with the SEC. Copies of the Company's SEC filings are posted on the Company's web site and are available from the Company without charge.

Date: October 24, 2006
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
., October 24, 2006  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ:ALTR) today announced second quarter 2006 net income, on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, of $77.3 million, $0.21 per diluted share, compared with net income of $67.6 million, $0.18 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, was $91.0 million, $0.25 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006.
SAN JOSE, Calif
The company had previously announced second quarter revenues of $334.1 million, up 14 percent from the first quarter of 2006 and 17 percent from the second quarter of 2005. New product sales increased 49 percent sequentially and were up 138 percent from the prior year's second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, second quarter gross margin was 66.1 percent and operating expenses were $140.7 million. Excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 66.2 percent and operating expenses were $122.5 million.
Prior to the temporary suspension of its share repurchase program in May 2006, Altera repurchased 448,000 shares of its common stock during the second quarter at a cost of $9.4 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments.
Altera's 2005 Form 10-K/A, first quarter Form 10-Q, and second quarter Form 10-Q are also being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.
"With today's SEC filings we will have completed the restatement we previously announced and become current in our periodic reports. We have taken steps to ensure that Altera's financial reporting is as it should be: accurate, transparent, timely, and compliant with applicable accounting standards," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "I want to apologize to our shareholders for the past events that resulted in the need to restate historical financial statements. We are committed to investing in ongoing efforts to continuously improve our internal controls and to remediate the material weakness identified in our SEC reports."
Conference Call
A conference call will be held today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the second quarter's results. To participate in the conference call, dial (785) 832-2422 (use access code 7292741).

The telephonic replay will be available for two weeks following the live call.
Third Quarter Results
Third quarter results are currently scheduled to be released November 6, 2006 after the market close.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" as the term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as "will", "expects", "anticipates", or other words that imply or predict a future state. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to today's filing of Altera's periodic reports with the SEC, the timing of our third quarter earnings release, the adequacy of Altera's subsequent periodic reports, and Altera's efforts to improve internal controls and remediate an identified material weakness in the company's internal controls. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this release involve risks and uncertainty that can cause actual results to differ from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors, including without limitation, technical difficulties with the SEC and EDGAR system, a delay in the release of our third quarter earnings or future periodic reports, judgments required in the application of accounting standards, and delays or difficulties in improvement of our internal controls or remediation of the company's material weakness, as well as other risk factors discussed in documents filed by the company with the SEC from time to time. Copies of Altera's SEC filings are posted on the company's web site and are available from the company without charge. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as required by law, the company does not undertake an obligation to update its forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this release and accompanying financial tables contain non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the effects of the non-cash stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effects of SFAS 123 (R), "Share-based Payment." The non-GAAP financial measures are neither in accordance with, nor an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Accordingly, the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below should be carefully evaluated. Altera believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, when shown in conjunction with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Altera's financial condition and results of operations. Altera management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, to review Altera's financial performance. Non-GAAP reporting represents relevant and useful information that is widely used by financial analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. Altera's management believes this presentation is useful to investors in evaluating performance on a
basis that is consistent and comparable with periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Since expensing stock-based compensation expense does not require cash expenditures by the company, the company's non-GAAP presentation that excludes these expenses may be a useful measure of the company's performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results is provided on pages 4 to 6 of this release.

On November 6, 2006, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
, November 6, 2006  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced third quarter 2006 sales of $341.2 million, up 2 percent from the second quarter of 2006 and 17 percent from the third quarter of 2005. New product sales increased 26 percent sequentially and were up 142 percent from the prior year's third quarter.
San Jose, Calif.
 
Third quarter 2006 net income, on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, was $87.4 million, $0.24 per diluted share, compared with net income of $77.8 million, $0.21 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP net income, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense, was $97.8 million, $0.27 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006.
 
As previously announced, Altera temporarily suspended its stock repurchase program in May 2006. As a consequence, the company did not repurchase shares during the third quarter. Altera ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and investments.
 
"Healthy new product growth in the third quarter continues to demonstrate the appeal of our leading edge devices. All of the products in this category, including the HardCopy
device family, grew sequentially and set new sales records," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Altera's new product success over the past several years rests on unique programmable logic innovation that increases the attractiveness of our solutions and continues to add to our competitive strength."
 
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress:
 
 
In recognizing Altera, Huawei also noted Altera's overall quality and supply chain management. Delivering high levels of customer responsiveness is a key element in Altera's customer-centered business strategy and a significant contributor to Altera's FPGA market share gains over the past several years.
 
 
Business Outlook for the Fourth Quarter 2006
 
Altera provides guidance on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Inclusion of stock-based compensation charges in GAAP-based operating expense adds significantly to the volatility of actual versus expected expense due to volatility in our stock price, which we cannot predict. Additionally, these forecasts assume that the impact of the company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan will be nil.
 
 
Conference Call and Quarterly Update:
 
A conference call will be held today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the quarter's results and management's outlook for the fourth quarter of 2006.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On December 5, 2006, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing a business update for the fourth quarter. A copy of the business update is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: December 5, 2006
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
., December 5, 2006  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced its mid-quarter update for the fourth quarter of 2006.
San Jose, Calif
The company now expects that fourth quarter sales will be 5 to 7 percent lower than the third quarter of 2006. Previous guidance had been for a 2 to 5 percent decline.
Quarter-to-date sales of Altera's new products continue to improve, although the company's mainstream and mature product sales have declined. As anticipated, customers are reducing FPGA inventory leading to slower FPGA sales quarter-to-date, and sales to the wireless infrastructure market remain weak.
Altera continues to expect that sequential sales growth will resume in the first quarter of 2007.

Mr. Berlan joined Altera in December 1989 as vice president, product engineering and was named vice president, operations and product engineering in October 1994.

"Leading and encouraging the innovative spirit of Altera engineers through the years has been the most gratifying part of my long career with the company," said Mr. Berlan. "I am very proud of the results we have achieved together; developing and manufacturing highly innovative products ranging from 1 micron to 45-nm technology.

On February 13, 2007, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
, February 13, 2007  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced 2006 sales of $1.29 billion, up 14%, compared with $1.12 billion in 2005. New product sales increased 150 percent. Net income for 2006 was $323.2 million, $0.88 per diluted share, versus net income of $278.8 million, $0.74 per diluted share, in 2005. Non-GAAP net income in 2006, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense, was $371.2 million, $1.01 per diluted share.
San Jose, Calif.
 
Fourth quarter sales were $317.4 million, up 13 percent from the fourth quarter of 2005 and down 7 percent from the third quarter of 2006. Fourth quarter net income was $99.9 million, $0.27 per diluted share, up 43 percent compared with net income of $69.7 million, $0.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005. Gross profit margin was 66.3 percent for the fourth quarter of 2006 versus 66.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
During the fourth quarter, Altera reduced its 2006 effective tax rate from 15 percent to 10 percent resulting in a net income benefit of $18 million or $0.05 per diluted share. The tax benefit in the fourth quarter arose primarily from the reinstatement in December 2006 of the federal R&D tax credit and the favorable impact of a tax audit settlement.
 
Altera repurchased 7.1 million shares of its common stock during 2006 at a cost of $140.4 million, with 4.4 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $87.4 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and investments.
 
"Our 2006 results show an acceleration in top line growth for Altera as we once again outpaced semiconductor industry growth. We aim to capitalize on this momentum and drive for additional sales growth and market share gains. Our overall financial performance remained very strong with profitability that puts us at the top of the programmable logic industry," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "We are in the final development stage for our high-end Stratix III FPGA devices and are completing work on several new products that we will introduce in 2007, making 2007 a very ambitious year for us. We are confident that we can extend our record of smooth new product roll-outs, and that we will be well positioned to compete for the substantial growth opportunity available to the programmable logic industry."
 
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress.
 
 
 
 
Business Outlook for the First Quarter 2007
 
The following guidance includes stock-based compensation expense in cost of goods sold, research and development, and SG&A of $0.4 million, $6 million, and $8 million respectively. The tax rate would be 2 percentage points higher excluding stock-based compensation.
 
 
Conference Call and Quarterly Update:
 
A conference call will be held today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the quarter's results and management's outlook for the first quarter of 2007.

Forward-Looking Statements
 
Statements in this press release that are not historical are "forward-looking statements" as the term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as "will", "expects", "anticipates", or other words that imply or predict a future state. Forward-looking statements include any projection of revenue, gross margin, expense or other financial items discussed in the Business Outlook section of this press release and comments relating to new products and anticipated product rollouts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this release involve risks and uncertainty that can cause actual results to differ from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors, including without limitation, customer business environment, market acceptance of the company's products, the rate of growth of the company's new products including the Stratix III, Stratix II, Stratix II GX, Cyclone
II, MAX II and HardCopy device families, changes in the mix of our business between prototyping and production-based demand, as well as changes in economic conditions and other risk factors discussed in documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. Copies of Altera's SEC filings are posted on the company's web site and are available from the company without charge. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as required by law, the company does not undertake an obligation to update its forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the accompanying financial tables contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of the non-cash stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effects of SFAS 123 (R), "Share-based Payment." The non-GAAP financial measures are neither in accordance with, nor an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Accordingly, the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below should be carefully evaluated. Altera believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, when shown in conjunction with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Altera's financial condition and results of operations. Altera management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, to review Altera's financial performance. Non-GAAP reporting represents relevant and useful information that is widely used by financial analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. Altera's management believes this presentation is useful to investors in evaluating performance on a basis that is consistent and comparable with periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Since expensing stock-based compensation expense does not require cash expenditures by the company, the company's non-GAAP presentation that excludes these expenses may be a useful measure of the company's performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results is provided on pages 5 to 7 of this release.

Since the initiation of the company's share repurchase program in 1996, Altera has repurchased 101 million shares at a cost of $2.1 billion.

The Board of Directors of Altera Corporation (the "Company") amended and restated the Company's By-laws (the "By-laws"), effective as of July 11, 2007. Article VI of the By-laws was amended to provide for the issuance of uncertificated shares. The ability to issue uncertificated shares allows the Company to participate in the Direct Registration System, which is currently administered by The Depository Trust Company. The Direct Registration System permits investors to have securities registered in their names without the issuance of physical certificates and allows investors to electronically transfer securities to broker-dealers in order to effect transactions without the risks and delays associated with transferring physical certificates. The full text of the By-laws, as amended and restated, is filed as Exhibit 3.2 hereto, and amended Article VI thereof is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Dated: July 16, 2007
 

Exhibit 3.2
 
 
 
The principal office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware shall be located in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, and the name and address of its registered agent is Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, Delaware 19808.
Section 1.1 Delaware Office.
The Corporation may have such other offices, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may designate or as the business of the Corporation may from time to time require.
Section 1.2. Other Offices.
The books and records of the Corporation may be kept at the Corporation's headquarters in San Jose, California or at such other locations outside the State of Delaware as may from time to time be designated by the Board of Directors.
Section 1.3. Books and Records.
An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time. Only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the annual meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.
Section 2.1. Annual Meetings.
Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, or the Lead Independent Director. Such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.
Section 2.2. Special Meetings.
 
Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than 10 days (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 2.3. Notice of Meetings.
Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 2.4. Adjournments.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of these By-laws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Section 2.5. Quorum.
Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in his absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 2.6. Organization.
 
Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot; provided, however, that any election for directors must be by ballot if demanded by any stockholder at the meeting before the election has begun. Voting for the election of directors at any meeting of stockholders shall be as specified in Section 3.3 of these Bylaws. All other matters presented to the stockholders for a vote, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.
Section 2.7. Voting; Proxies.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting and (2) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Section 2.8. Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.
The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time
Section 2.9. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote.
 
and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of directors, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
In order for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not less than 120 days or more than 180 days prior to the first anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, then notice by the shareholder to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90
Section 2.10. Stockholder Proposals at Annual Meetings.
th
day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 15
th
day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business the stockholder desires to bring before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.
The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10, and if the Chairman should so determine he or she shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
Nothing in this Section 2.10 shall affect the right of a stockholder to request inclusion of a proposal in the Corporation's proxy statement to the extent that such right is provided by an applicable law.
No action that is required to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be effected by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting.
Section 2.11. No Action By Consent of Stockholders.
The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are
Section 2.12. Conduct of Meetings.
 
appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
The Board of Directors by resolution may appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed to act, or if all inspectors or alternates who have been appointed are unable to act, at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting.
Section 2.13 Inspectors of Elections; Opening and Closing the Polls.
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 3.1. General Powers.
The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, the number to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.
Section 3.2. Number; Qualifications.
At the first annual meeting of stockholders and at each annual meeting thereafter, the stockholders shall elect directors by a majority of the votes cast unless the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, in which case the directors shall be elected by a
Section 3.3. Election; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies.
 
plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares entitled to vote on the election of directors and represented in person or by proxy at such meeting casting their vote "for" a director must exceed the number of such votes cast "against" that director. If a nominee for director, who is not serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall not be elected. If a nominee for director, who is serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall then make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the reasons for it within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.
Each director shall hold office for a term of one year or until such time as his successor is elected and qualified. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at the election of directors. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. Any newly created directorship resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, failure to receive a majority of the votes cast at an election of directors, removal from office or any other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining members of the Board of Directors, though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced or until his successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the whole Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such times as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine, and if so determined notices thereof need not be given.
Section 3.4. Regular Meetings.
Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Lead Independent Director, or any two members of the Board of Directors.

If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least 4 days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph, it shall be delivered at least 48
Section 3.5. Special Meetings.
 
hours before the time of the holding of the special meeting. If by facsimile transmission, such notice shall be transmitted at least 24 hours before the time of holding of the special meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of the special meeting or the place of the special meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal office of the Corporation.
Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Section 3.6. Telephonic Meetings Permitted.
At all meetings of the Board of Directors fifty percent (50%) of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except in cases in which the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws otherwise provide, the vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, then notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment in the manner specified in Section 3.5.
Section 3.7. Quorum; Vote Required for Action; Adjournment.
Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting.

Section 3.8. Organization.
Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.
Section 3.9. Informal Action by Directors.
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. This Section 3.10 shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise and receiving compensation for those services.
Section 3.10. Fees and Compensation of Directors.
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the Corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the Corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the Corporation. To the extent permitted by applicable law, such loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the Corporation. Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the Corporation at common law or under any statutes.
Section 3.11. Approval of Loans to Officers.
The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.
Section 4.1. Committees.
Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, each committee designated by the Board of Directors may make, alter and repeal rules for the conduct of its business.

Section 4.2. Committee Rules.
The officers of the Corporation shall be a president, a secretary, and a chief financial officer. The Corporation may also have, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a chairman of the board, one or more vice presidents, one or more assistant secretaries, one or more assistant treasurers, and such other officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 of these By-laws.

Section 5.2. Election of Officers.
The Board of Directors may appoint, or may empower the president to appoint, such other officers as the business of the Corporation may require, each of whom shall hold office for such period, have such authority, and perform such duties as are provided in these By-laws or as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.
Section 5.3. Subordinate Officers.
Subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment, any officer may be removed, either with or without cause, by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting of the board or, except in case of an officer chosen by the Board of Directors, by any officer upon whom such power of removal may be conferred by the Board of Directors.
Section 5.4. Removal and Resignation of Officers.
Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.
A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause shall be filled in the manner prescribed in these By-laws for regular appointments to that office.
Section 5.5. Vacancies in Offices.

Section 5.6. Chairman of the Board.
Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as may be given by the Board of Directors to the chairman of the board, if there be such an officer, the president shall be the chief executive officer of the Corporation and shall, subject to the control of the Board of Directors, have general supervision, direction, and control of the business and the officers of the Corporation. He shall preside at all meetings of the shareholders and, in the absence or nonexistence of a chairman of the board, at all meetings of the Board of Directors.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan

included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(ii) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c) . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(b) . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender, or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

Delay in Requests
provided
 
. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.

SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY
"Guarantor"
"Guarantors"
"Guarantied Party"
"Lenders"
A. Altera Corporation, a Delaware corporation (), has entered into that certain Credit Agreement dated as of August 31, 2007 with Lenders and Guarantied Party, as Administrative Agent for Lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent (said Credit Agreement, as it may hereafter be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, being the ; capitalized terms defined therein and not otherwise defined herein being used herein as therein defined).
"Company"
"Credit Agreement"
B. Guarantied Party and Lenders are sometimes referred to herein as .
"Beneficiaries"
C. A portion of the proceeds of the Loans may be advanced to other Guarantors that are Subsidiaries of Company, and thus the Guarantied Obligations (as hereinafter defined) are being incurred for and will inure to the benefit of Guarantors (which benefits are hereby acknowledged).
D. Guarantors are willing irrevocably and unconditionally to guaranty such obligations of Company.
based upon the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in order to induce Lenders and Guarantied Party to make Loans and other extensions of credit thereunder, Guarantors hereby agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE,
(a) Guarantors jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally guaranty, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, the due and punctual payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations (as hereinafter defined) when the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code). The term is used herein in its most comprehensive sense and includes any and all Obligations of Company, now or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, whether due or not due, and however arising under or in connection with the Credit Agreement, this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents, including those arising under successive borrowing transactions
1. Guaranty.
"Guarantied Obligations"
 
under the Credit Agreement which shall either continue the Obligations of Company or from time to time renew them after they have been satisfied.
Each Guarantor acknowledges that a portion of the Loans may be advanced to it and that the Guarantied Obligations are being incurred for and will inure to its benefit.
Any interest on any portion of the Guarantied Obligations that accrues after the commencement of any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of Company (or, if interest on any portion of the Guarantied Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of said proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guarantied Obligations if said proceeding had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guarantied Obligations because it is the intention of each Guarantor and Guarantied Party that the Guarantied Obligations should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order that may relieve Company of any portion of such Guarantied Obligations.
In the event that all or any portion of the Guarantied Obligations is paid by Company, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) is rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from Guarantied Party or any other Beneficiary as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments that are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guarantied Obligations.
Subject to the other provisions of this Section 1, upon the failure of Company to pay any of the Guarantied Obligations when and as the same shall become due, each Guarantor will upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to Guarantied Party for the ratable benefit of Beneficiaries, an amount equal to the aggregate of the unpaid Guarantied Obligations.
(b) Anything contained in this Guaranty to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the ), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Guarantor (x) in respect of intercompany indebtedness to Company or other affiliates of Company to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder and (y) under any guaranty of subordinated indebtedness which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this Section 1(b), pursuant to which the liability of such Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution of such Guarantor pursuant to applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement.
"Fraudulent Transfer Laws"
 
(c) Each Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each guarantor under other guaranties, if any, relating to the Credit Agreement (the ) that contain a contribution provision similar to that set forth in this Section 1(c), together desire to allocate among themselves (collectively, the ), in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty and the Related Guaranties. Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by a Guarantor under this Guaranty or a guarantor under a Related Guaranty, each such Guarantor or such other guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other Contributing Guarantors in the maximum amount permitted by law so as to maximize the aggregate amount of the Guarantied Obligations paid to Beneficiaries.
"Related Guaranties"
"Contributing Guarantors"
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees that: (a) this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due and not of collectibility; (b) Guarantied Party may enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between Company and any Beneficiary with respect to the existence of such event; (c) the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of Company under the Loan Documents and the obligations of any other guarantor of obligations of Company and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against Company or any of such other guarantors and whether or not Company is joined in any such action or actions; and (d) a payment of a portion, but not all, of the Guarantied Obligations by one or more Guarantors shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge the liability of such or any other Guarantor for any portion of the Guarantied Obligations that has not been paid.

omissions in the administration of the Guarantied Obligations, except behavior that amounts to bad faith; (e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, that are or might be in conflict with the terms of this Guaranty and any legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantor's obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and (iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Beneficiary protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto; (f) notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of this Guaranty, notices of default under the Credit Agreement, or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to Company and notices of any of the matters referred to in Sections 3 and 4 and any right to consent to any thereof; (g) any defense related to any decree or order of any jurisdiction; and (h) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of this Guaranty.
As used in this paragraph, any reference to "the principal" includes Company, and any reference to "the creditor" includes Guarantied Party and each other Beneficiary. In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code (a) each Guarantor waives any and all rights and defenses available to it by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code. No other provision of this Guaranty shall be construed as limiting the generality of any of the covenants and waivers set forth in this paragraph. As provided below, this Guaranty shall be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. This paragraph is included solely out of an abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the above-referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to this Guaranty or to any of the Guarantied Obligations.
Until the Guarantied Obligations (other than Unasserted Obligations) shall have been paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated, each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of (a) any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Company or any of its assets in connection with this Guaranty or the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute (including without limitation under California Civil Code Section 2847, 2848 or 2849), under common law or otherwise and including without limitation (i) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Company, (ii) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy that any Beneficiary now has or may hereafter have against Company, and (iii) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary and (b) any right of contribution such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against any other guarantor of any of the Guarantied Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such
6. Guarantors' Rights of Subrogation, Contribution, Etc.; Subordination of Other Obligations.
 
Guarantor may have against Company or against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution such Guarantor may have against any such other guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights Guarantied Party or the other Beneficiaries may have against Company, to all right, title and interest Guarantied Party or the other Beneficiaries may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right Guarantied Party or the other Beneficiaries may have against such other guarantor.
Any indebtedness of Company now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantied Obligations, and any such indebtedness of Company to a Guarantor collected or received by such Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and any amount paid to a Guarantor on account of any subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights referred to in the preceding paragraph when all Guarantied Obligations have not been paid in full, shall be held in trust for Guarantied Party on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to Guarantied Party for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations.
Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay, or cause to be paid, on demand, and to save Guarantied Party and the other Beneficiaries and their respective Affiliates harmless against liability for, (i) any and all costs and expenses (including fees, costs of settlement, and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) incurred or expended by Guarantied Party or any other Beneficiary in connection with the enforcement of or preservation of any rights under this Guaranty and (ii) any and all costs and expenses (including those arising from rights of indemnification) required to be paid by Guarantors under the provisions of any other Loan Document.

Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from Company on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of Company and its ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents, and each Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of Company and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations.

pertain to this Guaranty or any other Loan Document, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (B) either individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

On October 23, 2007, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing a business update for the third quarter. A copy of the business update is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
., October 23, 2007  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced third quarter 2007 sales of $315.8 million, down 1 percent from the second quarter of 2007 and down 7 percent from the third quarter of 2006. New products grew 13 percent sequentially.
San Jose, Calif
Third quarter 2007 net income was $69.0 million, $0.20 per diluted share, compared with net income of $87.4 million, $0.24 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006.
Altera repurchased 10.8 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $255 million. As of the end of the third quarter, Altera has, year to date, repurchased 32 million shares at a cost of $717 million. Repurchases in 2007 are part of a previously announced plan to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the company's common stock through 2007 and the first half of 2008. Altera ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share payable on December 3, 2007 to shareholders of record on November 12, 2007.
"The September quarter proved more challenging than anticipated. Sales to the communications and industrial markets were below expectations, although consumer market segment sales were up strongly. The resulting end market mix reduced gross margin this quarter. Reflecting continued cost control efforts across the company, operating expenses came in lower than forecast, more than offsetting the lower than planned gross margin," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "New product sales once again generated good double digit sequential growth and are now 35 percent of sales. With the Stratix III FPGA family now shipping, we are the only programmable logic company with 65-nm devices optimized for low power, which gives us a unique competitive position at the leading edge of FPGA deployment. The Stratix III introduction is going smoothly, and we anticipate rapid customer adoption."
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress:

Impacted office lease locations include San Diego and Santa Cruz, California, Ottawa, Canada and Hong Kong (PRC).

On December 5, 2007, the Company issued a press release announcing a business update for the fourth quarter of 2007. A copy of the business update is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
., December 5, 2007  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced its mid-quarter update for the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, and as part of the company's ongoing operating expense reduction efforts, several restructuring steps are being announced.
San Jose, Calif
The company reaffirms that it expects fourth quarter sales to be flat to 4 percent lower compared to the third quarter of 2007, in line with prior guidance. Sales into the communications market are somewhat stronger than earlier guidance, while sales into the consumer market are somewhat weaker than anticipated. As expected, the company's new product category is showing growth in comparison to the similar period in the prior quarter.
Altera has repurchased 22.4 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at a cost of $442 million. Altera has, year to date, repurchased 54.5 million shares at a cost of $1.16 billion. Repurchases in 2007 are part of a previously announced plan to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the company's common stock through 2007 and the first half of 2008. The company now expects that fourth quarter diluted share count will be in the range of 335 million shares. Other income is now anticipated to be approximately $11 million.
Altera will incur restructuring charges of $4-6 million in the fourth quarter as a result of lease terminations and modifications and the elimination of approximately 65 positions from the company's 2,700 person workforce. The company estimates that annual savings from this restructuring will be approximately $10 million per year.

(e) The following is a description of the Altera Corporation ("Altera") 2008 Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") provided pursuant to Paragraph 10(iii) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, which requires a written description of a compensatory plan when no formal document contains the compensation information.
On January 7, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Altera adopted the Altera Bonus Plan for the 2008 fiscal year. The purpose of the Bonus Plan is to promote the interests of Altera and its stockholders by providing key employees with financial rewards upon achievement of specified business objectives, as well as help Altera attract and retain key employees by providing attractive compensation opportunities linked to performance results.
Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the three other most-highly-compensated officers, all other officers, as well as other key employees, are eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan.
Bonuses payable to our CEO and other officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, the "Executive Officers") under the Bonus Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee.
The target and maximum payouts, both of which are a percentage of base salary, that may be earned by each of our Executive Officers are as follows:
 
Under the Bonus Plan, actual payouts to the Executive Officers will be determined by the Compensation Committee based on a formula that takes into account (1) operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2008 (the "Financial Performance Metric") and (2) individual performance (the "Individual Performance Metric"). The Financial Performance Metric will determine the Potential Payout percentage (as specified in the table below) that may be earned by an Executive Officer, and the Individual Performance Metric will then be applied as a multiplier to determine the actual payout. The formula which the Compensation Committee will use to calculate the actual payouts to the Executive Officers (which are subject to the Maximum Payout Percentages specified above) is as follows:
Base Salary * (Target % * Potential Payout % * Individual Performance Metric %) = Actual Payout.
The Financial Performance Metric under the Bonus Plan will be operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2008. Operating income is defined as earnings before income, interest expense, and taxes. The Compensation Committee shall have discretion to exclude from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metric significant, non-recurring items. The Potential Payout Percentage will be calculated based on the following table:
 
If the results of the Financial Performance Metric do not appear on the above table, the Potential Payout Percentage shall be calculated on a proportional basis. For example, if 2008 operating income as a percentage of revenue is 25.5%, the Potential Payout Percentage will be 80%.
The Individual Performance Metric will be determined by the Compensation Committee as follows:
 
 
The Individual Performance Metric may range from 0-125%. In evaluating the performance of the Executive Officers other than the CEO, the Compensation Committee will take into account the CEO's evaluation of whether an individual has met his or her performance goals and the CEO's subjective assessment of overall performance. In evaluating the performance of the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEO's self-assessment as well as the assessment of the independent members of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee's determination as to whether individual performance goals have been met may be subjective in nature.
Payment of bonuses (if any) will be made in February or early March of 2009. Bonuses normally will be paid in cash in a single lump sum, subject to payroll taxes and tax withholdings.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

This newest generation of FPGAs, with industry-leading low-power and superior performance, extends the innovation advantages which are the basis of our strong competitive position," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "In addition to these and other new device introductions, our newest software and intellectual property offerings round out a substantial year of Altera innovation. We also took major steps to lower operating expense in 2007, and we will do so again in 2008. In 2007 we initiated our first quarterly dividend and a significant increase in our share repurchase plan to return additional value to shareholders."
 
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
., July 15, 2008Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced second quarter sales of $359.9 million, up 7 percent from the first quarter of 2008 and up 13 percent from the second quarter of 2007. Second quarter net income was $98.0 million, $0.32 per diluted share, up from net income of $83.9 million, $0.27 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008.

San Jose, Calif
First half cash flow from operating activities was $226.8 million. Altera repurchased 65,000 shares of its common stock during the second quarter at a cost of $1.4 million. To date during the third quarter, Altera has repurchased an additional 526,000 shares at a cost of $10.4 million. Altera ended the second quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share payable on September 2, 2008 to shareholders of record on August 11, 2008.
"The second quarter exceeded our expectations for growth and profitability. Our 90-nm FPGAs were the largest growth drivers and 65-nm FPGA sales more than doubled sequentially, leading to FPGA growth of 18 percent year over year. The combination of solid top line growth, continued gross margin improvement, and lower than planned operating expense created significant operating leverage and a very strong operating margin," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "We are on schedule to ship the industry's first 40-nm Stratix IV FPGAs later this year, the result of work we began several years ago to accelerate the availability of 40-nm programmable logic devices. The architectural and process leadership that these products represent will further strengthen our competitive position and growth prospects over the next several years."
 
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress.
 
For the first time, Altera offers a transceiver-based ASIC option with the new HardCopy IV ASIC family. Stratix FPGAs deliver the benefits of FPGA-based hardware and software co-design and co-verificationsaving months in time to marketand the use of HardCopy ASICs delivers the benefits of ASICs in production. Quartus II development software fully supports these devices. First sample silicon for the Stratix IV GX family is expected in the fourth quarter.

Only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the annual meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.
Section 2.1. Annual Meetings.

Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than 10 days (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 2.3. Notice of Meetings.
 
Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation.

Voting for the election of directors at any meeting of stockholders shall be as specified in Section 3.3 of these Bylaws. All other matters presented to the stockholders for a vote, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.
Section 2.7. Voting; Proxies.

If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

At an annual meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.

If the stockholder is not seeking inclusion of the proposal in the Corporations proxy statement or information statement, timely notice consists of a stockholders notice delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting.  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.  Other than with respect to stockholder proposals relating to director nomination(s) which requirements are set forth in Section 2.11 below, a stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business the stockholder desires to bring before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business; (v) as to the stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including, but not limited to, any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss or increase profit to or manage the risk or benefit of stock price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any such Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation (each, a Relevant Hedge Transaction), and (vi) as to the stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person, to the extent not set forth pursuant to the immediately preceding clause, (a) whether and the extent to which such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise, or any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation (a Derivative Instrument), (b) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (c) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (d) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholders immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date).

The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10, and if the Chairman should so determine he or she shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
Nothing in this Section 2.10 shall affect the right of a stockholder to request inclusion of a proposal in the Corporations proxy statement to the extent that such right is provided by an applicable law.
 
  In addition to any other applicable requirements, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11.  Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation, which shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations whether or not the stockholder is seeking to have a nomination included in the Corporations proxy statement or information statement under an applicable rule of the SEC, including, but not limited to, Regulation 14A or Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act.  To be timely, in the case of a stockholder seeking to have a nomination included in the Corporations proxy statement or information statement, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than 120 days or more than 180 days prior to the first Anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the previous years annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, then notice by the shareholder to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporations principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90 day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 15 day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. The stockholders notice relating to director nomination(s) shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the person, and (iv) any other information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of the stockholder, and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder; (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined in Section 2.9), to the extent not set forth pursuant to the immediately preceding clause, whether and the extent to which any Relevant Hedge Transaction (as defined in Section 2.9) has been entered into, and (d) as to the stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person, (1) whether and the extent to which any Derivative Instrument (as defined in Section 2.9) is directly or indirectly beneficially owned, (2) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (3) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (4) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholders immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date).  The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.  No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 3.1. General Powers.
 
The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, the number to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.
Section 3.2. Number; Qualifications.
 
At the first annual meeting of stockholders and at each annual meeting thereafter, the stockholders shall elect directors by a majority of the votes cast unless the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, in which case the directors shall be elected by a
Section 3.3. Election; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies.
 
 
 
 
plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares entitled to vote on the election of directors and represented in person or by proxy at such meeting casting their vote for a director must exceed the number of such votes cast against that director. If a nominee for director, who is not serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall not be elected. If a nominee for director, who is serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall then make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Governance Committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the reasons for it within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or resignation will not participate in the Boards decision.
 
Each director shall hold office for a term of one year or until such time as his successor is elected and qualified. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at the election of directors. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. Any newly created directorship resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, failure to receive a majority of the votes cast at an election of directors, removal from office or any other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining members of the Board of Directors, though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced or until his successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the whole Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
 
Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such times as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine, and if so determined notices thereof need not be given.
Section 3.4. Regular Meetings.
 
Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Lead Independent Director, or any two members of the Board of Directors.

The notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of the special meeting or the place of the special meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal office of the Corporation.
 
Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Section 3.6. Telephonic Meetings Permitted.
 
At all meetings of the Board of Directors fifty percent (50%) of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except in cases in which the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws otherwise provide, the vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours.

Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.
Section 3.9. Informal Action by Directors.
 
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, such loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the Corporation.

of another Corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such person.

Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account, and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs, or any other information storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a reasonable time.
Section 8.5. Form of Records.
 
These By-laws may be altered or repealed, and new By-laws made, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders may make additional by-laws and may alter and repeal any by-laws whether adopted by them or otherwise.

On October 14, 2008, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: October 14, 2008
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
., October 14, 2008Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced third quarter sales of $356.8 million, down 1 percent from the second quarter of 2008 and up 13 percent from the third quarter of 2007. Third quarter net income was $94.7 million, $0.31 per diluted share, down from net income of $98.0 million, $0.32 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008. Third quarter net income was up 37 percent and earnings per diluted share were up 58 percent compared with the third quarter of 2007.
San Jose, Calif
Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $341.4 million. Altera repurchased 2.1 million shares of its common stock during the third quarter at a cost of $42.3 million. Altera ended the third quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share payable on December 1, 2008 to shareholders of record on November 10, 2008.
"Our sales came in toward the higher end of our expectations for this seasonally slow quarter. Our 65-nm FPGAs had another extremely strong growth quarter with sales once again more than doubling sequentially," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "We remain on track to ship during this quarter our next generation Stratix IV FPGAs, the programmable industry's first 40-nm devices."
 
Additional Stratix IV FPGA Highlights
Altera has successfully taped-out the first member of its 40-nm Stratix IV family. This new family was engineered with the same highly reliable, test chip-centered development process used for prior FPGA families. Altera's Stratix IV family is the industry's first 40-nm FPGA and, when shipped later this quarter, will be one of the few 40-nm devices offered across the entire semiconductor industry. This new family extends the industry-leading density, performance, low-power, and software efficiency of prior-generation Stratix III FPGAs and, in addition, adds the industry's best available transceiver speed and bandwidth.
Altera has gained share in the FPGA market in recent years with products noted for their architectural innovation. With the Stratix IV family, Altera can offer customers even more attractive benefits based on a combination of both architectural and process-node leadership. The Stratix IV early adopter program has attracted more than twice the number of customers as any previous program. Nearly 600 customers are now part of this Stratix IV program and able to use Altera's Quartus design software to design Stratix IV FPGAs into applications across all of Altera's market segments.
As development costs for competing ASICs climb and engineers are forced to use older process technology, the economics and performance of leading-edge programmable logic become significantly more attractive. By moving quickly to the 40-nm node, Altera has placed the company in a strong position to compete for designs that previously were the exclusive domain of an ASIC-based solution.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
., December 8, 2008Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced its mid-quarter update for the fourth quarter of 2008.
San Jose, Calif
Fourth quarter sales are now expected to be down 9 to 12 percent compared to the third quarter of 2008. Prior guidance for fourth quarter sales was a range of up 1 percent to down 3 percent compared to third quarter of 2008. The company is experiencing slower than anticipated sales across all market segments, with particular weakness in the Computer & Storage and Consumer market segments. Inventory reductions by a broad range of end customers are occurring across all market segments.
Fourth quarter gross margin is now expected to be 69 percent +/- ..5%, an increase from prior guidance of 68 percent +/- .5%. The expected gross margin increase is due to the company's ongoing cost savings initiatives and expected market segment mix. As a result of additional ongoing cost savings initiatives, the company now expects that fourth quarter operating expense will be in the range of $134 to $135 million versus prior guidance of $137 to $140 million.
As previously scheduled, the company plans to make initial shipments of 40-nm Stratix IV devices to customers during this quarter.
The company will announce fourth quarter results after market close on January 27, 2009.

Net income rose 24 percent to $359.7 million, $1.18 per diluted share, versus net income of $290.0 million, $0.82 per diluted share, in 2007.
San Jose, Calif
Fourth quarter sales were $314.5 million, down 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 and down 12 percent from the third quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter net income was $83.0 million, $0.28 per diluted share, up from net income of $65.5 million, $0.20 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Altera repurchased 26.6 million shares of its common stock during 2008 at a cost of $473.2 million, with 9.0 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $154.2 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on March 2, 2009 to shareholders of record on February 10, 2009.
"While we experienced the effects of a global economic-driven slowdown in the fourth quarter, we increased our market share in the programmable logic industry for the sixth year in a row. Net income growth substantially outpaced sales growth as a result of our sustained focus on improving efficiencies across the company. We will apply these simplification and cost reduction skills in this current challenging business environment to help protect shareholder value," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board." As previously committed, we shipped our first 40-nm Stratix IV FPGAs in the fourth quarter, placing us in a leadership position that will strengthen our competitive position in 2009 and beyond."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
. March 2, 2009Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced its mid-quarter update for the first quarter of 2009.
SAN JOSE, Calif
First quarter sales are now expected to be down 15 to 20 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Prior guidance for first quarter sales was for sequential sales to decline in the range of 15 to 25 percent. The improved outlook is largely attributable to better than expected demand from OEMs providing equipment for Chinese 3G wireless networks. Overall, the first quarter sales outlook remains muted as a result of slowing global business conditions.
With initial Stratix IV FPGA shipments last quarter, Altera became the first programmable logic company to ship 40-nm devices. Altera remains on track to sell more than $1 million of 40-nm FPGAs in the first quarter including sales of the Stratix IV GX and the just introduced Stratix IV GT families.

(e) The following is a description of the Altera Corporation ("Altera") 2009 Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") provided pursuant to Paragraph 10(iii) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, which requires a written description of a compensatory plan when no formal document contains the compensation information.
On March 2, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Altera adopted the Altera Bonus Plan for the 2009 fiscal year. The purpose of the Bonus Plan is to promote the interests of Altera and its stockholders by providing key employees with financial rewards upon achievement of specified business objectives, as well as to help Altera attract and retain key employees by providing attractive compensation opportunities linked to performance results.
Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the three other most-highly-compensated officers, as well as all other executive officers are eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan. Bonuses payable to our CEO and other officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, the "Executive Officers") under the Bonus Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee.
The target and maximum payouts, both of which are a percentage of base salary, that may be earned by each of our Executive Officers are as follows:
 
The exact amount payable to an Executive Officer under the Bonus Plan will be determined at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. In exercising its discretion, the Compensation Committee will take into account Altera's operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2009 (the "Financial Performance Metric") as well as the individual Executive Officer's performance during the year. The Financial Performance Metric will determine a Potential Payout percentage (as specified in the table below) that may be earned by an Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee will then have the discretion to increase, decrease or eliminate the amount payable under the Bonus Plan based on the individual's performance during the year including his or her performance against goals that have been approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have the discretion to make a payout under the Bonus Plan even if the Potential Payout percentage is 0%; however, in no case may the actual payout under the Bonus Plan exceed the applicable Maximum Payout percentage listed above.
The Financial Performance Metric under the Bonus Plan will be operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2009. Operating income is defined as earnings before income, interest expense, and taxes. The Compensation Committee shall have discretion to exclude from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metric significant, non-recurring items. The Potential Payout Percentage will be calculated based on the following table:
 
If the results of the Financial Performance Metric do not appear on the above table, the Potential Payout Percentage shall be calculated on a proportional basis. For example, if 2009 operating income as a percentage of revenue is 25.5%, the Potential Payout Percentage will be 82.5%.
In evaluating the performance of the Executive Officers other than the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEO's evaluation of whether an individual has met his or her performance goals and the CEO's subjective assessment of overall performance. In evaluating the performance of the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEO's self-assessment as well as the assessment of the independent members of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee's determination as to whether individual performance goals have been met may be subjective in nature.
Payment of bonuses (if any) will be made in February or early March of 2010. Bonuses normally will be paid in cash in a single lump sum, subject to payroll taxes and tax withholdings.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

San Jose, Calif
First quarter 2009 results include a previously announced $5.2 million pretax restructuring charge. The company's first quarter 2009 tax expense also includes $2.0 million related to a recently enacted change in California tax law. The combined after-tax impact of these two items was $0.02 per diluted share.
First quarter cash flow from operating activities was $44.0 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on June 1, 2009 to stockholders of record on May 11, 2009.
"The first quarter business environment was better than we originally anticipated yet overall remains quite challenging. With double digit sequential growth, sales to wireless equipment customers, including those targeting new 3G deployments in China, were a bright spot in the quarter," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Our 40-nm FPGA sales are growing quickly, creating the fastest new product ramp in our history. The product roll out has been on schedule, reinforcing our first mover process advantage as well as providing customers access to the industry's highest density FPGAs and most advanced transceiver functionality."

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On August 4, 2009 the management of Altera Corporation (the "Company") committed to a plan to restructure its operations by eliminating approximately 87 positions from the Company's approximately 2,700 person workforce. Nearly all of the position eliminations will occur in the third quarter of 2009. The Plan is the result of the Company's efforts to lower its overall cost structure.
The Company will incur restructuring-related charges of approximately $4-5 million in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of employee severance costs. The Company estimates that the annualized savings from this restructuring will be approximately $9 million.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: September 8, 2009
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
. September 8, 2009Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced that, based on quarter-to-date results and a broad improvement in market conditions, the company now expects third quarter sales to be in a range of flat to up 3 percent from the second quarter. Previous guidance had been for sales to decline 1 to 5 percent sequentially.
SAN JOSE, Calif
All market segments, except for the telecom and wireless segment, will be up sequentially in the third quarter. The decline in telecom and wireless is more moderate than previously anticipated as a result of better than forecast demand from OEMs supplying Asian wireless networks.
As previously announced, third quarter results will include approximately $4.5 million in severance costs, with nearly all of these costs being included in third quarter operating expense. These actions will create approximately $1.0 million in operating expense savings in the third quarter and, when fully implemented, approximately $9 million in annual run rate savings. Including the net effect of this restructuring, Altera now anticipates that third quarter operating expense will be in the range of $126 to $128 million compared with prior guidance of $122 to $126 million.
Design wins for Altera's newly launched 40-nm products continue to be very strong. As anticipated, third quarter sales of 40-nm products are likely to approximate $10 million, more than double second quarter levels.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(b) On February 16, 2010, Gregory E. Myers notified the Board of Directors of Altera Corporation (Altera) that he intends to retire and will not seek re-election to Alteras Board of Directors at the companys next annual meeting of stockholders on May 6, 2010. Mr. Myers has confirmed that he has no disagreement with the company.
(e) The following is a description of the Altera 2010 Executive Bonus Plan (the Bonus Plan) provided pursuant to Paragraph 10(iii) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, which requires a written description of a compensatory plan when no formal document contains the compensation information.
On February 16, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Altera adopted the Altera Bonus Plan for the 2010 fiscal year. The purpose of the Bonus Plan is to promote the interests of Altera and its stockholders by providing key employees with financial rewards upon achievement of specified business objectives, as well as help Altera attract and retain key employees by providing attractive compensation opportunities linked to performance results.
Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the three other most-highly-compensated officers, as well as all other executive officers are eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan. Bonuses payable to our CEO and other officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, the Executive Officers) under the Bonus Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee.
The target and maximum payouts, both of which are a percentage of base salary, that may be earned by each of our Executive Officers are as follows:
The exact amount payable to an Executive Officer under the Bonus Plan will be determined at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. In exercising its discretion, the Compensation Committee will take into account Alteras operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2010 (the Financial Performance Metric) as well as the individual Executive Officers performance during the year. The Financial Performance Metric will determine a Potential Payout percentage (as specified in the table below) that may be earned by an Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee will then have the discretion to increase, decrease or eliminate the amount payable under the Bonus Plan based on the individuals performance during the year, including his or her performance against goals that have been approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have the discretion to make a payout under the Bonus Plan even if the Potential Payout percentage is 0%; however, in no case may the actual payout under the Bonus Plan exceed the applicable Maximum Payout percentage listed above.
The Financial Performance Metric under the Bonus Plan will be operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2010. Operating income is defined as earnings before interest and other income, interest expense, and taxes (including the expense associated with the Bonus Plan Payout) divided by Net Sales. The Compensation Committee shall have discretion to exclude significant, non-recurring items, as well as amounts attributable to Alteras non-qualified deferred compensation plan, from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metric.
 
Significant non-recurring transactions are defined as items that could have a material effect on the outcome of the calculated bonus, are unusual in nature and occur infrequently. For purposes of the calculation, items are deemed to have a material effect if they have a positive or negative impact on operating margin income of greater than 1% of net sales or $10 million for the full year impact (net of any resulting dollar savings) of each type of unusual or infrequently occurring item (whether they occur in one or more transactions). Unusual in nature refers to those transactions or events that possess a high degree of abnormality and are of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of Altera and the industry. Examples of significant, non-recurring items that the Compensation Committee may elect to exclude from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metric include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) restructuring charges as defined by US GAAP; (2) business combinations as defined by US GAAP; (3) asset impairment or discontinuation of operations recognized under US GAAP; (4) earthquake, tsunami, flood, hurricane, typhoon, or fire resulting in an expense recognized under US GAAP; and (5) other significant non-recurring transactions as appropriate.
The Potential Payout Percentage will be calculated based on the following table:
If the results of the Financial Performance Metric do not appear on the above table, the Potential Payout Percentage shall be calculated on a proportional basis. For example, if 2010 operating income as a percentage of revenue is 27.5%, the Potential Payout Percentage will be 105%.
In evaluating the performance of the Executive Officers other than the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEOs evaluation of whether an individual has met his or her performance goals and the CEOs subjective assessment of overall performance. In evaluating the performance of the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEOs self-assessment as well as the assessment of the independent members of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committees determination as to whether individual performance goals have been met may be subjective in nature.
Payment of bonuses (if any) will be made in February or March of 2011. Bonuses normally will be paid in cash in a single lump sum, subject to payroll taxes and tax withholdings.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

9.    
STOCK ROTATION AND RETURNS
 
9.1
Return of Products
. If Altera determines in accordance with its Stock Rotation Policy that Distributor's inventory is overstocked with certain Products, Distributor may return such Products to Altera pursuant to subparagraph 9.2. Products that are obsolete or discontinued may only be returned pursuant to subparagraph 9.3 of this Agreement. Returns of Products that are permitted in connection with the termination of this Agreement are subject to paragraph 14. All returns require a Return Material Authorization (RMA) and must follow Altera return policies.
 
Distributor shall bear all freight costs and risk of loss or damage during shipment of returned Products and shall ship returned Products in accordance with Altera's reasonable instructions.
 
Distributor's account will be credited by Altera in the amount paid by Distributor for the returned Products after Altera receives the Products and verifies their quantity and quality. All returned Products must be unused, undamaged, and in Altera factory-sealed bags or Altera factory-shipped boxes. Distributor may not take any deductions from payments due to Altera before Altera has issued a credit to Distributor; Altera will charge interest at the rate of one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month or at the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less, from the date that Distributor makes any unauthorized deductions.
9.2
Procedure for Stock Rotations
. Each Altera fiscal semi-annual (i.e. six-month) period, Altera will accept one (1) Stock Rotation return from Distributor for the purpose of clearing Distributor's inventory of Product that in Distributor's reasonable judgment is unlikely to be sold. If Distributor does not initiate a Stock Rotation return before the end of the applicable Altera fiscal semi-annual period, that period's allowance will be forfeited. Under this provision, Distributor may return to Altera Product valued at up to five percent (5%) of Altera's net billings to Distributor for the Altera fiscal semi-annual period prior to the Stock Rotation. A portion of such approved stock rotation total dollar level, not to exceed five percent (5%) thereof, may be eligible to be scrapped under the Altera scrap policies. As a precondition for accepting a Stock Rotation, Altera may require that Distributor take delivery from Altera of Product of value equal to or less than the value of the Product returned.
9.3
Obsolete and Discontinued Products
. Altera may render obsolete or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of any Product (Discontinued Product) and shall notify Distributor of any Discontinued Product. Distributor shall have the right to return Discontinued Product to Altera to the extent purchased from Altera within the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of Product discontinuation notice. Within thirty (30) days of the last order date, Distributor shall notify Altera of Distributor's intention to return any Discontinued Product in its inventory which was purchased by Distributor from Altera. Such notification shall include the Last Time Ship date for such Discontinued Product. Distributor's account will be credited by Altera in the amount paid by Distributor for the returned Products after Altera receives the Products and
 
 
verifies their quantity and quality. Debit claims for Discontinued Product will be honored for six (6) months after the Last Time Ship date.
9.4
Administrative Procedures for Returns
. Product returns to Altera pursuant to subparagraphs 9.2, 9.3, and 14.5(c) as well as any other Product returns to Altera are subject to the following provisions:
(a) Distributor must request and receive from Altera a Return Material Authorization number for each return prior to shipping Product to Altera. Altera will not unreasonably withhold Return Material Authorizations.
(b) Altera retains the right to review all line items prior to return and approve or deny any item requested for return by Distributor. Altera will establish and publish reasonable requirements for the approval of return line items, and for the handling and packaging of Product to be returned, in order to protect the quality of Altera Products and minimize the administrative expenses associated with returns.
(c) Return Material Authorization numbers are valid for sixty (60) days from the date of issuance to Distributor. If Distributor fails to return the Products within that sixty (60) day period, Altera shall not be obligated to accept the Products or to credit Distributor's account for the Products.
 
9.5
Defective Products

Altera reserves the right to review and reject Distributor's use of Trademarks.

. As both a covenant by Distributor and a condition of Altera's sale or license of the Products to Distributor, Distributor will include on each copy of the Products that it distributes, and on all containers and storage media, all copyright, patent, trademark, and other notices of proprietary rights included by Altera on the Products.

11.3
No Distributor Rights in Altera Intellectual Property Rights
. Distributor has paid no consideration for the use of Altera's copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Distributor any interest in any of them. Distributor acknowledges that Altera owns or holds a license to all copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets related to the Products and agrees that it will not knowingly at any time during or after this Agreement assert or claim any interest in or do anything that may adversely affect the validity or enforceability of any copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets owned by or licensed to Altera (including, without limitation, any act, or assistance to act, which may infringe or lead to the infringement of any copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets related to the Products). Nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent Distributor from challenging the validity of any trademark, copyright, or patent.

11.7
Patent Indemnity
.
 
(a) Altera shall defend any suit, proceeding, or claim of infringement asserted against Distributor insofar as such suit, proceeding, or claim of infringement alleges that any Product manufactured and supplied by Altera to Distributor infringes any duly issued patent, and Altera shall pay all damages and costs finally awarded therein against Distributor, provided that Altera promptly is informed and furnished a copy of each communication, notice or other action relating to the alleged infringement and is given authority, information, and assistance (at Altera's expense) necessary to defend or settle said suit or proceeding. Altera shall have the absolute right to control the defense and settlement of any infringement suit or proceeding for which Distributor seeks indemnification under this subparagraph. Altera shall not be obligated to defend or be liable for costs and damages if the infringement arises out of (1) Products that are manufactured by Altera in accordance with Distributor's specifications, or (2) the Products being combined with or added to another product, or (3) the Products being modified after delivery to Distributor by Altera, or (4) from use of the Products, or any part thereof, in the practice of a process. Altera's obligations hereunder shall not apply to any infringement occurring after Distributor has received notice of such suit or proceeding alleging the infringement unless Altera has given written permission for such use by Distributor.
 
(b) If any Products manufactured and supplied by Altera to Distributor shall be held to infringe any United States patent and Distributor shall be enjoined from using the same, Altera will at its option and at its expense (1) procure for Distributor the right to use such Products free of any liability for patent infringement, or (2) replace such Products with non-infringing substitute Products, or (3) refund the purchase price of such Products.
 
(c) If the infringement by Distributor is alleged prior to Altera's completion of delivery of the Products, Altera may decline to make further shipments without being in breach of this Agreement.
 
(d) If any suit, proceeding, or claim of infringement is asserted against Altera based on a claim that the goods manufactured by Altera in compliance with Distributor's specifications and supplied to Distributor directly infringe any duly issued United States patent, then Distributor shall indemnify Altera to the same extent as specified in subparagraph 11.7(a) of this Agreement. However, Distributor shall not be obligated to indemnify Altera for specifications developed solely by Distributor's end customer.

$103.0 million
,
$0.34
per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Cash flow from operating activities in 2010 was

"The fourth quarter delivered a positive note to end a remarkable sales growth year. Our sales were up 64 percent in 2010, significantly outpacing most companies in the semiconductor industry. In the fourth quarter, new products continued to be growth drivers as we saw substantial sales gains from our 65-nm and 40-nm FPGAs," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "During the fourth quarter we taped out our first 28-nm FPGAs. We believe Altera's unique features and performance will extend our technology leadership into this next FPGA generation adding to the momentum we have established at the 40-nm node."

Thank you, Scott. Revenue for the fourth quarter 2010 was a record $555 million, representing a sequential increase of 5%, and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Our large customers were the growth leaders in Q4 with a collective growth rate well above the overall average.
 
On the product side we achieved a 26% sequential growth for new products, while our mainstream and mature product categories were down versus Q3. This sequential decrease in mainstream and mature products appears to be customer inventory fine-tuning and is not a surprise.
 
Sequential growth within new products included Stratix IV increasing 25%, Cyclone III up 23%, Arria II up 22%, MAX II down 4%, Stratix III up 34%, Cyclone IV up strongly at $2 million, and HardCopy III and IV up 378% at $10 million.
 
Stepping back for 2010 we experienced a nearly 200% increase in new products, with most of this dollar increase coming from 65 nanometer. Mainstream products produced growth of 12% and mature products decreased 7%, as one would expect.
 
In Q4 40 nanometer revenue increased sequentially 35%, and 65 nanometer revenue showed sequential growth of 28%. For Q4 40 and 65 nanometer revenue represented 17% and 31%, respectively, of total revenue. 40 nanometer revenue on a cumulative basis is over $260 million to date.
 
Q4 turns were in the mid-20s range, consistent with our guidance. Book to bill for the quarter was below 1, which is to be expected as our leadtimes returned to normal levels for essentially all products. In Q4 we did not see an unusual number of cancellations.
 
Gross margin at 71% was up 90 basis points from Q3, and at the high-end of guidance. Improved yields and material cost

improvements were the big drivers, offset by slightly unfavorable vertical mix.
 
Operating expenses of $131 million were slightly higher than guidance. Some of this increase can be attributed to our recent acquisition of Avalon and an array of individual items that came in slightly over forecast.
 
Operating margin for Q4 was 47.4%, the highest level in 2010. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 12% after netting the favorable effects of the R&D tax credit with some offsetting fourth-quarter discrete items.
 
Net income for the quarter was $232 million or $0.72 per diluted share. On the balance sheet cash and investment balances increased to $2.8 billion, helped as in the last several quarters by cash received from option exercises.
 
Cash flow from operating activities was $210 million for the quarter, and our cash conversion cycle was 85 days. We ended Q4 with total pipeline month supply in hand of 3.5, consistent with our guidance. Ending Q4 inventory is comprised of 2.7 months for Altera and 0.8 months for distributors.
 
Moving on to our outlook for the first quarter of 2011, we expect revenue to be down 1% to 5%. First-quarter turns looked to be in the mid to high 30s. This sequential increase in our turns is to be expected as our lead times have shortened. Keep in mind that historically a normal turns number runs in the 50% to 60% range, and over time will likely return to that range.
 
Gross margin for Q1 will be 71% to 72%, as we anticipate some favorable vertical mix.
 
We are targeting R&D spend at $76 million to $77 million, up from Q4, as we begin a multi-quarter period 28 nanometer introductions and the strategic initiatives we described in our November 29 call.
 
SG&A should be $69 million to $70 million. For both R&D and SG&A the full-year operating expense estimates we gave you on November 29 are still valid. We expect ending Q1 month supply in hand inventory to be in the mid-3s, which is still in the desirable range of 3 to 4 month supply on hand.
 
The tax rate for Q1 will be 10% to 12%, which is slightly favorable to our earlier guidance due to US R&D tax credit.
 
Diluted share count for Q1 will be approximately 327 million shares. Additionally, for full-year diluted share count you should use a revised number of 329 million shares. Since our call on November 29 we have seen an increase in option exercises and stock price, which increases our diluted share forecast for FY '11.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to John.

Thank you, Ron. We are pleased to Q4 revenues increased 5% sequentially to cap a stellar year of revenue growth, profitability and marketshare gain.
 
For the fourth-quarter telecom wireless revenue increased 10% sequentially on wireless growth in GSM, WCDMA and microwave applications. Telecom decreased due to inventory rebalancing across several customers. Huawei represented 16% of revenue in the quarter.
 
Industrial, military, automotive declined 9%, with a significant decrease in military on program timing. Computers, storage, networking increased 17%, with double-digit growth in each subsegment. Other grew 2%.
 
In 2010 our revenues increased 64%, outpacing the semiconductor, ASIC, ASSP and PLD markets by a wide margin. Improved end-market conditions and increased PLD content in new generation systems were both contributors to the PLD industry growth. Our market success with 65 nanometer and 40 nanometer FPGAs then led to Altera's significant outgrowth of the PLD industry.
 
Additionally, our 2000 growth was broad-based -- 2010 growth was broad-based. Telecom wireless increased 64%, industrial military and automotive 60%, computer storage networking, 55%, and other increased 73%.
 
On the product line front in 2010 we focused on 28 nanometer development. As announced, we will introduce more products in 28 nanometer than any previous process node, again relying on the customer input to drive our specifications.
 
FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
 
We also continue the tailored device strategy that has delivered our significant marketshare growth over the last several process nodes. Stratix V and HardCopy V are on the HP process for high-performance, as they have been in prior generations. Arria V and Cyclone V are on the LP process with low-power and low product costs. Each product will have optimized architecture, memory, DSP and transceivers tailored for diverse market requirements.
 
This portfolio approach, while perhaps costlier in R&D, matches customer need across a broad array of markets, delivering superior growth and profitability.
 
We taped out our first Stratix V 28 nanometer family member in December and plan to sample in Q1.
 
For Q1 revenue we are forecasting a 1% to 5% sequential decrease. We expect telecom wireless to decline as a few customers rebalance inventory, and because TDS CDMA fourth-round deployment completed in Q4. This should be partially offset by growth in WCDMA and LTE. Industrial military and automotive should increase on military and automotive. Computer, storage, networking should be flat to slightly down. Other should decrease.
 
Our book to bill was under 1 in Q4, as expected with a leadtime reduction. The turns required to make the Q1 guidance are in the mid-to high 30% range, well below our historical high 50s range. There are very few customers that have reported inventory, and the amount looks minimal, which correlates to the low turns number.
 
In summary, our 2010 results show the success of PLDs and Altera specifically in replacing ASICs due to the rising semiconductor design costs associated with each new process node. And note the addressable ASIC market is still twice the size of the PLD industry.
 
The design cost burden also affects microprocessors and ASSPs. Using our FPGAs as a product platform, we are adding microprocessors to encroach on the embedded industry and IP blocks, as evidenced by our Avalon acquisition, to replace ASSPs. Our goal is to continue to grow at a rate of double the semiconductor industry on average. And with an estimated $47 billion ASIC, ASSP and embedded market replacement opportunity, we believe we are well positioned to do so.
 
Now let me turn this call back to Scott.

Thank you very much. Just let me start with Ron. Ron, can we just put a little bit what is going on with the inventory? I know you said it still within your normal range, but we kind of had a huge jump this quarter. Can you try and pass that data and tell us what is happening with any specific customers, or within distribution, just for us to get slightly better comfort with that? Looking forward how should we think about a trend for inventory now that leadtimes are back to normal?

So a good question. So you look at the last year, historically we were running inventory a year ago December below 3, and then through the year in the low 3s. And also our leadtimes were actually extended.
 
So to some extent this is just getting leadtimes synced with inventory. It is still in a very desirable range. As I said earlier in the script, we are basically at standard leadtimes for almost all products.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
There is a breakout of distribution versus Altera inventory that is in the press release, so see you can see that. Again, typically we have tried to operate between 3 to 4 months supply on hand total of both distribution in Altera. At 3.5 I think we are in great shape, particularly coming out of a period where we did not have enough inventory and ultimately caused the leadtime expansion.

Let me switch guys a little bit. John, you talked about your gross margin when you gave your business update, I think, a couple of months ago. And even as you're seeing strength in FPGAs over ASICs, the data at least suggests that gross margins continued to stay strong.
 
Why should -- how should we think about this going forward as to what gross margins should trend? What factors should affect that as we look at you versus the ASIC players?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ron Pasek
- Altera Corporation - CFO
 
This is Ron. I think a couple of things. The biggest factor that will swing gross margin in the short term is of course vertical mix. And that is why you are seeing a slight increase from Q4 to Q1.
 
But what we talked about on November 29 over the long term for this year you should see margins around 70% plus or minus 1 point. And over the long term what we said over the next -- certainly at the end of five years, probably going down to 65%.

I am just curious, your competitor has been talking a lot about share gains stabilizing by the end of this year. I am just curious as to -- in terms of the design cycle what you have seen, how you can draw that back maybe 12 months, given how that share shift should have happened in terms of designs translating to revenue later this year? And then in terms of just high-end versus low-end how do you think you are positioned going forward? Thanks.

So I would expect that Altera will once again increase marketshare again in 2011, as we did in 2010, and actually going back, I

think, probably for the last eight years. I have seen nothing in the battle of 40 and 45 nanometer which I believe will change the momentum that we have.
 
I do think because Altera did so well in 40 nanometer with roughly two/thirds of the overall revenue that we should continue to gain marketshare as the 40 nanometer node continues to grow over the next several years.
 
In the 28 nanometer battle I think actually we are extremely well set up to continue that momentum. I like our tailored product approach. It is something that has done us very well for several generations of products now. I think it addresses a wider array of markets and applications. I think it also provides a much better cost structure for each individual product. So I would expect as we enter into the 28 nanometer battle that Altera will continue to do extremely well.
 
So fundamentally in conclusion, I just don't see anything that has happened near term or from what I've heard from announcements of competitors that I think changes the momentum that we have in the marketplace today.

Going back to the first question about inventory, now we've got leadtimes back to normal. Inventories are back to normal. How would you characterize the supply environment that you are in right now, John? Do you think this is something where for the balance of the year your concern is more that things are tight or your concern is more that things may get a little loose?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
Right now we are in a position where we can get the product that we need. I think if we were to grow 64% again this year we would probably struggle getting product. But based on our plan we feel that we have enough supply commitment from our foundry substrate suppliers and back end assembly suppliers, and ultimately test capacity, that we will be okay.
 
So right now we are projecting based on our numbers that we will be okay. There may be some tightness in a few specific nodes. We will have to deal with that as things come.
 
I guess the question then becomes are we doing anything to procure inventory strategically ahead of time. No, that is not our plan. Ultimately we would rather purchase the product at a later date when yields improve and costs go down than trying to put inventory in place. Because, once again, we do think we have adequate capacity commitments from our supply base.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Glen Yeung
- Citi - Analyst
 
Right, okay. As a follow-up, just thinking about the 28 nanometer node again, and the idea that we have now seen share gain from Altera really several years, if you go way back. As we think about 28 and yourself and Xilinx are coming in in a similar time

Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
frame, plus or minus, but with different sort of family approaches, for lack of a better term.
 
Is this a node where you think you can extend your share gain? You are kind of almost at record levels now -- marketshare. Can you go even further still at the 28 nanometer node?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
I would expect that we can. The reason is because I think the approaches between the two companies are actually quite different in this process node. We are continuing the tailored approach by product.
 
Remember, when we originally came out with the Cyclone family and designed a dedicated die for that that was low cost, it really did significantly extend our overall business. We did that by cutting down features, cutting down performance, but not having to sacrifice anything in our Stratix family.
 
I think the advantage that our competitor does have is, if you do one product and one process technology, which is, I think, essentially what they're doing, you can lower your overall R&D investment. But I think it is important to remember that the battle that we fight is not with necessarily our primary [POE] competitors, the battle is for ASICs and ASSPs.
 
And we supply into a diverse set of markets that each have different requirements of technology. Consumer, for instance, television sets does not require high-performance. It does not require high-end transceivers. It does not require high density. It is more about product costs.
 
When you are in OTN applications it is quite the opposite. Density, performance, transceiver speed are everything to those customers. So we believe that by having a tailored product set we could address more applications. We can displace more ASICs and ASSPs, which obviously leads to revenue growth.
 
And, again, because each product is differentiated, the lower-end products like Arria and Cyclone, will have a much lower cost structure per die. And we think that will be advantageous for us from a gross margin perspective long-term as well.
 
So I am actually -- from everything I have seen and heard over the many months from our competition, I'm actually excited about 28. I think it plays in our favor. There is nothing that has been announced that has us rethinking our strategy. And we do think we can extend the gains that we have had in 40, and hopefully accelerate that in 28.

Thank you for taking my questions. A quick big picture question for you, John. Given that you outgrew the broader semiconductor industry by 2 times or maybe more than 2 times in 2010, when 90 and 60 nanometer designs were really the volume drivers. I guess as we move into 2011 and 2012 when 40 and 28 nanometer are the volume drivers, do you think that perhaps your long-term growth target could prove somewhat conservative?

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
Well, we still -- our target is to grow twice as fast as the semiconductor industry on average. We do believe that this year in 2011 that we will outgrow the semiconductor industry. We would hope so to continue to do that.
 
It is really a factor of a couple of things. One, I think we have done really well in 40. Obviously, 40 is really the growth note for programmable logic over the next several years, so we should get a marketshare advantage for that.
 
Then if you look at our products like Stratix IV, we really did open up a lot of new applications, had record design wins, had record opportunities. And I think that speaks to the fact that programmable logic really opened up a lot more of the ASIC and ASSP market to replace. And that means that revenue is in the future, and we should be able to grow at a faster rate than those industries.
 
28 then continues that acceleration obviously. By the time you are in 28 you are now a good four nodes -- process nodes ahead of the mainstream ASIC industry. And you really are compelling for almost all ASIC designs for them to use your programmable logic instead. And I think we can continue to see PLDs accelerate the replacement.
 
Again, remember, what we believe that we can replace -- so if we take out things like handsets, we take out games, we take out platforms that we know that we cannot participate in, either because of cost or power, and we look mainly at the infrastructure, there is about a $47 billion opportunity of products that we can go replace. Simply replacing 1% of that per year gives you an opportunity to grow the Company at a 10% compound annual.
 
So we feel pretty good that we have the opportunity. We just need to continue to execute on our end and take marketshare.

Speaking of taking marketshare, I guess moving to 40 nanometer last quarter your competitor said that they had pegged their share at roughly 40%. I don't believe that we got a number this quarter. I was just wondering if you have your thoughts on where your marketshare stands at the 40 nanometer node?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
It is probably between 60% to 70%, and probably about 65% from what we saw for the entire year. I didn't see a breakout by quarter from our competitors, so we didn't know. But if you take the whole year, which is where they gave the figure, it is about 63% to 65% in favor of Altera.

John, you said that TD-SCDMA market is going to decline or is in a decline because of inventory correction. I am just wondering what is next after phase 4? Are you hearing anything about if there is a potential phase 5? And also if you can touch upon where the WCDMA growth is coming from, whether it is US or India? And then how important the telecom and wireless market is for you to outgrow the industry this year? Thank you.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
 
So TD-SCDMA is the technology that China Mobile is deploying for their third generation. Remember that there are three communication operators in China. China Mobile's deployment comes in phases. The others are doing more regular measured purchases.
 
So while TD-SCDMA has ended, that does not mean -- for the fourth round that doesn't mean that China Wireless has ended because the other two carriers continue to deploy.
 
Additionally, remember that the wireline infrastructure in China is still in its infancy, and there will continue to be a very significant telecom deployment in China.
 
So TD-SCDMA goes in phases of rounds. We just completed the fourth round. There is now discussion of the fifth. It is possible that the fifth may turn away from TD-SCDMA into LTE or TD-LTE, which is the Chinese version. If that happens, great. If it stays TD-SCDMA that is fine too, because we have very high marketshare in either of those.
 
It is not -- TD-SCDMA did not end because of inventory, it really ends because, again, they do the purchases in a block or short period of time and then in between there is a redesign cycle.
 
In terms of WCDMA we are seeing deployment really across quite a few geographies. With the deployment of smartphones requiring an upgrade in data bandwidth capability, we are seeing deployment in the United States still, in Europe, and other developing countries, certainly in China. And we have seen some initial work for India.
 
GSM has also been quite strong for India, as well as other developing countries. As I mentioned, microwave as a backhaul has been very strong and played as well.

Then if I may just one quick question for Ron. Ron, your leadtimes are back to normal and inventories are back to normal. I'm just wondering why your turns are not back to normal yet? Thank you.

Ron Pasek
- Altera Corporation - CFO
 
Well, as we told you a couple quarters in a row, we had this phenomena of customers placing inventory not just for the current quarter but for the next quarter as well, and that is still happening. So we had a number of orders in our books for Q1 for a while. And that has the effect of lowering the turns number. I don't know how long it is going to last, but it is nice to have.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
I would expect the turns number over time to get back up into the high 50s. It is where we operated for many, many years, and I think customers have said repeatedly that they will go back to that.
 
But what you're seeing is a very orderly transition from a period of time where we had lengthened leadtimes to know, as Ron mentioned, cancellations have been minimal and quite consistent with what happened all of last year. We have seen some push-outs, but they have been easy to deal with. And, therefore, we are tremendous amount of backlog still, which is why the turns number is low.

Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could address the industrial OEM customer mix right now, meaning medical, test and measurement, automotive customers, things like that? What are you seeing from those customers now? Are they in an inventory takedown mode, or do you think they are running pretty much steady at this point?.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
The industrial business is fairly steady at this point. I think if you look at some of the areas that you mentioned, some were up in Q4, some maybe down in Q1. But we haven't really identified a lot of that being tied to inventory as much as it is program timing or customers and their success of their products in the marketplace.
 
So as we mentioned, the overall other category did fairly well in the fourth calendar quarter; it grew 2%. We are expecting it to decline this quarter, but I don't think it's a tremendous decline.
 
If you look at the industrial category, which includes military and automotive, it did decline in Q4, but we are expecting it to grow this quarter because of automotive, as well as military.
 
So I think generally most of the categories are fairly stable at this point at a gross level.

Fair enough. Then on a geographic basis, it was pretty notable that Japan was very, very strong and the US declined a lot. Is the US decline just due to military or is there any more color on what was going on within those geographical regions? Thank you.

Thank you. A question on the gross margin. When you had provided guidance for 70% ahead, did you assume that gross margins will be higher in the first half and lower in the second half? I was just modeling flat. Can you just give us some color on that one?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ron Pasek
- Altera Corporation - CFO
 
Yes, we didn't really give -- we are not that fine tuned. Again, it depends on vertical mix throughout the year, so we just gave a 70% plus or minus 1 point. So in any given quarter, as that mix of vertical revenue comes in, it will affect margin. So I can't tell you that we modeled the first half different than the second half at all.

And then on the military you said it was down significantly. Was there anything specific? Because usually for your competitor at least the military is -- December is like a peak quarter. Is that any reason that you have a different seasonality than your competitor?

John Daane

I don't know specifically what our competitor did this Q4, but certainly it was down for us. It was simply -- in Q4 it was program timing. It is going up this quarter. So nothing I think tremendously unusual there.

Can you share with us what your mix of wireless versus wireline within your telecom and wireless segment was for Q4 and the full year? And then I have a quick follow-up.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Why don't you say your quick follow-up and then maybe we can compute it while we are talking.

Shawn Webster

Okay, on the theme of ASIC displacement, I am just -- it was hoping that maybe you might have some quantitative information for us in terms of design wins or something more specific that we could wrap our arms around and try and quantify that aspect of your revenue growth?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
Well, I think if you look at a macro level this is the fourth year that programmable logic has outperformed the ASIC industry. And so this year significantly more perhaps than the last couple. But it certainly gives you an indication that it is not a one-year trend; it has been a multiyear trend.
 
Again, the cost is the issue, and I think that is at this point universally accepted. Because you see the growth across a broad array of marketplaces, it is not one application or one area that we are replacing ASIC as much as it is just broadly.
 
We have talked in the past, for instance, about security cameras using PLDs today. Military applications like radios used to be ASICs and DSPs are now using programmable logic.
 
 
FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
Communications equipment, obviously, you have seen a very significant increase in programmable logic content replacing a large number of ASICs and some ASSPs in a broad array of product lines.
 
So we have talked about PLDs entering into consumer applications like television sets, where ASICs used to be used in the past, or in some cases ASSPs. So I can't really give you one thing, because it is not as much as it is just a trend broadly in a large number of marketplaces, and PLDs are benefiting, and I think ultimately because Altera has been better positioned in products, we are benefiting more.
 
Then on the products breakdown, my guess would be it is 60% wireless, 40% telecom. How close am I?

Thanks, guys. Sticking with (inaudible) question on end-markets, John, you were kind enough to give us your end-market color commentary on Q1. Can you just maybe give us your relative growth expectations for end-markets for the year?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
For the year I really can't. The reason is it is very difficult for our customers themselves to forecast a full year, and provide what they believe their guidance is going to be. And so we just try to stick with one quarter at a time. Certainly we do expect to outgrow the semiconductor industry for the full year, but that is about all I could an say at this point.

Yes, thanks. First question on gross margins, could you describe the differences in the cost reductions and yield improvements you got this time versus back in March when you had another uptick? I am assuming it is 40 nano-related. Also, I thought the mix would richen a little bit going forward given less wireless deployments.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
So definitely more of the yield improvement was direct related to 40 this quarter versus March of last year. That is certainly a factor. I'm trying to understand the second part of your question.

Ian Ing

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
Wireless base stations tend to have leaner mix, and I would think it would richen if that is a little bit below average growth. I think you are guiding wireless and wireless down next quarter.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ron Pasek
- Altera Corporation - CFO
 
Yes, so again, as a vertical telecom tends to have slightly lower margins than some of the other verticals.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
I think the thing with telecom and wireless is it really depends on the application within it. If you are in a base station the volumes are lower than if you are in a radio. So where the volumes increase typically the pricing on the margins go down, which is why in general consumer has lower gross margins than, for instance, industrial or defense-related market segments.
 
Pricing tends to be volume-related in semiconductors. So sometimes where we could have a flat communications quarter, but the mix within communications can change and that can cause -- from a high-volume to a low-volume segment and that can cause margins to swing one way or the other.
 
So understand that there is a lot of puts and takes within these markets that drive that. Overall we did benefit from a lot of product cost reductions. Our yields continue to substantially improve generally or well ahead of what others are seeing in similar process nodes with a similar foundry. And we are very pleased with what our organization has been able to do with cost reductions over last year and hopefully through Q1.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ian Ing
- Gleacher and Company - Analyst
 
A quick follow-up for John. The high-speed (inaudible), you're pushing that fairly aggressively down the stack, 5 gig at Cyclone and 10 gig at Arria, could you talk about the impact of cannibalization, because you've got to convert some of the Stratix IV sockets?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
Really that is because what has happened is broadly there are a number of serial protocols that have entered into the industry. So you think of things like PCI Express or CPRI for wireless or SATA, which is a storage, there are a broad array of these which require different performance rates.
 
So even some of the cost sensitive markets like consumer have moved to serial I/O standards. The midrange, the CPRI rate has moved up into the 5 to 6.5 gig area, which is why you see Arria with that standard. So it is simply because the bandwidth is moving up in a lot of these end applications, and we need to deal with that for the cost application.
 
I do think that is an advantage for us, because, again, we are doing the tailored approach. So by having a lower performance transceiver in one family that means the I/O buffer itself is substantially smaller, the cost is lower. And I think that gives us an advantage in each of these markets by having the tailored approach.

Thanks for taking my question. John, what do you think the -- how would you characterize the biggest wireless opportunities geographically and by area interface standard this year? And with that,can you talk about how big you expect LTE to be for you?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
I think China will continue to be strong, because of telecom really for -- and microwave for backhaul. There will be more cards added to the base stations. In other words, a lot of the base stations were deployed with not being completely full. So as we see an uptick in user demand for smartphones, I think that will continue.
 
Obviously India is a great marketplace. There has been 2G deployment. There will be 3G deployment as the spectrum has been purchased. North America, because both the continued deployment of HSDPA, and combined with WCDMA plus LTE. And then you'll see the emerging countries continue to deploy to GSM which should be strong. And that is going to be South America and that is going to be Africa.
 
Then you're going to see some initial deployments of LTE in Japan. So I think you're actually going to see a broader deployment of equipment in wireless from a geography standpoint than we saw last year.
 
Now a lot of people look at the CapEx figures and they say -- well, CapEx is down, therefore it is going to impact the programmable logic suppliers. And if you go back and look at it, CapEx for telecom has actually been down for several years year-on-year, and yet we have been growing.
 
What some people have missed is that with each new generation of equipment our content goes up significantly. So as we have made transitions to seeing deployment of 2G to 3G equipment, the actual dollar spent on the equipment may be flat, but the PLD content goes up dramatically, and therefore we grow at a much faster rate than the industry itself.
 
I would expect that trend to continue, because again, if you look into the LTE, we have a multiple of the dollar content that we had in 3G. So I think we are well-positioned to continue to see growth over the next several years within wireless and telecom.

Hi, John, just first a follow-up on the competitive dynamic between you and Xilinx. One of the things they are focused on is the opportunity at 45 nanometers, given that Cyclone IV is still a 60 nanometer products, and hence their ability to gain share.
 
I was wondering if you could specifically comment on that dynamic, and how you see that playing out, whether you feel you are disadvantaged because you are a process geometry behind.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
We do not feel we are disadvantaged at that process node. We actually have a Cyclone IV that we recently introduced. Its transceiver performance is rock-solid. We are continuing to win very well within the low-end space. I haven't really seen anything that is going to cause a tremendous marketshare shift one way or the other at this point within the low-end.
 
I think at the high-end we continue to have the momentum, and will certainly until 28 products are out. And even when then, I think, at the high-end we will have a much higher performance, higher density, much better transceiver story. So I would expect at the high-end we really will continue to do extremely well for years to come.
 
Remember, at the low-end it is not just Altera and Xilinx. We certainly have Lattice as a competitor there as well. And so we have many people in that space.

Sumit Dhanda

Okay, and then just as a follow-up, on the book to bill, my recollection was when you reported last quarter you said that it was flat quarter to date, and it eventually finished the quarter below 1. Does that suggest that relative to your sales trajectory for the last two months bookings were a little weaker or is that not really consequential?
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
Ron Pasek
- Altera Corporation - CFO
 
Yes, I guess the way -- what we said the last quarter at the earnings release was that for the quarter book to bill was above 1, but for the month of September it was slightly below 1. What we also indicated was that as -- we predicted as leadtimes shortened, bookings would tend to weaken in relation to shipments. So we expected the book to bill to be below 1. And that is all we are seeing. With good leadtimes we are seeing book to bill below 1 that's all.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
I think it is important to remember when -- what customers, their goal is to cover your leadtimes with the backlog. So if your leadtimes extend, they need to place more orders in order to extend the backlog coverage. When your leadtimes come back in, of course, they don't need to book as much, and so -- because they don't need to cover as long of a period of time.
 
The bookings, therefore, at times where you see changes in the leadtime are not a good indicator for what the underlying business is doing. So that is important to remember. That is why our business is doing okay, even though our book to bill may be below 1. It is just simply customers are reacting to the fact that they don't have to place as much backlog or have a backlog that goes out as far.

Thanks for taking my question. Ron, could you just tell me understand what is really going on in your network being business? It showed some solid strength here, 17%, and you are guiding that to be flat. You had three consecutive quarters of growth there. Help us understand what is going on in that space please.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ron Pasek
- Altera Corporation - CFO
 
So I think it is important to remember that networking is more than just a couple of US companies. There is also networking equipment that is being developed in other countries, number one. Number two, remember that we are growing marketshare content within these systems.
 
As another important metric overall networking was up very strongly in the quarter, as was computer and storage, I think, reflecting the fact that corporations and, even in some cases, carriers are returning to strong purchases or upgrades. And that is the driver, combined with the marketshare gains that we are seeing.

I can't really comment on any particular customer for this year for the same reason I can comment on what the end verticals may do this year. We simply don't know.
 
Because of the concentration of customers in the communications world and because communications are such a large marketplace in general for semiconductors, but also for programmable logic, I think it is natural that -- or it is very possible that you will see 10% plus customers from us at time to time. We have one now. I believe our competitor has one as well. And so it is possible. I am not overly concerned with it. But again can't really comment on what any particular customer is going to do for the full year.
 
Thank you, next question please.

John, just getting back to the long-term gross margin target of 65%. When I scan over the last 32 quarters, I only see about four or five quarters when you weren't operating above that longer-term target. I guess I'm trying to understand what is the mechanism that gets gross margins from current levels back down to target, especially in light of the fact that a big reason for ASIC replacement is that PLDs provide a tangible economic value to the customer that you should be able to share it.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
Well, I think 65% has been our long-term target that we have cited for many, many years, probably eight. We feel historically is a good balance between gross -- excuse me, growth and profitability. In other words, we don't want to limit our growth potential by trying to maximize gross margins. On the other side of the coin, we don't want to destroy the profitability of the Company just for growth sake.
 
So 65 has been a target that we have established, and we use that internally. I think for a series of reasons we have been able to operate above that level, either because of -- in vertical mix, because of the success of our products, because of cost reductions that we have been able to enjoy or put in place.
 
It is very hard to predict exactly where gross margins will be in a couple of years from now. Certainly, as Ron has said, I don't see anything in the near term which causes a tremendous change in the gross margins. But long-term 65% is still our comfortable long-term model, and we feel maybe over several years we may get there. It is possible we stay above, but again, we need to put out a long-term target, it still remains 65%.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Pitzer

Then, John, earlier you talked about a goal of doubling the growth of the semi industry. I am just kind of curious, with the step up in R&D around 28 nanometer this year, in part to broaden the product portfolio and get into new markets, would you expect that multiplier to go up as 28 starts to ship into volume, call it, a year, a year and a half from now?

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
John Pitzer
- Credit Suisse - Analyst
 
Yes, growth.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
Yes, I think the growth potential certainly is there for us as an industry to grow 2 X the overall ASIC, ASSP and embedded opportunity. Again, if you do the math, PLDs were only $5 billion last year, and yet the opportunity is probably close to 50. So you have the ability with 1% to literally grow our industry 10%.
 
So I think the opportunity is there to grow it at an extended rate. I think in particular for Altera we benefit two ways. Number one is we are an incumbent coming out of 40 nanometer. Number two, I think from what I have seen we have a much better, broader product portfolio in 28, which should allow us to address more of the ASIC and ASSP opportunities.
 
And, again as I mentioned earlier, do it more cost effectively, because we have different families that are optimized. Therefore our product costs, I think, should be better.
 
I think all put together should allow Altera to continue to grow faster than the other PLD companies and capture marketshare, but most importantly replace ASICs and ASSPs, and hopefully continue to grow at 2 X the overall semiconductor industry.

John, just getting back to your first question, I think it is fair, but I just want to remind you that in November what I tried to outline is the 65%, what I left you with was that would occur in 2015. So there is a lot that can happen between now and then. It is, in fact, a very long-term target.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
And separately when you're thinking about OpEx should we think about it being slightly higher in the first half of the year with the spend on 28 nanometer to get to your unchanged full-year targets, or how were you thinking about the way that that flows through the full year? Thank you.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ron Pasek
- Altera Corporation - CFO
 
So first of all, we only have one above 10% customer; that is Huawei. I would have to check the growth rate, but I am not sure it is 20% quarter-to-quarter.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
We listed Huawei also as greater than 10% customer last quarter. It was 14%. So the math is roughly clear that you can back into it. I apologize. I don't know the particular breakdown (multiple speakers).
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Tim Luke
- Barclays Capital - Analyst
 
I don't think you gave the exact percentage last time, so that is very helpful, yes.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ron Pasek
- Altera Corporation - CFO
 
To the last question you asked, I think what you should expect to see is a ramp of headcount through the year. And in that sense you should see probably the second half being higher in OpEx than the first half, just because of the way the hiring is occurring.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Tim Luke
- Barclays Capital - Analyst
 
To John, just generally, you have seen several strong quarters in a row, and now it seems that you're broadly seeing the leadtimes normalize and supply and demand come into equilibrium and revenue slightly lower sequentially.
 
Do you now off these high levels expect this year to be as growth year? And will it be a couple of quarters of absorbing the movement to normalize leadtimes, or do you feel that given what you have seen this as a one quarter period and you will return to your -- to growth engine?.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
John Daane
- Altera Corporation - CEO
 
Well, I can't comment specifically on the second calendar quarter. What I can say is we do expect to grow this year. We do expect to outgrow the semiconductor industry this year. We also expect to take marketshare within programmable logic this year.
 
The other comment I would make is the inventory that has been reported is only by a few customers so far, and is fairly minimal. And so with lead times now at a fairly normal level, you would expect those that have inventory positions would be reporting that, and obviously changing their order flow in the future so that they could pull that inventory down. And again, we are not hearing from a lot of customers that they have inventory -- a few.
 
So can't really say what that means for the second calendar quarter at this point. But again, we do expect to grow this year and outgrow the semiconductor industry.

We release software for our Stratix series, I believe, in second calendar quarter this year. It is in a press release, so we do have it out. It is still the only generally available software in PLDs for any product in 28 nanometer, so I think we have had a very substantial lead on that.
 
We did take out our first Stratix V product in the fourth calendar quarter in December. We are planning to sample that to customers this quarter in Q1.
 
Then we just announced the Arria V and Cyclone V families. You will see those arriving both in software format, and then later starting first with the Arria series with chips this year as well. So you'll see a lot of introductions across several different products from us in 28 nanometer, again, starting with Stratix V this quarter and sampling.

Thank you, Uche. I think we are probably coming up on the hour. I suspect we have time for one more question, if there is one more out there.

There is, sir. And we will take our final question from Ruben Roy, Pacific Crest Securities.

John, following up the 28 nanometer discussion, I was wondering if you could spend a minute or two on -- I understand the optimized families, but when you look at the high-end of your product families, the Stratix, can you give us a little bit of information on where you see the differentiation using the HP process, the TSM versus what Xilinx seems to be using at HPL? Thank you.

Well, I think the first thing is performance. HP is -- it stands for high performance. It is what the FPGAs and GPUs, for instance, have been built on for many generations. I think if you put a high-end family on a low-power process technology, low-power means also low performance. So the downside is you are simply not going to have the performance.
 
You add something like a 28 gig transceiver, which we have and have demonstrated to customers -- once you bring that performance rate into the chip you need to have a high-performance fabric and memories to be able to handle that much data that quickly.
 
I would suspect there will be challenges trying to shoehorn a low-power process technology product into the high-end. So we are simply doing what we have done for many generations, and for that matter, what our competition has done for many generations.
 
We have estimated the high-end is probably 60% of the business, the low-end is probably 40%. So it is not an insignificant part of the business at all. And we think by continuing what we have done in the past we actually enter the high-end with an extreme advantage, and performance rates in particular, Both with transceivers and the overall fabric performance of the devices.
 
I would say in general, just going back to the comment on -- just something struck me. Remember, we do a methodology which has been traditionally different from what our competitors have done in that we do prototypes or test chips along the way so that we can prove out each piece of the technology, which is why in the third and fourth calendar quarters as we were able to demonstrate our 28 gig transceiver operating in a 28 nanometer process technology.
 
There is no other such transceiver -- in fact, there is no transceiver that is operating today in 28 nanometer, other than our device. This allows us to see each piece and know that by the time that we put this all together that we have proven the technology out. We have tuned and that the first chip should be very solid.
 
So employing that strategy yet again on 28 nanometer gives us a feeling that our products will be pretty rock-solid and should be able to easily start to sample that product in the first calendar quarter.

Thanks for that, John. If I could just really quickly get a follow-up around the Avalon acquisition. Was that driven by a specific customer program near-term or kind of general IP acquisition for a longer-term at Altera? Thanks very much.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Jan 25, 2011 / 09:45PM GMT, ALTR - Q4 2010 Altera Corporation Earnings Conference Call
We have done really well in the OTN applications because of the transceiver performance requirements. We really haven't had any competition to a large extent in that space.
 
We had many customers using the Avalon IP actually to implement their OTN applications, 40 gig, 100 gig. And we felt the technology was very extensible to the 400 gig range, which customers are starting to work on now.
 
And so we felt with the Avalon technology we could actually extend our IP and start replacing some other ASSPs potentially that were coming to market, and broaden our business base. And so that is why we did the acquisition.
 
I think it is a space we are doing very well in, again, because of the transceiver performance that we had and the good partnership we had with Avalon on the IP. This just brings it all together and allows us to, I think, do more ASSP replacements as a product strategy going forward.

Thanks, Ruben. As we wrap up today, let me mention that we will attend two industry conferences this quarter -- the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference March 2 in San Francisco, and the Raymond James 32nd Annual Institutional Investors Conference in Orlando on March 8.
 
This concludes Altera's earnings conference call. Thanks for your interest and participation.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
(e)    The following is a description of Altera's 2011 Bonus Plan provided pursuant to Paragraph 10(iii) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, which requires a written description of a compensatory plan when no formal document contains the compensation information.
 
On February 28, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Altera adopted Altera's Bonus Plan for the 2011 fiscal year. The purpose of the 2011 Bonus Plan is to promote the interests of Altera and its stockholders by providing key employees with financial rewards upon achievement of specified business objectives, as well as help Altera attract and retain key employees by providing attractive compensation opportunities linked to performance results.
 
Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the three other most-highly-compensated officers, as well as all other executive officers, are eligible to participate in the 2011 Bonus Plan. Bonuses payable to our CEO and other officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, referred to collectively as the Executive Officers, under the 2011 Bonus Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee.
 
The Target and Maximum 2011 Bonus Plan Payouts, both of which are a percentage of base salary that may be earned by each of our Executive Officers are as follows:
 
 
The exact amount payable to an Executive Officer under the 2011 Bonus Plan will be determined at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. In exercising its discretion, the Compensation Committee will take into account Altera's operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2011, referred to as the Operating Margin Metric, Altera's percent of revenue growth in 2011 as compared to 2010, referred to as the Revenue Growth Metric, and collectively with the Operating Margin Metric, the Financial Performance Metrics, and the individual Executive Officer's performance during the year. The Operating Margin Metric and the Revenue Growth Metric will each determine a Financial Performance Metric Potential Payout Percentage (as specified in the table below) that may be earned by an Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee will then have the discretion to increase, decrease or eliminate the amount payable under the 2011 Bonus Plan based on the individual's performance during the year, including his or her performance against goals that have been approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have the discretion to make a Bonus Payout under the 2011 Bonus Plan even if the Potential Payout Percentage is 0%.
 
For the purposes of determining the Operating Margin Metric, operating income is defined as earnings before interest and other income, interest expense, and taxes (including the expense associated with the 2011 Bonus Plan Payout) divided by Net Sales.
 
For the purposes of determining the Operating Margin Metric and the Revenue Growth Metric, Net Sales is defined consistently with the convention used in Altera's reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
 
 
The Compensation Committee shall have discretion to exclude significant, non-recurring items, as well as amounts attributable to Altera's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metrics. Significant non-recurring transactions are defined as items that could have a material effect on the outcome of the calculated bonus, are unusual in nature and occur infrequently. For purposes of the calculation, items are deemed to have a material effect if they have a positive or negative impact on Net Sales or operating margin income of greater than 1% of net sales or $10 million for the full year impact (net of any resulting dollar savings) of each type of unusual or infrequently occurring item (whether they occur in one or more transactions). Unusual in nature refers to those transactions or events that possess a high degree of abnormality and are of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of Altera and the industry. Infrequency of occurrence refers to events or transactions of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future based on the nature of the company's normal operations and the industry. Examples of significant, non-recurring items that the Compensation Committee may elect to exclude from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metrics include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) restructuring charges as defined by US GAAP; (2) business combinations as defined by US GAAP; (3) asset impairment or discontinuation of operations recognized under US GAAP; (4) earthquake, tsunami, flood, hurricane, typhoon, or fire resulting in an expense recognized under US GAAP; and (5) other significant non-recurring transactions as appropriate.
 
A 2011 Bonus Plan Payout percentage will be determined for each Executive Officer according to the following formula:
 
(Operating Margin Metric Payout Percentage * 75%) + (Revenue Growth Metric Payout Percentage * 25%) * Bonus Target Percentage = Bonus Payout Percentage
 
The Bonus Plan Payout Percentage will then be multiplied by the Executive Officer's base salary to determine a potential Bonus Payout Amount. The Compensation Committee will then have the discretion to increase (up to the Bonus Plan Maximum Payout Percentage), decrease or eliminate the actual amount payable under the 2011 Bonus Plan based on the Executive Officer's performance during the year, including his or her performance against goals that have been approved by the Compensation Committee.
 
The Bonus Plan Payout Percentage will be calculated based on the following table:
 
If the results of the Financial Performance Metrics do not appear on the above table, the applicable Financial Performance Metric Payout Percentage shall be calculated on a proportional basis. For example, if 2011 operating income as a percentage of revenue is 32.5%, the Operating Margin Metric Payout Percentage will be 105%.
 
In evaluating the performance of the Executive Officers other than the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEO's evaluation of whether an individual has met his or her performance goals and the CEO's subjective assessment of overall performance. In evaluating the performance of the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEO's self-assessment as well as the assessment of the independent members of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee's determination as to whether individual performance goals have been met may be subjective in nature.
 
Payment of bonuses (if any) will be made in February or March of 2012. Bonuses normally will be paid in cash in a single lump sum.

Only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the annual meeting.

Section 2.2. Special Meetings.
Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the Lead Independent Director, or one or more record holders of shares of stock of the Corporation representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the total number of shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting (the Voting Stock). A stockholder request for a special meeting shall be directed to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation's principal executive offices and shall be signed by each stockholder, or a duly authorized agent of such stockholder, requesting the special meeting and shall be accompanied by a notice setting forth the information required by Section 2.10 or Section 2.11, as applicable, of Article II of these By-laws, as to any nominations proposed to be presented and any other business proposed to be conducted at such special meeting and as to the stockholder(s) requesting the special meeting. In addition to the information required by Section 2.10 or Section 2.11, as applicable, of Article II of these By-laws, the special meeting request shall include (i) an acknowledgement by such stockholder(s) that any disposition of shares of the Voting Stock held of record by such stockholder(s) as of the date of delivery of the special meeting request and prior to the record date for the proposed special meeting of stockholders requested by such stockholder(s) shall constitute a revocation of such request with respect to such shares, and (ii) documentary evidence that the requesting stockholder(s) own in the aggregate the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary; provided, however, that if the requesting stockholder(s) are not the beneficial owner(s) of the shares representing the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, then to be valid, the written request must also include documentary evidence that the beneficial owner(s) on whose behalf the special meeting request is made beneficially own the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary. In addition, the requesting stockholder(s) and the beneficial owner(s), if any, shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation.
1
 
 
A special meeting requested by stockholder(s) shall be held at such date, time and place within or without the state of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any such special meeting shall be not more than 90 days after the request to call the special meeting by the stockholder(s) who satisfy the requirements of this Section 2.2 is received by the Secretary, unless a later date is required in order to allow the Corporation to file the information required under Item 8 (or any comparable or successor provision) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), if applicable.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a special meeting requested by the stockholder(s) shall not be held if: (i) the request for the special meeting does not comply with the provisions of these By-laws, (ii) the stated business to be brought before the special meeting is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law, (iii) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual meeting of stockholders to be held within 90 days after the Secretary receives the request for the special meeting and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the business of such annual meeting includes (among any other matters properly brought before the annual meeting) the business specified in the stockholder(s)' request for a special meeting, (iv) an annual or special meeting of stockholders that included an identical or substantially similar item of business (Similar Business), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, was held not more than 120 days before the special meeting request was received by the Secretary, or (v) the special meeting request was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law. For purposes of this Section 2.2, the election of directors shall be deemed to be Similar Business with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors, changing the size of the Board of Directors and filing of vacancies and/or newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors.
 
In determining whether a special meeting of stockholders has been requested by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, multiple special meeting requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together only if (i) each request identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the proposed special meeting and substantially the same matters proposed to be acted on at the proposed special meeting (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), and (ii) such request(s) have been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated special meeting request.
 
A stockholder may revoke a request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, and if, following such revocation, there are un-revoked requests from stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the requisite number of Voting Stock entitling the stockholder(s) to request the calling of a special meeting, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may cancel the special meeting. If none of the stockholder(s) who submitted the request for a special meeting appears or sends a qualified representative to present the nominations proposed to be presented or other business proposed to be conducted at the special meeting, the Corporation need not present such nominations or other business for a vote at such meeting.
 
Business transacted at all special meetings shall be confined to the matter(s) stated in the notice of special meeting. Business transacted at a special meeting requested by stockholders shall be limited to the matter(s) described in the special meeting request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matter(s) to the stockholders at any special meeting requested by stockholder(s).
 
The Chair of a special meeting shall determine all matter(s) relating to the conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, determining whether any nomination or other item of business has been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these By-laws, and if the Chair should so determine and declare that any nomination or other item of business has not been properly brought before the special meeting, then such business shall not be transacted at such meeting.
 
Special meetings of stockholders may not be called by any person or persons other than as specified by this Section 2.2.
 
Section 2.3. Notice of Meetings.
Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than 10 days (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

Section 2.4. Adjournments.
Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
 
Section 2.5. Quorum.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of these By-laws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
 
Section 2.6. Organization.
Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in his absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
 
Section 2.7. Voting; Proxies.
Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot; provided, however, that any election for directors must be by ballot if demanded by any stockholder at the meeting before the election has begun. Voting for the election of directors at any meeting of stockholders shall be as specified in Section 3.3 of these Bylaws. All other matters presented to the stockholders for a vote, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.
 
Section 2.8. Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting and (2)  in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
Section 2.9. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote.
The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any
3
 
stockholder who is present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of directors, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 2.10. Stockholder Proposals at Any Meeting of Stockholders.
At a meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a meeting of stockholders, business must be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by stockholder(s). In addition to any other applicable requirements for business to be properly brought before a meeting by stockholder(s), whether or not the stockholder(s) are seeking to have a proposal included in the Corporation's proxy statement or information statement under any applicable rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including, but not limited to, Regulation 14A or Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act, the stockholder(s) must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, in the case of stockholder(s) seeking to have a proposal included in the Corporation's proxy statement or information statement, stockholder(s)' notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not less than 120 days or more than 180 days prior to the first anniversary (the Anniversary) of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, then notice by the stockholder(s) to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. If the stockholder(s) are not seeking inclusion of a proposal in the Corporation's proxy statement or information statement but nonetheless intend to present such proposal at the annual meeting, timely notice consists of stockholder(s)' notice delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Other than with respect to stockholder proposals relating to director nomination(s) which requirements are set forth in Section 2.11 below, stockholder(s)' notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder(s) propose to bring before the meeting of stockholders: (i) a brief description of the business the stockholder(s) desire to bring before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder(s) proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder(s), (iv) any material interest of the stockholder(s) in such business; (v) as to the stockholder(s) giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including, but not limited to, any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss or increase profit to or manage the risk or benefit of stock price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder(s) or any such Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation (each, a Relevant Hedge Transaction), and (vi) as to the stockholder(s) giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person, to the extent not set forth pursuant to the immediately preceding clause, (a) whether and the extent to which such stockholder(s) or Stockholder Associated Person has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise, or any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation (a Derivative Instrument), (b) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder(s) that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (c) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder(s) are a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (d) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder(s) are entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder(s)' immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder(s) and beneficial owner(s), if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date).
For purposes of this Section 2.10 and Section 2.11, Stockholder Associated Person of any stockholder shall mean (i) any person controlling or controlled by, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and (iii) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Stockholder Associated Person.

The Chairman of a meeting of stockholders shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10 and the other provisions of these By-laws, and if the Chairman should so determine he or she shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

Such nominations shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation's principal executive offices in accordance with these By-laws.

In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.

At the first annual meeting of stockholders and at each annual meeting thereafter, the stockholders shall elect directors by a majority of the votes cast unless the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, in which case the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares entitled to vote on the election of directors and represented in person or by proxy at such meeting casting their vote for a director must exceed the number of such votes cast against that director. If a nominee for director, who is not serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall not be elected. If a nominee for director, who is serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall then make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the reasons for it within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.
 
Each director shall hold office for a term of one year or until such time as his successor is elected and qualified. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at the election of directors. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. Any newly created directorship resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, failure to receive a majority of the votes cast at an election of directors, removal from office or any other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of
 
6
 
the remaining members of the Board of Directors, though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced or until his successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the whole Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

If the notice is delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph, it shall be delivered at least 48
hours before the time of the holding of the special meeting. If by facsimile transmission, such notice shall be transmitted at least 24 hours before the time of holding of the special meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of the special meeting or the place of the special meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal office of the Corporation.
 
Section 3.6. Telephonic Meetings Permitted.
Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
 
Section 3.7. Quorum; Vote Required for Action; Adjournment.
At all meetings of the Board of Directors fifty percent (50%) of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except in cases in which the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws otherwise provide, the vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours.

Section 3.9. Informal Action by Directors.
Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.
 
Section 3.10. Fees and Compensation of Directors.
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. This Section 3.10 shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise and receiving compensation for those services.
 
Section 3.11. Approval of Loans to Officers.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the Corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the Corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the Corporation. To the extent permitted by applicable law, such loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the Corporation.

Section 7.2. Prepayment of Expenses.
The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that the payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII or otherwise.
 
Section 7.3. Claims.
If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Article VII is not paid in full within 60 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.
 
Section 7.4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights.
The rights conferred on any person by this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
 
Section 8.4. Interested Directors; Quorum.
No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders.

ALTERA UPDATES THIRD QUARTER SALES GUIDANCE
San Jose, Calif
., September 6, 2011 - Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced updated third quarter 2011 sales guidance. The company currently expects third quarter sales to be in the range of down 3 percent to up 1 percent versus second quarter sales. Previous guidance was for sales growth of 2 percent to 6 percent.
Relative to initial guidance, demand is weaker in several vertical markets including Telecom and Wireless, particularly outside Asia, as well as Industrial Automation, Military, and Test as customers are moderating their purchases in light of macroeconomic uncertainty and other near term changes to their business environment. Despite this broader trend, Altera's new products will be up sequentially.
The company will announce third quarter results after the market close on October 20, 2011.

ALTERA UPDATES FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE GUIDANCE
San Jose, Calif
., December 8, 2011  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced updated fourth quarter 2011 revenue guidance.
The company currently expects that fourth quarter revenue will be 13 to 16 percent lower than third quarter levels. Previous guidance was for a decline of 7 to 11 percent. The revenue outlook has deteriorated across all major vertical markets, including both large and small customers. With the exception of North America, which will benefit from rising military sales, all geographic regions will be weak. As the quarter has progressed, economic uncertainty, macroeconomic concerns, and, in some instances, lower than planned sales have resulted in customers reducing demand on Altera. Consistent with the third quarter, Altera believes it will continue to under ship customer end demand in the fourth quarter.
The company will report fourth quarter results on January 24, 2012.

ALTERA ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
San Jose, Calif

$457.8 million
, down
12 percent
from the third quarter of 2011 and down
18 percent
from the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter net income was
$146.6 million
,
$0.45
per diluted share, compared with net income of
$185.4 million
,
$0.57
per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011 and
$231.6 million
,
$0.72
per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Cash flow from operating activities in 2011 was
$959.6 million

Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.08
per share payable on March 1, 2012 to stockholders of record on February 10, 2012.
"While industry conditions led to sequential sales declines in the fourth quarter, Altera grew 6 percent in 2011well ahead of most of the semiconductor industry. Our FPGA market share once again improved," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "As we have seen over the last several years, there are long-term technology-based trends that favor FPGAs. We continue to believe that these factors, plus ongoing FPGA share gains, give us the potential over time for sales growth twice that of the semiconductor industry."

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)    The following is a description of Altera's 2012 Bonus Plan provided pursuant to Paragraph 10(iii) to Item 601 of Regulation SK, which requires a written description of a compensatory plan when no formal document contains the compensation information.
On February 7, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Altera Corporation ("Altera") adopted Altera's Bonus Plan for the 2012 fiscal year. The purpose of the 2012 Bonus Plan is to promote the interests of Altera and its stockholders by providing key employees with financial rewards upon achievement of specified business objectives, as well as to help Altera attract and retain key employees by providing attractive compensation opportunities linked to performance results.
Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the three other most-highly-compensated officers, as well as all other executive officers, are eligible to participate in the 2012 Bonus Plan. Bonuses payable to our CEO and other officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, the "Executive Officers"), under the 2012 Bonus Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee.
The target and maximum 2012 Bonus Plan payouts, each of which are a percentage of base salary that may be earned by each of our Executive Officers, are as follows:
The exact amount payable to an Executive Officer under the 2012 Bonus Plan will be determined at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. In exercising its discretion, the Compensation Committee will take into account Altera's operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2012 (the "Operating Margin Metric"), Altera's percent of revenue growth in 2012 as compared to 2011 (the "Revenue Growth Metric" and, together with the Operating Margin Metric, the "Financial Performance Metrics") and the individual Executive Officer's performance during the year. Each Financial Performance Metric will determine a Financial Performance Metric Payout Percentage (as specified in the table below) which will, in turn, determine the Bonus Plan payout percentage that may be earned by an Executive Officer.
For the purposes of determining the Operating Margin Metric, operating income is defined as earnings before interest and other income, interest expense, and taxes (including the expense associated with the 2012 Bonus Plan payout) divided by Net Sales.
For the purposes of determining the Operating Margin Metric and the Revenue Growth Metric, Net Sales is defined consistently with the convention used in Altera's reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Compensation Committee shall have discretion to exclude significant, non-recurring items, as well as amounts attributable to Altera's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metrics. Significant non-recurring transactions are defined as items that could have a material effect on the outcome of the calculated bonus, are unusual in nature and occur infrequently. For purposes of the calculation, items are deemed to have a material effect if they have a positive or negative impact on Net Sales or operating margin income of greater than 1% of net sales or $10 million for the full-year impact (net of any resulting dollar savings) of each type of unusual or infrequently occurring item (whether they occur in one or more transactions). Unusual in nature refers to those transactions or events that possess a high degree of abnormality and are of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of Altera and the industry. Infrequency of occurrence refers to events or transactions of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future based on the nature of the company's normal operations and the industry. Examples of significant, non-recurring items that the Compensation Committee may elect to exclude from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metrics include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) restructuring charges as defined by U.S. GAAP; (2) business combinations as defined by U.S. GAAP; (3) asset impairment or discontinuation of operations recognized under U.S. GAAP; (4) earthquake, tsunami, flood, hurricane, typhoon, or fire resulting in an expense recognized under U.S. GAAP; and (5) other significant non-recurring transactions as appropriate.
A 2012 Bonus Plan payout percentage will be determined for each Executive Officer according to the following formula:
(Operating Margin Metric Payout Percentage * 60%) + (Revenue Growth Metric Payout Percentage * 40%) * Bonus Target Percentage = Bonus Plan Payout Percentage
The Bonus Plan payout percentage will be multiplied by the Executive Officer's base salary to determine a potential Bonus Plan payout. The Compensation Committee will then have the discretion to increase (up to the Bonus Plan maximum payout percentage), decrease or eliminate the actual amount payable under the 2012 Bonus Plan based on the Executive Officer's performance during the year, including his or her performance against goals that have been approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have the discretion to make a Bonus Plan payout under the 2012 Bonus Plan even if the Bonus Plan payout percentage is 0%.
The Bonus Plan payout percentage will be calculated based on the following table:
If the results of a Financial Performance Metric do not appear on the above table, the applicable Financial Performance Metric Payout Percentage shall be calculated on a proportional basis. For example, if 2012 operating income as a percentage of revenue is 40.5%, the Operating Margin Metric Payout Percentage will be 130%.
In evaluating the performance of the Executive Officers other than the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEO's evaluation of whether an individual has met his or her performance goals and the CEO's subjective assessment of overall performance. In evaluating the performance of the CEO, the Compensation Committee may take into account the CEO's self-assessment as well as the assessment of the independent members of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee's determination as to whether individual performance goals have been met may be subjective in nature.
Payment of bonuses (if any) will be made in February or March of 2013. Bonuses normally will be paid in cash in a single lump sum.

ALTERA UPDATES FIRST QUARTER REVENUE GUIDANCE
 
San Jose, Calif
., March 8, 2012 - Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced updated first quarter 2012 revenue guidance.
 
Initial guidance for the first quarter was for a 5 to 9 percent sequential revenue decline, largely the result of program timing in the military vertical market and continued softness in sales to wireless customers. As the quarter has progressed, the company has experienced somewhat more pronounced and broader than anticipated inventory adjustment related weakness and now believes that first quarter revenue will be 7 to 9 percent lower than fourth quarter levels.
 
The company continues to expect that revenue in the second quarter of 2012 will be above first quarter levels. Quarter-to-date book to bill remains above 1.0.
First quarter results will be released after the market close on April 19, 2012.

ALTERA ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
San Jose, Calif
.,
April 19, 2012
 Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced first quarter sales of
$383.8 million
, down
16 percent
from the fourth quarter of 2011 and down
28 percent
from the first quarter of 2011. First quarter net income was
$115.8 million
,
$0.35
per diluted share, compared with net income of
$146.6 million
,
$0.45
per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2011 and
$224.1 million
,
$0.68
per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011.
Cash flow from operating activities was
$89.8 million
. Altera repurchased 220,449 shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $8.2 million. Altera ended the quarter with $
3.6 billion
in cash and investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share payable on June 1, 2012 to stockholders of record on May 10, 2012.
 
"Demand in the last month of the quarter was generally lighter than forecasted, particularly from customers in the communications vertical market. In addition, we experienced some mix issues as we attempted to fulfill orders that arrived in the last month of the quarter. These factors were the major contributors to quarterly revenue that was well below our previous outlook. As we enter the second quarter, our backlog position has significantly improved reflecting stronger demand for our products. We expect a rebound in our business in the second quarter," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Our portfolio of 28-nm FPGAs is displaying strong design-win momentum. We continue to benefit from both our incumbency position and a tailored architecture approach that optimizes the performance of each of our 28-nm FPGA families."
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress:

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (when taken together with the Preliminary Prospectus) or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information identified in the Underwriting Agreement as being provided by the Underwriters.
Indemnification of the Company.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
Notice and Procedures.

actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and
Contribution.
 
commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.
pro rata
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
8. . This Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
 
9. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in the Underwriting Agreement that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
 
10. (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of any offering by, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.; and (ix) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors. It is understood, however, except as provided in Section 7 and this Section 10, that the Underwriters will pay all of their costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of their counsel, transfer taxes payable on resale of any of the Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
Payment of Expenses.
(b) If the Company fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters for any reason other than the Underwriters' failure to perform their obligations under this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement) or the Underwriters decline or fail to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under Section 6 or Section 9 of this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
11. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Indenture
On May 8, 2012, Altera Corporation (the "") entered into an indenture (the ""), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ""), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture (the "", and together with the Base Indenture, the ""), relating to the issuance by the Company of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750% Senior Notes due 2017 (the ""). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.750% per annum on the principal amount thereof. Interest on the Notes accrues from May 8, 2012 and is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2012. The Notes will mature on May 15, 2017, subject to earlier repurchase or redemption as described below.
Company
Base Indenture
Trustee
Supplemental Indenture
Indenture
Notes
The Notes are the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, ranking equally in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of the Company's future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes. The Notes are effectively subordinated to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries (including trade payables).
The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time for cash at the redemption prices described in the Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of their Notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The Indenture contains customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create specified liens on principal property and the stock of certain subsidiaries of the Company, and restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions of principal property. In addition, the Indenture limits the ability of the Company to consolidate with or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Indenture.
The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants, certain payment defaults at final maturity or acceleration of other indebtedness and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency with respect to the Company. If an event of default with respect to the Notes occurs and is continuing, subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the holders), declare to be immediately due and payable the principal of, accrued and unpaid interest, and premium, if any, on the Notes. In the case of an event of default resulting from events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, such amounts with respect to the Notes will be due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the Notes.
The description of the Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Base Indenture, Supplemental Indenture and form of Note, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company repaid in full, and terminated the commitments under, the Credit Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2007, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender, and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant

In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
(b) If all or less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 15 days' written notice (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee or specified in the supplemental indenture for such series of Securities) in advance of the date the Company gives notice to the Securityholders of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series to be redeemed.

Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith, by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, shall determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series, may rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default with respect to such series and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except (i) a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series; or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Altera Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 26, 2012 of a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement"), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), that is automatically effective under the Act pursuant to Rule 462(e) promulgated thereunder. The Registration Statement relates to the proposed issuance and sale, from time to time, by the Company of senior debt securities with an indeterminate amount as may at various times be issued at indeterminate prices, in reliance on Rule 456(b) and Rule 457(e) under the Act.
Under the Registration Statement, the Company has issued $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 1.750% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of May 8, 2012 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 8, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Notes were sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated May 1, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined the Registration Statement, together with the exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein; the base prospectus, dated April 26, 2012, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein, filed with the Registration Statement (the "Base Prospectus"); the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated May 1, 2012, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Act relating to the offering of the Notes; the final prospectus supplement, dated May 1, 2012, in the form filed with Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Act relating to the offering of the Notes (collectively with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus Supplement"); the Indenture and the Notes. In addition, we have examined such other instruments, documents, certificates and records which we have deemed relevant and necessary for the basis of our opinion hereinafter expressed. In such examination, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of original documents and the genuineness of all signatures; (ii) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies; (iii) the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents, instruments and certificates we have reviewed; (iv) the Underwriting Agreement has

been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the parties thereto (other than the Company); (v) the legal capacity of all natural persons; and (vi) that the Trustee has the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture and that the Indenture will be a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that were not independently established or verified, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company.
We express no opinion as to any matter relating to laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York, as such are in effect on the date hereof.
We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) rights to indemnification and contribution which may be limited by applicable law or equitable principles, or (iii) the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, the effect of judicial discretion and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, and limitations on rights of acceleration, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
On the basis of the foregoing and in reliance thereon and having regard for legal considerations which we deem relevant, and subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we advise you that in our opinion the Notes constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the above-referenced Registration Statement and to the use of our name wherever it appears in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and in any amendment or supplement thereto. In giving such consent, we do not believe that we are "experts" within the meaning of such term as used in the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this opinion as an exhibit or otherwise.

STOCKHOLDERS
Section 2.1. Annual Meetings.
An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time. Only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the annual meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.
Section 2.2. Special Meetings.
Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of
1
the Board of Directors, the President, the Lead Independent Director, or one or more record holders of shares of stock of the Corporation representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the total number of shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting (the Voting Stock). A stockholder request for a special meeting shall be directed to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporations principal executive offices and shall be signed by each stockholder, or a duly authorized agent of such stockholder, requesting the special meeting and shall be accompanied by a notice setting forth the information required by Section 2.10 or Section 2.11, as applicable, of Article II of these By-laws, as to any nominations proposed to be presented and any other business proposed to be conducted at such special meeting and as to the stockholder(s) requesting the special meeting. In addition to the information required by Section 2.10 or Section 2.11, as applicable, of Article II of these By-laws, the special meeting request shall include (i) an acknowledgement by such stockholder(s) that any disposition of shares of the Voting Stock held of record by such stockholder(s) as of the date of delivery of the special meeting request and prior to the record date for the proposed special meeting of stockholders requested by such stockholder(s) shall constitute a revocation of such request with respect to such shares, and (ii) documentary evidence that the requesting stockholder(s) own in the aggregate the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary; provided, however, that if the requesting stockholder(s) are not the beneficial owner(s) of the shares representing the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, then to be valid, the written request must also include documentary evidence that the beneficial owner(s) on whose behalf the special meeting request is made beneficially own the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary. In addition, the requesting stockholder(s) and the beneficial owner(s), if any, shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation.
A special meeting requested by stockholder(s) shall be held at such date, time and place within or without the state of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any such special meeting shall be not more than 90 days after the request to call the special meeting by the stockholder(s) who satisfy the requirements of this Section 2.2 is received by the Secretary, unless a later date is required in order to allow the Corporation to file the information required under Item 8 (or any comparable or successor provision) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), if applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a special meeting requested by the stockholder(s) shall not be held if: (i) the request for the special meeting does not comply with the provisions of these By-laws, (ii) the stated business to be brought before the special meeting is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law, (iii) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual meeting of stockholders to be held within 90 days after the Secretary receives the request for the special meeting and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the business of such annual meeting includes (among any other matters properly brought before the annual meeting) the business specified in the stockholder(s) request for a special meeting, (iv) an annual or special meeting of stockholders that included an identical or substantially similar item of business (Similar Business), as determined in
2
good faith by the Board of Directors, was held not more than 120 days before the special meeting request was received by the Secretary, or (v) the special meeting request was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law. For purposes of this Section 2.2, the election of directors shall be deemed to be Similar Business with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors, changing the size of the Board of Directors and filing of vacancies and/or newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors.
In determining whether a special meeting of stockholders has been requested by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, multiple special meeting requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together only if (i) each request identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the proposed special meeting and substantially the same matters proposed to be acted on at the proposed special meeting (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), and (ii) such request(s) have been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated special meeting request.
A stockholder may revoke a request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, and if, following such revocation, there are un-revoked requests from stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the requisite number of Voting Stock entitling the stockholder(s) to request the calling of a special meeting, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may cancel the special meeting. If none of the stockholder(s) who submitted the request for a special meeting appears or sends a qualified representative to present the nominations proposed to be presented or other business proposed to be conducted at the special meeting, the Corporation need not present such nominations or other business for a vote at such meeting.
Business transacted at all special meetings shall be confined to the matter(s) stated in the notice of special meeting. Business transacted at a special meeting requested by stockholders shall be limited to the matter(s) described in the special meeting request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matter(s) to the stockholders at any special meeting requested by stockholder(s).
The Chair of a special meeting shall determine all matter(s) relating to the conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, determining whether any nomination or other item of business has been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these By-laws, and if the Chair should so determine and declare that any nomination or other item of business has not been properly brought before the special meeting, then such business shall not be transacted at such meeting.
Special meetings of stockholders may not be called by any person or persons other than as specified by this Section 2.2.
Section 2.3. Notice of Meetings.
Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that
3
shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than 10 days (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 2.4. Adjournments.
Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 2.5. Quorum.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of these By-laws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Section 2.6. Organization.
Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in his absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 2.7. Voting; Proxies.
Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is
4
coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot; provided, however, that any election for directors must be by ballot if demanded by any stockholder at the meeting before the election has begun. Voting for the election of directors at any meeting of stockholders shall be as specified in Section 3.3 of these Bylaws. All other matters presented to the stockholders for a vote, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.
Section 2.8. Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting and (2)  in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Section 2.9. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote.
The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of directors, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine
5
the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
Section 2.10. Stockholder Proposals at Any Meeting of Stockholders.
At a meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a meeting of stockholders, business must be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by stockholder(s). In addition to any other applicable requirements for business to be properly brought before a meeting by stockholder(s), whether or not the stockholder(s) are seeking to have a proposal included in the Corporations proxy statement or information statement under any applicable rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including, but not limited to, Regulation 14A or Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act, the stockholder(s) must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, in the case of stockholder(s) seeking to have a proposal included in the Corporations proxy statement or information statement, stockholder(s) notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporations principal executive offices not less than 120 days or more than 180 days prior to the first anniversary (the Anniversary) of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the previous years annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, then notice by the stockholder(s) to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporations principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. If the stockholder(s) are not seeking inclusion of a proposal in the Corporations proxy statement or information statement but nonetheless intend to present such proposal at the annual meeting, timely notice consists of stockholder(s) notice delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. Other than with respect to stockholder proposals relating to director nomination(s) which requirements are set forth in Section 2.11 below, stockholder(s) notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder(s) propose to bring before the meeting of stockholders: (i) a brief description of the business the stockholder(s) desire to bring before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder(s) proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder(s), (iv) any material interest of the stockholder(s) in such business; (v) as to the stockholder(s) giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below), whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including, but not limited to, any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss or increase profit to or manage the risk or benefit of stock price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such
6
stockholder(s) or any such Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation (each, a Relevant Hedge Transaction), and (vi) as to the stockholder(s) giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person, to the extent not set forth pursuant to the immediately preceding clause, (a) whether and the extent to which such stockholder(s) or Stockholder Associated Person has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise, or any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation (a Derivative Instrument), (b) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder(s) that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (c) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder(s) are a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (d) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder(s) are entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder(s) immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder(s) and beneficial owner(s), if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date).
For purposes of this Section 2.10 and Section 2.11, Stockholder Associated Person of any stockholder shall mean (i) any person controlling or controlled by, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and (iii) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Stockholder Associated Person.
The Chairman of a meeting of stockholders shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10 and the other provisions of these By-laws, and if the Chairman should so determine he or she shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
Nothing in this Section 2.10 shall affect the right of a stockholder to request inclusion of a proposal in the Corporations proxy statement to the extent that such right is provided by an applicable law.
Section 2.11. Nominations of Persons For Election to the Board of Directors.
In addition to any other applicable requirements, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors.
7
Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board of Directors or by stockholder(s) of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who comply with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 and the other provisions of these By-laws. Such nominations shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporations principal executive offices in accordance with these By-laws. To be timely, in the case of stockholder(s) seeking to have a nomination included in the Corporations proxy statement or information statement, stockholder(s) notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than 120 days or more than 180 days prior to the first Anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the previous years annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, then notice by stockholder(s) to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporations principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. If the stockholder(s) are not seeking inclusion of a nomination in the Corporations proxy statement or information statement but nonetheless intend to present such nomination at the annual meeting, timely notice consists of stockholder(s) notice delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. The stockholder(s) notice relating to director nomination(s) shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder(s) propose to nominate for election or re-election as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the person, and (iv) any other information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; (b) as to the stockholder(s) giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of the stockholder(s), and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder(s); (c) as to the stockholder(s) giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined in Section 2.10), to the extent not set forth pursuant to the immediately preceding clause, whether and the extent to which any Relevant Hedge Transaction (as defined in Section 2.10) has been entered into, and (d) as to the stockholder(s) giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person, (1) whether and the extent to which any Derivative Instrument (as defined in Section 2.10) is directly or indirectly beneficially owned, (2) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder(s) that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (3) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder(s) are a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (4) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder(s) are entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if
8
any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder(s) immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder(s) and beneficial owner(s), if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date). The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these By-laws.
The Chairman of a meeting of stockholders shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.11 and the other provisions of these By-laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
Section 2.12. Action By Written Consent of Stockholders.
(a) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders or may be effected by a consent in writing by stockholders as provided by, and subject to the limitations in, the Certificate of Incorporation and this Section 2.12.
(b) A request by a stockholder for a record date in accordance with Article Eighth of the Certificate of Incorporation must be delivered by the holders of record of at least twenty percent (20%) (the Voting Stock) of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to express consent on the relevant action, must describe the action that the stockholder proposes to take by consent (the Action) and must contain (i) the text of the proposal (including the text of any resolutions to be effected by consent), (ii) the information required by Section 2.2 of these bylaws, to the extent applicable, as though the stockholder(s) making the request were making a Special Meeting Request in furtherance of the Action, (iii) an acknowledgment by such stockholder(s) that any disposition of shares of the Voting Stock held of record by such stockholder(s) as of the date of delivery of the request for a record date and prior to the date of delivery of the first written consent with respect to the Action shall constitute a revocation of such request with respect to such shares, (iv) a statement that the stockholder(s) intend to solicit consents in accordance with Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, without reliance on the exemption contained in Rule 14a-2(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, and (v) documentary evidence that the requesting stockholder(s) own in the aggregate the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary; provided, however, that if the requesting stockholder(s) are not the beneficial owner(s) of the shares representing the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, then to be valid, the written request must also include documentary evidence that the beneficial owner(s) on whose behalf the request for a record date is made beneficially own the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary. In addition, the requesting stockholder(s) and the beneficial owner(s), if any,
9
shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation.
(c) In determining whether a record date has been requested by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, multiple requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together only if (i) each request identifies substantially the same proposed action and includes substantially the same text of the proposal (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), and (ii) such request(s) have been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated request. A stockholder may revoke a request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation.
Section 2.13. Conduct of Meetings.
The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
Section 2.14.    Inspectors of Elections; Opening and Closing the Polls.
(a)
The Board of Directors, in advance of any stockholders' meeting, by resolution may appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated as alternative inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternative has been appointed to act, or if all inspectors or alternatives who have been appointed are unable to act, at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon
10
which the stockholders will vote at a meeting.
(b)
In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Section 2.12 and applicable law, to the Corporation of written consent or written consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall appoint one or more inspectors for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspector(s) to perform such review, no action by written consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspector(s) have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with Section 2.12 and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained herein shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the inspector(s), or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
ARTICLE III
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Section 3.1.    General Powers.
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 3.2. Number; Qualifications.
The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, the number to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.
Section 3.3. Election; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies.
At the first annual meeting of stockholders and at each annual meeting thereafter, the stockholders shall elect directors by a majority of the votes cast unless the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, in which case the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares entitled to vote on the election of directors and represented in person or by proxy at such meeting casting their vote for a director must exceed the number of such votes cast against that director. If a nominee for director, who is not serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall not be elected. If a nominee for director, who is serving as a
11
director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall then make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Governance Committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the reasons for it within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or resignation will not participate in the Boards decision.
Each director shall hold office for a term of one year or until such time as his successor is elected and qualified. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at the election of directors.

Section 8.4. Interested Directors; Quorum.
No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders.

Rate Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all of such Lender's Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans (it being understood that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Borrower may convert the Loans of such Lender without converting the Loans of any other Lender) and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Base Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Base Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
 
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with a Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Base Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Base Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
 
(a) . If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs Generally
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate) or the L/C Issuer;
(ii) subject the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the
 
definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) . If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
(c) . A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten Business Days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
provided
 
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to ; or
Section 10.13
including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

(a) . If any Lender requests compensation under , or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to , then such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to or , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment.

ALTERA ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
REVENUE UP 21 PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY
San Jose, Calif
.,
July 24, 2012
 Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced second quarter sales of
$464.8 million
, up
21 percent
from the first quarter of 2012 and down
15 percent
from the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter net income was
$162.7 million
,
$0.50
per diluted share, compared with net income of
$115.8 million
,
$0.35
per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2012 and
$214.6 million
,
$0.65
per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011.
Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was
$175.3 million
. Altera repurchased 3.5 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $121.0 million. Altera ended the quarter with
$
3.5 billion
in cash and investments.
Altera's board of directors has increased the company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.10 per share, up from the previous dividend of $0.08 per share. The board of directors has declared that the next quarterly dividend will be paid on September 4, 2012 to stockholders of record on August 10, 2012.
Altera's board of directors has approved a 10.0 million share increase to the number of shares authorized for repurchase under the company's share repurchase program. There are now 14.6 million shares authorized by the board of directors for repurchase. Under the program, which was previously authorized by the board of directors, shares may be purchased in the open market from time to time at the discretion of the company's management.
 
"New product revenue surged this quarter, as sales of both 28-nm and 40-nm accelerated strongly, driving the sharp revenue improvement from the prior quarter. Though growth was quite broad, the results in our Telecom and Wireless vertical market were particularly notable," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Leading edge 28-nm FPGAs are creating more opportunities for us as we displace more ASICs and ASSPs. Our 28-nm competitive position remains strong. We estimate that to date we have secured the majority of available 28-nm FPGA design win value."
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress:

ALTERA ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
San Jose, Calif
.,
October 23, 2012
 Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced third quarter sales of
$495.0 million
, up
6 percent
from the second quarter of 2012 and down
5 percent
from the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter net income was
$157.5 million

per diluted share, compared with net income of
$162.7 million
,
$0.50
per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2012 and
$185.4 million
,
$0.57
per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011.
Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was
$460.5 million
. Altera repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $50.0 million. Altera ended the quarter with
$
3.7 billion
in cash and investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, to be paid on December 3, 2012 to stockholders of record on November 13, 2012.
"Despite uneven global economic conditions, Altera experienced relatively broad vertical market sequential growth with both our new and mainstream product categories performing well," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Our 28 nm opportunity pipeline exceeds that of any prior process node as FPGAs continue to displace ASICs. Altera is the only 28 nm FPGA supplier to offer production-qualified devices across our entire range of product families, which gives us clear advantage as we compete for design wins. Altera is the design-win value leader at 28 nm."

In addition to the information required by Section 2.10 or Section 2.11, as applicable, of Article II of these By-laws, the special meeting request shall include (i) a statement of the specific purpose(s) of the meeting, the matter(s) proposed to be acted on at the special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the special meeting, (ii) an acknowledgement by such stockholder(s) that any disposition of shares of the Voting Stock held of record by such stockholder(s) as of the date of delivery of the special meeting request and prior to the record date for the proposed special meeting of stockholders requested by such stockholder(s) shall constitute a revocation of such request with respect to such shares, and (iii) documentary evidence that the requesting stockholder(s) own in the aggregate the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary; provided, however, that if the requesting stockholder(s) are not the beneficial owner(s) of the shares representing the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, then to be valid, the written request must also include documentary evidence that the beneficial owner(s) on whose behalf the special meeting request is made beneficially own the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary. In addition, the requesting stockholder(s) and the beneficial owner(s), if any, shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation.
A special meeting requested by stockholder(s) shall be held at such date, time and place within or without the state of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any such special meeting shall be not more than 90 days after the request to call the special meeting by the stockholder(s) who satisfy the requirements of this Section 2.2 is received by the Secretary, unless a later date is required in order to allow the Corporation to file the information required under Item 8 (or any comparable or successor provision) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), if applicable.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a special meeting requested by the stockholder(s) shall not be held if: (i) the request for the special meeting does not comply with the provisions of these By-laws, (ii) the stated business to be brought before the special meeting is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law, (iii) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual or special meeting of stockholders to be held within 90 days after the Secretary receives the request for the special meeting and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the business of such meeting includes (among any other matters properly brought before the meeting) the business specified in the stockholder(s)' request for a special meeting, (iv) an annual or special meeting of stockholders that included an identical or substantially similar item of business ("Similar Business"), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, was held not more than 120 days before the special meeting request was received by the Secretary, or (v) the special meeting request was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law. For purposes of this Section 2.2, the election of directors shall be deemed to be Similar Business with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors, changing the size of the Board of Directors and filing of vacancies and/or newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors.
In determining whether a special meeting of stockholders has been requested by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, multiple special meeting requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together only if (i) each request identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the proposed special meeting and substantially the same matters proposed to be acted on at the proposed special meeting (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), and (ii) such request(s) have been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated special meeting request.
A stockholder may revoke a request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, and if, following such revocation, there are requests which have not been revoked from stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the requisite number of Voting Stock entitling the stockholder(s) to request the calling of a special meeting, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may cancel the special meeting. If none of the stockholder(s) who submitted the request for a special meeting appears or sends a qualified representative to present the nominations proposed to be presented or other business proposed to be conducted at the special meeting, the Corporation need not present such nominations or other business for a vote at such meeting.
Business transacted at all special meetings shall be confined to the matter(s) stated in the notice of special meeting. Business transacted at a special meeting requested by stockholders shall be limited to the matter(s) described in the special meeting request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matter(s) to the stockholders at any special meeting requested by stockholder(s).
The Chair of a special meeting shall determine all matter(s) relating to the conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, determining whether any nomination or other item of business has been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these By-laws, and if the Chair should so determine and declare that any nomination or other item of business has not been properly brought before the special meeting, then such business shall not be transacted at such meeting.
 
Special meetings of stockholders may not be called by any person or persons other than as specified by this Section 2.2.
Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting (if such date is different from the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting), and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 2.3. Notice of Meetings.
Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.
Section 2.4. Adjournments.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of these By-laws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Section 2.5. Quorum.
 
Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in his absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 2.6. Organization.
Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or a new proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot; provided, however, that any election for directors must be by ballot if demanded by any stockholder at the meeting before the election has begun. Voting for the election of directors at any meeting of stockholders shall be as specified in Section 3.3 of these By-laws. All other matters presented to the stockholders for a vote at a meeting at which a quorum is present, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively.
Section 2.7. Voting; Proxies.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting and (2) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of the stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.
Section 2.8. Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.
 
The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10
Section 2.9. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote.
th
day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least 10 days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place other than the principal place of business of the Corporation, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
 
At a meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. The proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (1) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (2) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or (3) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.10 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.10. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (3) of this Section 2.10, the stockholder(s) must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely for an annual meeting of the stockholders, a stockholder(s)' notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not less than 120 days or more than 180 days prior to the first anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, then notice by the stockholder(s) to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made. To be timely for a special meeting of the stockholders, a stockholder(s)' notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not later than the 15th day following the day on which the public announcement of the date of such special meeting is first made. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of the stockholders or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Other than with respect to stockholder proposals relating to director nomination(s) which requirements are set forth in Section 2.11 below, stockholder(s)' notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (a) as to each matter the stockholder(s) propose to bring before the meeting: (i) a brief description of the business the stockholder(s) desire to bring before the meeting, (ii) the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), and (iii) the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below): (i) the name and address of the stockholder(s), as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such Stockholder Associated Person proposing such business, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by the stockholder(s) and such Stockholder Associated Person, (iii) any material interest of the stockholder(s) or Stockholder Associated

their respective affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, (v) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business, (vi) a representation whether the stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies or votes from stockholders in support of such proposal, (vii) any other information relating to such stockholder and Stockholder Associated Person, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (viii) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including, but not limited to, any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss or increase profit to or manage the risk or benefit of stock price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder(s) or any such Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation (each, a "Relevant Hedge Transaction"), and (ix) to the extent not set forth pursuant to the immediately preceding clause, (a) whether and the extent to which such stockholder(s) or Stockholder Associated Person has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise, or any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation (a "Derivative Instrument"), (b) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder(s) or Stockholder Associated Person that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (c) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder(s) or Stockholder Associated Person are a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (d) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder(s) are entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder(s)' immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder(s) and beneficial owner(s), if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date).
Section 2.10. Stockholder Proposals at Any Meeting of Stockholders.
 
For purposes of this Section 2.10 and Section 2.11, "Stockholder Associated Person" of any stockholder shall mean (i) any person controlling or controlled by, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and (iii) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Stockholder Associated Person.
For purposes of this Section 2.10 and Section 2.11, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or other national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The Chairman of a meeting of stockholders shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10 and the other provisions of these By-laws, and if the Chairman should so determine he or she shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
Nothing in this Section 2.10 shall affect the right of a stockholder to request inclusion of a proposal in the Corporation's proxy statement to the extent that such right is provided by an applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposal, such proposal shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.10, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
 
In addition to any other applicable requirements, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board of Directors or by stockholder(s) of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who comply with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 and the other provisions of these By-laws. Such nominations shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation's principal executive offices in accordance with these By-laws. To be timely for an annual meeting of the stockholders, a stockholder(s)' notice must be delivered to the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than 120 days or more than 180 days prior to the first Anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, then notice by stockholder(s) to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made.

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these By-laws.
Section 2.11. Nominations of Persons For Election to the Board of Directors.
 
The Chairman of a meeting of stockholders shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.11 and the other provisions of these By-laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 2.12. Action By Consent of Stockholders.
(a) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders or may be effected by a consent in writing by stockholders as provided by, and subject to the limitations in, the Certificate of Incorporation and this Section 2.12.
(b) A request by a stockholder for a record date in accordance with Article Eighth of the Certificate of Incorporation must be delivered by the holders of record of at least twenty percent (20%) (the "Voting Stock") of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to express consent on the relevant action, must describe the action that the stockholder proposes to take by consent (the "Action") and must contain (i) the text of the proposal (including the text of any resolutions to be effected by consent), (ii) the information required by Section 2.2 of these bylaws, to the extent applicable, as though the stockholder(s) making the request were making a Special Meeting Request in furtherance of the Action, (iii) an acknowledgment by such stockholder(s) that any disposition of shares of the Voting Stock held of record by such stockholder(s) as of the date of delivery of the request for a record date and prior to the date of delivery of the first written consent with respect to the Action shall constitute a revocation of such request with respect to such shares, (iv) a statement that the stockholder(s) intend to solicit consents in accordance with Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, without reliance on the exemption contained in Rule 14a-2(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, and (v) documentary evidence that the requesting stockholder(s) own in the aggregate the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary; provided, however, that if the requesting stockholder(s) are not the beneficial owner(s) of the shares representing the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, then to be valid, the written request must also include documentary evidence that the beneficial owner(s) on whose behalf the request for a record date is made beneficially own the requisite twenty percent (20%) or more of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary. In addition, the requesting stockholder(s) and the beneficial owner(s), if any, shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation.
(c) In determining whether a record date has been requested by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the Voting Stock as of the date of such written request to the Secretary, multiple requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together only if (i) each request identifies substantially the same proposed action and includes substantially the same text of the proposal (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), and (ii) such request(s) have been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated request. A stockholder may revoke a request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation.
 
The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

(a) The Board of Directors, in advance of any stockholders' meeting, by resolution may appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated as alternative inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternative has been appointed to act, or if all inspectors or alternatives who have been appointed are unable to act, at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting.
(b) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Section 2.12 and applicable law, to the Corporation of written consent or written consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall appoint one or more inspectors for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspector(s) to perform such review, no action by written consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspector(s) have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with Section 2.12 and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained herein shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the inspector(s), or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 3.1. General Powers.
Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, the number to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.
Section 3.2. Number; Qualifications.
At the first annual meeting of stockholders and at each annual meeting thereafter at which a quorum is present, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election, provided that if, as of the 10th day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section 3.3, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director must exceed the number of such votes cast "against" that director (with "abstentions" and "broker non-votes" not counted as votes cast either "for" or "against" that director's election). If a nominee for director, who is not serving as a director of the Corporation at the time of such election, does not receive a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such nominee shall not be elected. In order for any incumbent director to become a nominee of the Board of Directors for further service on the Board of Directors, such person must submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (i) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors in accordance with the policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors for such purpose. In the event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election which is not a Contested Election, the Nominating and Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose (by a press release and filing an appropriate disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission) its decision regarding the resignation (and, if such resignation is rejected, the rationale behind the decision) within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. The Nominating and Governance Committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision each may consider any factors and other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his resignation. If such director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal.
Section 3.3. Election; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies.
 
Each director shall hold office for a term of one year or until such time as his successor is elected and qualified, subject to such director's earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at the election of directors. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. Unless otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, any newly created directorship resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, failure to receive a majority of the votes cast at an election of directors, removal from office or any other cause may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining members of the Board of Directors, though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced or until his successor is elected and qualified, subject to such director's earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the whole Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such times as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine, and if so determined notices thereof need not be given.
Section 3.4. Regular Meetings.
Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Lead Independent Director, or any two members of the Board of Directors. Notice of the special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting at least 24 hours before the special meeting, personally, by facsimile, by electronic transmission or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class mail, telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that directors' address as it is shown on the records of the Corporation. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of the special meeting or the place of the special meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal office of the Corporation.
Section 3.5. Special Meetings.
 
Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this By-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Section 3.6. Telephonic Meetings Permitted.
At all meetings of the Board of Directors fifty percent (50%) of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except in cases in which the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws or applicable law otherwise provide, the vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, then notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment in the manner specified in these By-laws.
Section 3.7. Quorum; Vote Required for Action; Adjournment.
Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 3.8. Organization.
Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee in accordance with applicable law.
Section 3.9. Consent in Lieu of Meeting of Directors.
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. This Section 3.10 shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise and receiving compensation for those services.
Section 3.10. Fees and Compensation of Directors.
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the Corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the Corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the Corporation. To the extent permitted by applicable law, such loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the Corporation. Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the Corporation at common law or under any statutes.
Section 3.11. Approval of Loans to Officers.
The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it, but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by statute to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any By-law of the Corporation.
Section 4.1. Committees.
Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, each committee designated by the Board of Directors may make, alter and repeal rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of such rules each committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board of Directors conducts its business pursuant to Article III of these By-laws.
Section 4.2. Committee Rules.
 
The officers of the Corporation shall be a president, a secretary, and a chief financial officer. The Corporation may also have, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a chairman of the board, one or more vice presidents, one or more assistant secretaries, one or more assistant treasurers, and such other officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 of these By-laws. Any number of offices may be held by the same person.
Section 5.1. Officers.
The officers of the Corporation except such officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 or Section 5.5 of these By-laws, shall be chosen by the board, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment. Each officer shall hold office for such term as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors and until such person's successor shall have been duly chosen and qualified, or until such person's earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal.
Section 5.2. Election of Officers.
The Board of Directors may appoint, or may empower the president to appoint, such other officers as the business of the Corporation may require, each of whom shall hold office for such period, have such authority, and perform such duties as are provided in these By-laws or as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.
Section 5.3. Subordinate Officers.
Subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment, any officer may be removed, either with or without cause, by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting of the board or, except in case of an officer chosen by the Board of Directors, by any officer upon whom such power of removal may be conferred by the Board of Directors.
Section 5.4. Removal and Resignation of Officers.
Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.
A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause shall be filled in the manner prescribed in these By-laws for regular appointments to that office.
Section 5.5. Vacancies in Offices.
The chairman of the board, if such an officer be elected, shall, if present, preside at meetings of the Board of Directors and exercise and perform such other powers and duties as may from time to time be assigned to him by the Board of Directors or as may be prescribed by these By-laws. If there is no president, then the chairman of the board shall also be the chief executive officer of the Corporation and shall have the powers and duties prescribed in Section 5.7 of these By-laws.
Section 5.6. Chairman of the Board.
 
Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as may be given by the Board of Directors to the chairman of the board, if there be such an officer, the president shall be the chief executive officer of the Corporation and shall, subject to the control of the Board of Directors, have general supervision, direction, and control of the business and the officers of the Corporation. He shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and, in the absence or nonexistence of a chairman of the board, at all meetings of the Board of Directors. He shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the office of president of a Corporation, and shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or these By-laws.
Section 5.7. President.
In the absence or disability of the president, the vice presidents, if any, in order of their rank as fixed by the Board of Directors or, if not ranked, a vice president designated by the Board of Directors, shall perform all the duties of the president and when so acting shall have all the powers of, and be subject to all the restrictions upon, the president. The vice presidents shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed for them respectively by the Board of Directors, these By-laws, the president or the chairman of the board.

The secretary shall keep or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the Corporation or such other place as the Board of Directors may direct, a book of minutes of all meetings and actions of directors, committees of directors and stockholders. The minutes shall show the time and place of each meeting, whether regular or special (and, if special, how authorized and the notice given), the names of those present at directors' meetings or committee meetings, the number of shares present or represented at stockholders' meetings, and the proceeding thereof.
Section 5.9. Secretary.
The secretary shall keep, or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the Corporation or at the office of the Corporation's transfer agent or registrar, as determined by resolution of the Board of Directors, a share register, or a duplicate share register, showing the names of all stockholders and their addresses, the number and classes of shares held by each, the number and date of certificates evidencing such shares, and the number and date of cancellation of every certificate surrendered for cancellation.
The secretary shall give, or cause to be given, notice of all meetings of the stockholders and of the Board of Directors required to be given by law or by these By-laws.

The chief financial officer shall keep and maintain, or cause to be kept and maintained, adequate and correct books and records of accounts of the properties and business transactions of the Corporation, including accounts of its assets, liabilities, receipts, disbursements, gains, losses, capital, retained earnings, and shares. The books of account shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any director.
Section 5.10. Chief Financial Officer.

The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all or any or all classes or series of stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. The shares of the Corporation's stock shall be entered in the books of the Corporation and registered as they are issued. Any certificates representing shares of stock shall be in such form as the Board of Directors shall prescribe. Every holder of stock represented by certificate shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the Corporation. Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue.
Section 6.1. Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.
Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation or its agent shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice that shall set forth the name of the Corporation, the name of the stockholder, the number of shares of the stock represented, and any restrictions on the transfer or registration of such shares of stock imposed by the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, any agreement among stockholders or any agreement between stockholders and the Corporation.
The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.
Section 6.2. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.
 
The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "proceeding") by reason of the fact that he, or a person for whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by such person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.3 of this Article VII, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by such person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 7.1. Right to Indemnification.
The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, the payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII or otherwise.
Section 7.2. Prepayment of Expenses.
If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Article VII is not paid in full within 60 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant shall thereupon (but not before) be entitled to file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim. If successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.
Section 7.3. Claims.
The rights conferred on any person by this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Section 7.4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights.
The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any director or officer who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit enterprise.
Section 7.5. Other Indemnification.
 
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any director or officer in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
Section 7.6. Amendment or Repeal.
This Article VII shall not limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than directors and officers when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.
Section 7.7. Other Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Section 8.1. Fiscal Year.
The corporate seal shall have the name of the Corporation inscribed thereon and shall be in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Section 8.2. Seal.
Section 8.3. Manner of Notice and Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders.
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein or permitted by applicable law, notices to stockholders shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed to the stockholders at their addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, and except as prohibited by applicable law, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By-laws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice permitted under this Section 8.3(a), shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
(b) Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
 
No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction.
Section 8.4. Interested Directors; Quorum.
Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account, and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs, or any other information storage device or method, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a reasonable time.
Section 8.5. Form of Records.
These By-laws may be altered or repealed, and new By-laws made, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders may make additional by-laws and may alter and repeal any by-laws whether adopted by them or otherwise.
Section 8.6. Amendment of By-laws.

Sales of the company's new products are expected to grow sequentially but that growth will be more than offset by lower sales of the company's older products.
 
Fourth quarter results will be released after the market close on January 23, 2013.

"While our new products had a double-digit sequential growth quarter, sales of our older products were softthe result of a sluggish global economy, " said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Sales of 40 nm devices, our largest selling process node, and where we are the market leader, are likely to strengthen further as we progress through 2013. At the most advanced process node, 28 nm, Altera remains the design-win value leader, giving us a substantial growth opportunity as these customer designs transition into production."

Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress:

from increasing frequency in single-core CPUs, to using multi-core CPUs, to using parallel processor arrays. Today, system designers are turning to FPGAs, which are fine-grained, massively parallel digital logic arrays architected to execute computations in parallel to create higher performance levels at a fraction of the power compared to other hardware alternatives. By allowing system developers and programmers familiar with C to quickly and easily develop high-performance, power-efficient FPGA-based applications in a high-level language, Altera's SDK for OpenCL enables customers to easily adopt FPGAs and leverage the performance and power benefits the devices provide. This unified, high-level design flow for hardware and software development automates the time-consuming tasks required in typical hardware-design language flows, and the resulting FPGA-based solution can deliver more than 5X performance/watt compared to alternative hardware implementations.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)    The following is a description of Altera Corporation's 2013 Bonus Plan provided pursuant to Paragraph 10(iii) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, which requires a written description of a compensatory plan when no formal document contains the compensation information.
Effective February 15, 2013, the compensation committee of the board of directors of Altera Corporation ("Altera") adopted Altera's Bonus Plan for the 2013 fiscal year. The purpose of the 2013 Bonus Plan is to promote the interests of Altera and its stockholders by providing key employees with financial rewards upon achievement of specified business objectives, as well as to help Altera attract and retain key employees by providing attractive compensation opportunities linked to performance results.
Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the three other most-highly-compensated officers, as well as all other executive officers, are eligible to participate in the 2013 Bonus Plan. Bonuses payable to our CEO and other officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, the "Executive Officers"), under the 2013 Bonus Plan will be determined by the compensation committee.
The target and maximum 2013 Bonus Plan payouts, each of which are a percentage of base salary that may be earned by each of our Executive Officers, are as follows:
The exact amount payable to an Executive Officer under the 2013 Bonus Plan will be determined at the sole discretion of the compensation committee. In exercising its discretion, the compensation committee will take into account Altera's operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2013 (the "Operating Margin Metric"), Altera's percent of revenue growth in 2013 as compared to 2012 (the "Revenue Growth Metric" and, together with the Operating Margin Metric, the "Financial Performance Metrics") and the individual Executive Officer's performance during the year. Each Financial Performance Metric will determine a Financial Performance Metric Payout Percentage (as specified in the table below) which will, in turn, determine the Bonus Plan payout percentage that may be earned by an Executive Officer.
For the purposes of determining the Operating Margin Metric, operating income is defined as earnings before interest and other income, interest expense, and taxes (including the expense associated with the 2013 Bonus Plan payout) divided by Net Sales.
For the purposes of determining the Operating Margin Metric and the Revenue Growth Metric, Net Sales is defined consistently with the convention used in Altera's reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The compensation committee shall have discretion to exclude significant, non-recurring items, as well as amounts attributable to Altera's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metrics. Significant non-recurring transactions are defined as items that could have a material effect on the outcome of the calculated bonus, are unusual in nature and occur infrequently. For purposes of the calculation, items are deemed to have a material effect if they have a positive or negative impact on Net Sales or operating margin income of greater than 1% of net sales or $10 million for the full-year impact (net of any resulting dollar savings) of each type of unusual or infrequently occurring item (whether they occur in one or more transactions). Unusual in nature refers to those transactions or events that possess a high degree of abnormality and are of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of Altera and the industry. Infrequency of occurrence refers to events or transactions of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future based on the nature of the company's normal operations and the industry. Examples of significant, non-recurring items that the compensation committee may elect to exclude from the calculation of the Financial Performance Metrics include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) restructuring charges as defined by U.S. GAAP; (2) business combinations as defined by U.S. GAAP; (3) asset impairment or discontinuation of operations recognized under U.S. GAAP; (4) earthquake, tsunami, flood, hurricane, typhoon, or fire resulting in an expense recognized under U.S. GAAP; and (5) other significant non-recurring transactions as appropriate.
A 2013 Bonus Plan payout percentage will be determined for each Executive Officer according to the following formula:
(Operating Margin Metric Payout Percentage * 60%) + (Revenue Growth Metric Payout Percentage * 40%) * Bonus Target Percentage = Bonus Plan Payout Percentage
The Bonus Plan payout percentage will be multiplied by the Executive Officer's base salary to determine a potential Bonus Plan payout. The compensation committee will then have the discretion to increase (up to the Bonus Plan maximum payout percentage), decrease or eliminate the actual amount payable under the 2013 Bonus Plan based on the Executive Officer's performance during the year, including his or her performance against goals that have been approved by the compensation committee. The compensation committee will have the discretion to make a Bonus Plan payout under the 2013 Bonus Plan even if the Bonus Plan payout percentage is 0%.
The Bonus Plan payout percentage will be calculated based on the following table:
If the results of a Financial Performance Metric do not appear on the above table, the applicable Financial Performance Metric Payout Percentage shall be calculated on a proportional basis. For example, if 2013 operating income as a percentage of revenue is 40.5%, the Operating Margin Metric Payout Percentage will be 130%.
In evaluating the performance of the Executive Officers other than the CEO, the compensation committee may take into account the CEO's evaluation of whether an individual has met his or her performance goals and the CEO's subjective assessment of overall performance. In evaluating the performance of the CEO, the compensation committee may take into account the CEO's self-assessment as well as the assessment of the independent members of the Board of Directors. The compensation committee's determination as to whether individual performance goals have been met may be subjective in nature.
Payment of bonuses (if any) will be made in February or March of 2014. Bonuses normally will be paid in cash in a single lump sum.

ALTERA ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
San Jose, Calif
.,
April 25, 2013
 Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced first quarter sales of
$410.5 million
, down
7 percent
from the fourth quarter of 2012 and up
7 percent
from the first quarter of 2012. First quarter net income was
$120.2 million
,
$0.37
per diluted share, compared with net income of
$120.8 million
,
$0.37
per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2012 and
$115.8 million
,
$0.35
per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2012.
Cash flow from operating activities was
$149.5 million
. Altera ended the quarter with $
3.8 billion
in cash and investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.10
per share, to be paid on
June 3, 2013
to stockholders of record on
May 10, 2013
.
"The quarter's overall sales were roughly as expected and represent the low point in the recent communications equipment and industrial cycles. We expect second quarter growth in these markets," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Development work for our next generation products is well under way. Using TSMC's 55 nm EmbFlash and their 20 nm planar technology plus Intel's 14 nm Tri-Gate process, we expect to have an optimized, competitively differentiated set of offerings, with notable performance improvements across all our products. As the only major FPGA company with access to the second-generation Tri-Gate process, we will benefit from much reduced implementation risk, the unique finFET power, performance and density advantages, and process availability long before any comparable alternative."
